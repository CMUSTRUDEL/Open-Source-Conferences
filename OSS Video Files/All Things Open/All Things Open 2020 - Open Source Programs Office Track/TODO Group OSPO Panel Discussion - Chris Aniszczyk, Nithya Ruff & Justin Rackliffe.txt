Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: This year, ATO will host an interactive panel discussion with TODO Group Members to share their responses to a recent survey conducted in partnership with the Linux Foundation. The survey identified the most important and pressing issues for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) around the world. 

Attendees should leave with a much better understanding of OSPOs in general, a better understanding of OSPO best practices, and a better understanding of OSPO related issues being experienced across the globe.

nithya rough

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
i run the open source office at comcast

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,080
as chris indicated

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,799
um i've been doing open source since 98

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,400
and i started running open source

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,960
program offices

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,520
in sandisk um around 2014-15

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,119
and then since then i've been uh doing

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,759
uh ospos and it's

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
it's one of the the best jobs i've had i

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,479
would say

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
and it's fun to be here chris

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
awesome glad to have you uh justin you

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
want to give yourself a little

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
background intro

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,799
yeah and uh justin raphael um so again

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,960
fidelity investments um

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
i'm still i still consider myself new to

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200
the osbo game

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,799
um very green still learning a whole lot

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,880
um but uh groups like to do and

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
people like chris and nithia have been

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
essential to

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
fidelity figuring out how to do open

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,040
source

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
in a way that makes sense to fidelity

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
austin fantastic to have you both and

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
getting this panel

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
organized in short time has been a fun

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,360
experience

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,200
um yeah so um before we kind of get

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
started with questions for our panelists

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
we'll do kind of a brief introduction of

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
what exactly

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
is an awesome vote since a lot of people

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
sometimes aren't aware of it we'll talk

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
a little bit about the history of the

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
to-do group and then we'll hand it

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
off for kind of questions that i've

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
prepared

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
uh today and also potentially from the

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,879
audience before we kind of close

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
uh things out so a little bit of uh

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
background so

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,760
you know hey we're on an ospo panel

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
what's an ospo so

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
as a group we've come together to help

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,239
kind of you know

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,440
define our our field our practices and

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
you know essentially you know job that

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
many folks do within the uh to do groups

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,440
so

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
we've essentially come to this

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
definition that an ospo is basically the

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
center of competition competency for an

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
organization's

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
open source operations and structure you

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,519
know this can include

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,599
setting policies around you know

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,360
distribution auditing

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,120
you know selection of open source as

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,480
well of training you know developers in

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
the company to ensure that they're

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,360
compliant with all sorts of open source

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
practices uh and so on um you know we

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,239
found from our experience that you know

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
since ospos are

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
fairly uh a new thing you know i think

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
you know depending on how far you want

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
to go back in time whether

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
you know sun or ibm you know had the

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
first kind of open source program

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
there really isn't traditionally one way

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
to kind of um

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
do this uh you know overall some of

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,920
these ospos tend to live

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
in engineering organizations maybe an

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,120
office of the cto

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560
sometimes in legal departments if you

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
know compliance is the most important

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,080
thing so i think the key point

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
that we want to share is you know ospos

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
are essentially the center of competency

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
for

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
you know open source activities and

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
organization um but there are many ways

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
to kind of build them out if you look at

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,599
the

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
uh definition github repo that we put

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,200
together uh it features some great

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
examples across the industry

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
um that you could kind of uh look at uh

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,840
the to do group was formed about a

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
little over five years ago and it was

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,879
essentially

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,200
formed as a reaction for uh some of us

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
who

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
were running ospos at the time including

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
myself who was at twitter at the time

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
building out their

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,959
open source program and we're

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
essentially running this problem of we

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
were

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,200
sharing tools and ideas of like how do

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,359
you use github to

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,639
scale to thousands of engineers or how

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,199
are you you know doing

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
you know onboarding training a new hire

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
orientation and so on and so is

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
eventually

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
what happened you know this kind of

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,040
private mailing list of individuals

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,080
across companies eventually turned into

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,759
a formal uh group that we announced um

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
at facebook's uh conference at the time

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
a little over uh

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
five five six years ago uh now and

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
essentially what it's grown to outside

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
of a

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,560
initial handful of companies that were

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
generally

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,919
let's say silicon valley biased we've

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
grown to feature companies

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
all over the world from you know

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
different industries verticals

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,199
uh to you know as far as you know

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
different geographies

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
out there you know recently had uh

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,639
deutsche bahn uh join which is the

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
german essentially train company and you

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
know they're building out an open source

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
program so it's kind of always

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
interesting to see

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,479
uh different organizations out there

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
building open source programs and we're

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
even seeing

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
you know things outside of typical

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
companies we're seeing you know academia

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
and you know governments doing this so

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
it's super exciting and

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
we're essentially the group of folks you

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
know that you know band together to

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
help you know build educational

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
materials share best practices and even

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
share

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
you know tools that we develop so it's

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,199
basically who we are as an organization

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
um a couple things that you know to show

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,840
before we

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
kind of uh get into our questions for

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
our steam panelists is

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,639
uh one of our outputs tends to be an

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,919
open source survey that we do around

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,680
ospos every year

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
um if you go to the github link to do

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
group slash survey on github

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
we share all the data and all that good

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,520
stuff you go kind of

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
you know get questions answered that you

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
may commonly

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,919
um you know think about when you uh do

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
open source programs with organizations

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
from like

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,199
where does the ospo live how big is it

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,440
um how is the oscar reacting to the

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
pandemic these days on top of you know

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
where osbos are investing so i think

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
this is one of our

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
you know great outputs and deliverables

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
we do uh every year and if you have any

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
questions or

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
want to modify this it's all open on

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
github available for you to send prs and

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
questions for future

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,919
future surveys uh and then finally you

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
know

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,280
one of the probably best outputs we've

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,919
also done is our guides if you go to

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,800
twogroup.org.guides essentially these

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,160
are all about like

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
how do you start your own open source

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
program what tools would you use

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
um how do you unfortunately potentially

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
archive a project if you ever have to do

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,720
that within your open source

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,319
organizations and so on so

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
i highly recommend that you take a look

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,000
at all these wonderful guides

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
we have a variety of translations out

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
there and

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
we always look forward to kind of

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,280
sharing what we've developed amongst

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
ourselves so

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,560
um that's kind of the rough little

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
history of you know what to do group is

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
what an ospo is and so on really the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,880
heart of this discussion today

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
is hearing expert opinions from our

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,680
panelists and

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,440
um you know i'd love to kind of kind of

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,759
dive into that so

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
you know uh first kind of you know set

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
of questions here before we kind of

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,560
jump in for the audience is we'll kind

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
of go over these but

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
you know maybe we'll start with um you

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
know nifia here because

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
you know everyone has kind of started

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,000
their career in osbos differently

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,840
sometimes you know it's

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
self-selecting an engineer just wants to

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
care about open source sometimes you

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
know someone's roped in it through

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
another way so i would love to hear

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
about

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
justin anithia's perspective on this i

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,919
know and if you touch a little bit this

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
about this on your role in sandisk but

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,560
we'd love to learn a little bit more so

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,720
how did you get started in uh in open

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,919
source program management in india

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,880
i know um so the way it happened

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
i was in one of the divisions of sandisk

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,720
and

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,599
by background um i'm a product marketing

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
and product manager uh type of a person

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,639
so i was

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,639
playing the role of product marketing

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,479
and a lot of the work that i was doing

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,960
to launch this project

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
uh was open source oriented was working

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,800
with legal

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
on licenses and contributions and

00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,919
working with our development

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
team on how they would upstream their

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,240
patches and things of that nature

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
because our product was completely open

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,560
source based it was based on ceph

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,160
and as i was doing more of this open

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,479
source work it dawned on me

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
that other divisions in the company were

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
also

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,199
doing a lot of open source work and

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,199
there was no one central place

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,919
for consistently um documenting and

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,520
solving

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
you know some of these challenges that

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,280
we all faced

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,360
so i pitched the idea of starting an

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,560
open source program office to our senior

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,959
vice president

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
and our chief strategy officer and i

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
said you know

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,719
we really need one because we have every

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
division doing its own thing we have

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,000
developers kind of willy-nilly

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,920
uh doing uh participation contribution

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,279
and legal is getting inundated with

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,480
questions so

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
i think i i'm happy to be an open source

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
program office for you

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,959
and so they said okay uh pitch us what

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,920
you would do for the first 90 days and

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,000
how you would make an impact and i had

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,640
to write up a list of things

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,640
i would do as an ospo and it was

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
extremely helpful to actually

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,360
look at the tudor group website and talk

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,640
to various oscar people

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,760
and and i was a one-woman shop i i

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,959
ran the ospo for comcast

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,160
um you know across uh almost

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,200
four or five thousand developers um and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,200
it was super fun

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
awesome that's a that's a that's a

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,920
interesting uh beginning

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
it's always nice when you can write your

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
own job description it's always always

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,279
the

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
and best just left me alone to do my

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,080
thing

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,000
awesome that's fantastic uh yeah and so

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,680
um you know justin you know the the

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
financial you know world tends to be a

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
little bit different than you know the

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
sandisk which is kind of you know

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,040
hardware traditional

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
you know kind of hardware focused

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,240
company so i'd learn love to learn you

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
know kind of your story of how it

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
started in

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,160
in fidelity and financial land in

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
general which tends to have a different

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,920
view of the world

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,680
yeah sure i mean for for the longest

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
time fidelity

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,480
approached us with a board because

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,480
everybody loves a bureaucratic board

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
architectural review boards put a bunch

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,279
of senior technologists together to make

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,160
uh decisions potentially arbitrary uh

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,519
based around what the news is of the day

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,600
and that board was was functional um

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,800
for a long time they established our

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
policy

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
we have we have alumnus of the to do

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
group

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
that helped to kick it off back in like

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,360
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,720
2012. and um

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
there was a thing that happened

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
beginning at 2017

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,000
around an apache project that let's say

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,640
scared some folks not to name names

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
um but they were it was with people's

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
personal

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,600
personal identifiable data and

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,720
relatively financial services related um

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
and folks went

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,640
uh-oh um where do we stand on this and

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
they realized

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,120
a board um kind of like a volunteer

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
firefighter organization

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
is not the most accountable type of

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
party

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
uh because hey they have a they have a

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
day job um this is something they were

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,240
doing in the back side

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,959
so i had been working with the openstack

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
foundation

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,360
on some of their and openstack project

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,399
on the enterprise working group

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,000
and i was actually on vacation i got an

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,800
email with my new org chart i heard

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
somebody decided that i knew what how to

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,880
spell

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,440
gpl and uh that for and therefore

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,640
i was qualified to run a program office

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
um

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
so uh one of the first things i do is i

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
think i sent something to the info at to

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,680
do group and said

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,480
hey um what can i what can i do to

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
learn real fast um and i ended up

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
showing up uh

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,360
as a non-member chris actually allowed

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
me to show up

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
at the amazon building at doppler a

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,720
couple years back

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
and again it's just been it's been

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
trying to learn

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
a little bit on the fly ever since um

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,279
but

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
again we're trying to figure it out and

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
the good thing is fidelity is

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,560
is willing to kind of invest in that

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
environment and know that it's the right

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
thing to do

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,600
for the future um and there's plenty of

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,360
lessons to be learned

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
awesome yeah it's it's interesting how

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
for some people it's usually maybe like

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
a specific pain point

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
you know someone uses gpl code

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,160
accidentally all of a sudden like

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560
someone needs to own this and

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
you know i always see the transition of

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
i definitely see a lot of open source

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
programs starting kind of as like the

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
architecture review board style or it's

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
like a part-time responsibility for

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,920
someone until

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
maybe some serious problem hits like oh

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
wait a minute we need full-time

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,839
ownership because

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,079
it's not working so it's awesome

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,440
um so yeah so we have you know a limited

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,120
amount of time and some questions to

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
continue to kind of go through i think

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
both those stories are great and

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
especially if you talk to other people

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
starting open source programs they could

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,639
tell you that you know

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
it's almost always different and usually

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
starts from kind of an initiative or

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
pain point within the organization

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,920
so a lot of questions i sometimes get

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
fielded is like so as a you know a head

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
of an ospo

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,839
what's kind of your you know your day to

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
day like you know you know are you

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,519
sitting there reviewing

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,800
what packages you know developers use

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,399
are you coming up with you know

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
strategies of you know where you should

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
invest resources so

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
you know be good to kind of you know

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,160
understand you know you know how you go

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
about your day or

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
or week and you know maybe just like

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,120
planning

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,800
um and kind of priorities and you know

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,160
maybe you know we could kind of combine

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
this with the next question around

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
kind of like priorities so on so like

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
kind of where you're focusing on

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,279
uh now and maybe how that's kind of um

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
shifting so let's see if we may combine

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
those because i think they're kind of

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
related

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
uh questions okay uh maybe you know

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
nithya you want to go take this one

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,600
first

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,519
yeah absolutely you know as you pointed

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,240
out every organization is different

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,800
everybody's journey to ospo is different

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
uh

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
but one of the common things you find is

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,279
oscar leaders

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,959
are bridge builders they're translators

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,920
they're connectors they

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,560
are in service or they're developer

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,600
advocates

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
across the organization and i find that

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,320
all of my peers in the to-do group are

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
amazing versatile people who can really

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
kind of go across lots of different

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,880
topics

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,440
reason i say that is because at any

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,800
given point i'll start off the day

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,959
talking to legal about contributions or

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
some compliance related issue and then

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,160
may end the day

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
talking to the linux foundation or

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,839
somewhere in the middle

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,639
i may talk to a developer or i may talk

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,600
to our

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,880
public relations and comms team about a

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
blog we want to post

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,600
or a pr we want to do so you're kind of

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
constantly pivoting i think

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
uh between different topics because we

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
really

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,920
serve all of those needs from compliance

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,120
all the way to communications

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
and community so in terms of my

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,279
priorities

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
especially this year my priorities have

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,519
been

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,120
i i jokingly say compliance compliance

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,760
compliance

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
but seriously compliance and automating

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,199
our compliance

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,480
shifting left compliance so that

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
engineering owns it

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
in the product development process

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,320
automating that

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,920
is one big uh you know multi-year

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,839
priority if you will

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,920
the second one is um really spreading

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,760
inner source and collaboration culture

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,120
inside the organization

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,199
breaking down silos teaching some of the

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
collaborative practices we use in open

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,040
source

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,279
inside the company and the third one is

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
automating and scaling all of our

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,480
processes

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
because we're a really tiny ospo and we

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,920
have thousands of developers and we

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,720
cannot afford to reach everybody

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,560
unless we you know automate our open

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,759
source contribution request process

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,360
or our compliance process and so

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,279
yeah that's that's exactly what we're

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
doing

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,160
awesome fantastic automation makes a lot

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,000
of sense justin what about you

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,399
um so most of the time especially lately

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,800
i've been waking up to emails and

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,680
meetings from my audit team

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
so yay always a good way to start the

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,560
morning definitely

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:24,000
go with the espresso on those days

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,880
but uh it it really varies uh as nymphia

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
kind of called out

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,920
it's you're you're the locust you're the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,320
traffic cop

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,279
uh for a lot of things i think one one

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
area that

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
i find that fidelity approaches a little

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,480
bit differently than some

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,600
is i'm part of our procurement

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,360
process so as we source services or

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,959
products

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,639
i'll be engaged to do an open source

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,639
review to the best of my ability and

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,360
whatever they will give me

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
some organizations because they have a

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
distribution

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
are more free with their bill of

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,480
materials others are not

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
um but i'll try to convince them and say

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
hey we're going to protect this

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,120
but you have our data you have our

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,120
content and your practices and processes

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,640
matter to me because if you're breached

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,319
they aren't going to just blame you

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,160
they're going to blame because fidelity

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,520
data they're going to blame us

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,520
and really trying to build those

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,199
relationships and those partnerships

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,839
even outside of fidelity around

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,480
open source supply chain practices and

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,120
integrity there

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
probably for priorities developer

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,240
experience

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
i still don't think we do the greatest

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
job of it

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
we have cobol developers all the way up

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,520
to

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,039
um leading edge mobile app development

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,039
and it all involves open source

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,799
but the needs are drastically different

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
the risk tolerance is drastically

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,120
different

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,320
so looking at processes that make sense

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
that are rational

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,400
and at some level can adapt to the

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,280
individual

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
team needs that allowed me to give them

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
some choice

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
um make smart and make smart choices

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
experiment

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,480
um have some fun and uh but protect

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,559
fidelity's interests

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,160
um so i think that's probably number one

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,120
everybody's automating everything i

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:24,559
count that as developer experience

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:27,200
and i think just getting people to

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
to really not look at software as a

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,400
zero-sum game

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,000
as an ever-present challenge um

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
matt ac kind of called it out in the

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,360
keynote um

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,360
around saying no like we can all create

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
this stuff we can all contribute to the

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,520
same thing

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,160
and it makes actually more um

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
really new concepts especially to folks

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,679
like the financial services industry

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,559
where barriers were high

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,120
so essentially keeping those those moats

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
um

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,480
deep actually was the competitive

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,440
advantage um

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,919
so retraining folks is another big

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,919
priority

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,280
awesome fan fantastic i could see how

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
there's a little you know a little

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,880
overlap of kind of what both open source

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,919
programs you know do it com comcast and

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
fellaini but with a little different

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,160
focus

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,640
uh areas so another thing um you know to

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
discuss

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
is you know as i mentioned in the

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
beginning ospos tend to

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,960
you know be structured differently

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,559
depending on the type of organization

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,880
what they care for i would

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,559
love to kind of hear you know um you

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,120
know uh where your ospo

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
currently lives uh you know how large is

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
the team and kind of roughly what roles

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,280
they do

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,880
because you know i've seen teams that

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,520
have you know

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
it's a just one person or it's a it's an

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
army of you know

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
20 folks so i'd love to kind of hear how

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
things are are structured

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,000
um within uh within your organization

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,440
so um at comcast um

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,760
chris i started off as the only person

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,840
but uh now over the course of three

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,600
years we are about a six people

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,880
on office including myself and

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,840
we report into the cto of comcast

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,480
uh cable basically comkins does multiple

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,360
businesses

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
but cable is where we live and then we

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,120
do help

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,039
other smaller ospos in the comcast

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,840
entities like sky

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,600
or dreamworks or nbc but we

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,360
predominantly take care of the cable

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,640
business because most of the engineers

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
are there

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,559
and uh the roles are um

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
at least what we've determined is that

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,640
we needed

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,559
you know a few folks on compliance um

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,559
and a couple of folks on community

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,120
management whether it's

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,039
external and internal community or

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,840
working with certain key

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
organizations like the cncf or the octo

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,919
project which

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,200
are we are very uh aligned with

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,240
so they do that and then we also

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,480
um really created a position as an open

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,799
source developer

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,600
so we have a principal engineer who

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,720
helps us do

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,200
a lot of the automation a lot of the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
uh engineering work if you will behind

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,679
the ospo

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,240
and metrics and you know uh making sure

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
that

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
some of the infrastructure that we have

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
runs

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,360
um so so that's that's what we've set it

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
up as

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,640
okay very cool it's interesting that

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
there's like a network of ospos across

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
the different uh i guess umbrella

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,039
companies since comcast is a

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,640
massive uh or organization so cool mix

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,320
of program management and engineering

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
uh justin how about how about you what's

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,600
how's how are things over there

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,400
i am the ospo no like the just

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,200
quote in your head so a team of team of

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
one

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
um especially with with i would say a

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
mature company

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559
bureaucracy is always a risk like all of

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,760
a sudden people want to start building

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
armies

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
um and and developers don't tend to take

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
that well

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,000
um so in some ways it helps me

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,080
make sure that what i'm doing is

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,280
scalable and makes sense

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,600
to the all the community at large so i

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,919
have to have those relationships

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,000
um i have to build confidence and

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,440
credibility to our legal team compliance

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,039
audit fill in the blank and

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,679
be able to prioritize we aren't

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,240
let's say the most public company out

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,360
there

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
in more ways than one which again helps

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,679
me scale where

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
where i'm at today um but when we

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,480
actually

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,000
quit if i hit a blocker if throughput

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,960
starts kind of choke off

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,679
things that's when we solve that problem

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
we won't do

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,880
is is build up the army to magically

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,320
solve the problem that doesn't exist yet

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,400
um so we may not ever get there so

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,000
i'm currently kind of aligned with our

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
cloud organization

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
um and that's more of a historical thing

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,640
than anything else

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,520
um but again cloud and open source

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
uh it's peanut butter and chocolate um

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
so

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,240
uh there's a lot of value in in

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
alignment in being able to say

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,200
okay cool this is where we're going this

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,760
is what we're using um

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,440
and and making a difference there

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,720
awesome and so maybe like a related

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
question would be like what would be

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
your

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,360
ideal size so like if you if you could

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
have another head count what would you

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,039
like focus on or what you're doing that

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,880
both maybe nithya and justin you could

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,240
uh answer this because i think the ideal

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
size of an ospo is going to be different

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,000
for the organization

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
uh obviously

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
i think justin brought up a really good

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,120
point all of us

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,440
are very dependent upon uh part-time

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,480
legal help part-time comms help

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
you know lots of groups help us um so we

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,640
don't do

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,640
everything ourselves so if i had um

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,279
yeah i would say i need more developers

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,400
in my team

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,799
because we want to do more upstream

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,080
contribution on the osco infrastructure

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,720
and tooling side

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,080
and we also want to automate more and we

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
really struggle with

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,080
one principal engineer he's absolutely

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
fantastic

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,720
but um we don't have redundancy you know

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,880
in case something happens

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,000
uh we we don't have a backup for him and

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
we also need

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,159
to we operate for example the compliance

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,039
tools ourselves

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,440
and we do a ticketing system for

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,360
compliance and other things and so

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
i i really would could use another

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,480
developer or two

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
yeah i didn't mean to put everyone on

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
the spot there but i think it's an

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,360
interesting

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,760
question i'll help justify more head

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,760
count for you that would be great

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,200
i know for me it probably would be the

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,240
the social media side

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
i mean external com it's hard in a

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
regulated industry

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,919
there's a lot of pre-reviews there's a

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,720
lot of gates you got to hit

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,840
and it takes a lot of time but it's

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,640
something that

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,520
you have to do but a lot of times it

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
falls down my priorities back

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,880
because it just has some limited

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,640
bandwidth uh so

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,679
figuring out a way to find somebody um

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,240
to dedicate to kind of raising our brand

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
there

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,720
in a way that our our compliance and

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,320
auditors will be okay with

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,799
awesome yeah i definitely have a lot of

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,120
challenges there from a regulation point

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,120
point of view that i'm uh not not

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,559
envious of by any means um

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,480
so you know i want to definitely be

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,919
sensitive of time and leave some time

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,600
for the audience ask questions i'll ask

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,799
a couple more you know obviously we're

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,360
kind of in this

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,200
uh you know wild uh you know times in

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,880
2020 with the pandemic

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,640
affecting you know many people's you

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,600
know livelihoods and you know we're all

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,720
you know remote

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,960
uh now how has kind of this um

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
affected um you know your team in an

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,159
environment has it basically caused an

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
acceleration

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,760
in investment is there more of a you

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
know are they using you know open source

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
has almost been inherently distributed

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
from

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
from day one right and so we have a lot

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
of lessons when it comes to

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
collaboration remote so i'd like to love

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
to learn what the the impact

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,600
um you know kind of has been in this in

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,240
this in the age of pandemic and coven

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,960
copen 19.

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,440
you know i most of my team are

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,480
distributed some in philadelphia and

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,159
and kind of all over the place and i

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
used to really rely on

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,760
physical presence i would go to philly

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,400
once a month to

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
spend time with my team so that changed

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
dramatically

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,559
and um i i have to say

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,919
it's been a fantastic year from the

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,159
perspective that

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,760
we've really bonded as a team and we've

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
spent a lot more team

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,320
time together so one of the first

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,640
priorities for us was

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,159
making sure our teams were safe that

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,200
they weren't stressed

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,000
and that they had all the tools

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,120
and you know techniques necessary to

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
work virtually

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,640
because i worked virtually but a lot of

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
my team

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,559
were used to going to comcast technology

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,840
center and working from there

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,480
um so that was important and then

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,559
making you know no meeting days and

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,360
encouraging people to take time off

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,400
because you you kind of think i i'm

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,559
always at home

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,240
so i'm not going to take time off

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,799
because i'm not going anywhere

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,799
but people really really need to

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
de-stress during this time so we've

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,200
tried to do that

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,559
um we've had a lot of people attending

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
virtual events

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,880
from all of our developer base because a

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,159
it's less expensive

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,120
it's easy to hop on to a zoom or

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,880
so we've had record attendance at open

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200
source summit and kubecon and

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
all things open and you know all of

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,919
these inner source summit and

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,840
so on and so forth so i would say uh

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,520
those have been some of the changes

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,080
i don't think we've scaled back the

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,120
organization but we are

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,559
being very very careful um about the

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,679
budget because

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,360
uh it's been a crazy here financially

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
for some parts of the business but not

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,960
for the other parts of the business

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,559
got it justin you have anything to share

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,279
on on this

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,200
i mean i think it's it's similar um

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,919
luckily i have to travel for teams

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,840
uh but fidelity gets a lot of stuff done

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,720
via human to human high bandwidth

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,880
conversations and you can replace that

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,320
with zoom meetings

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,240
so helping people kind of adapt to an

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,159
asynchronous work style

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,960
being you need to solve this and it

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,720
needs to be time zone independent

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,080
and it needs to have a record-keeping

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,520
system

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,600
doesn't that sound like source code

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,799
doesn't it sound like issue management

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,960
like um trying to to kind of break

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,159
people of bad habits and crutches

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,840
um it's been again a challenge i won't

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,240
say i've made the the hugest amount of

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,919
rock

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,000
uh progress there um

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,000
but it's something that i think is

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,600
uniquely positioned for an ospo to kind

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,039
of lead in an organization

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,039
is saying as open source projects and

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,279
experience in open source projects

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,960
you know how to lead things globally

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,159
irrespective of time

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,880
you know how to deal with priorities um

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
so being able to translate that in to an

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,960
internal process

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,720
it's highly valuable awesome awesome

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,159
yeah i've definitely heard um a lot of

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,799
folks that you know traditionally would

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,640
have

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,039
travel budget set aside and that's kind

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
of been converted to training or l d

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
related activities so it's kind of

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,600
interesting to to hear that that's kind

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,039
of what's happening at least on on the

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,960
comcast side but

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,360
um yeah i know it it's it's a very

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,440
interesting uh state of the world these

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,799
these days so i'll ask one more question

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
before hitting the audience since we

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,000
have a little

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
around 15 i think 10 to 15 minutes left

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
so

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
you know 2020 it's been a wild year uh

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
you know

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
there's tons of things you know have

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,279
been going on in terms of like the ospo

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,120
what's kind of maybe like your favorite

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,039
thing you've you know done or shipped

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
this year that you kind of kind of

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,399
reflect on or or about the ship and kind

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
of would love to

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,760
uh you know to to learn kind of maybe

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,320
what you're

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,760
excited about so any justin or anything

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
anything to share

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,360
in this uh in describe maybe open source

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
a cool new project uh that i should know

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,120
about that would be great especially if

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,200
it's cloud native related

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,320
i think we have two really cool cloud

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,600
native projects

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,799
that i'm very very proud of uh trickster

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,799
which works on the prometheus dashboard

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,320
and accelerates it and then cooper

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,520
healthy

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,480
which is a kubernetes cluster management

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,600
system

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,679
and what surprised us is um how many

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,440
people are using it externally

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,120
you know that's the dream right when you

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
open source something that

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,240
it's actually useful for people and

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,200
people are

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,520
actually using it and we had this

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,520
fantastic blog from adobe

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,360
about cuba healthy saying how much they

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,919
loved it and how much they used it

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,520
and that was really gratifying to see i

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,600
must i must admit

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,440
and then the second positive thing i

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,919
would say is

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
my team has been so resilient and and

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,159
they've been just so

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,200
incredibly positive and productive

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,039
and collaborative and that makes me

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
really happy especially because

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,880
this year's been dreadfully stressful as

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
you said

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,320
and and just one thing after the other

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
right

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,039
and and as a company and as a team we've

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,200
really embraced the year

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,799
and we've spent a lot of time thinking

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,039
about diversity and inclusion we've

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,399
spent a lot of time thinking about

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,679
our country and um you know our company

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,960
and how do we you know be better at uh

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,200
being human beings and so i'm very proud

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,320
of that

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,799
awesome justin anything on your end

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,360
um i mean i get excited about anything

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,399
that moves out um

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,880
and then willing to do it but um i think

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,240
we have

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,919
we have a couple teams that are are

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
trying to do some of the work that

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,519
we've been doing in multi-tenancy in

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,480
kubernetes and kind of the bootstrapping

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,200
of clusters

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
um and do that purely as an open source

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
effort

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,159
so not start it and make it let's say

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,679
overly opinionated

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,919
but start as almost from from uh

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,039
no code all the way up to something

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,919
actionable

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,440
um as an open source work and starting

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,799
to take in feedback

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,559
especially around something that some

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,240
people look at as an anti-pattern

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,640
and really wrestling with some of those

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,760
those problems because that's new to us

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,640
um and so that's exciting to me we're

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,519
also doing a lot of

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,480
accessibility of ai and ml even just

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,799
simple stuff common algorithms

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
wrapping of stuff like pie torch and

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,039
tensorflow

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,799
into more abstractions to hopefully make

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,360
it a little easier to get into

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,480
um i think those are things that we do

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,960
we have to do

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,760
for a lot of our teams but we can make

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,480
those things

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
available to others and and hopefully it

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,720
makes

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,640
other people uh more successful

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
awesome yeah i know every time you could

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
upstream something and work in the open

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,159
i think it's always

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,519
a win and i think back to like nithya's

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,039
point i was trying to think of like you

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,760
know for myself you know i think this

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,600
year

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
you know it's been such a crazy year and

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,200
just like keeping

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
your team together you know people you

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
know employed working

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,919
you know well and then you know kind of

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,279
surviving these times is probably

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,799
you know something that i think we you

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,240
know everyone should be you know proud

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,640
of if they've been fortunate to be able

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,080
to do so because it's just been a

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,720
a a wild year for for folks um so yeah

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
we have about

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
10 minutes left and i'll skip over some

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
of the questions you know we had

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,240
here and then i think uh with this is

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,000
zoom webinar so i think there's q a so

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
we would love to kind of have some uh

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
questions from the audience here before

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,200
there are three questions in the q a

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,720
yeah i'm fine

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
i'm i'm looking at it i'm trying to find

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
here you go sorry about that

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,679
yeah i know i'm trying to see why it's

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,720
not showing up excuse me

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,679
yeah yeah go for it it's uh let me have

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,440
to minimize

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,799
maybe i'll stop sharing my screen and

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,559
that will work oh here you go okay i

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,320
have to stop sharing my screen

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,360
now it's working so

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,960
all right let's go start with um okay

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,560
let's go start with i'll go bottom

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,119
bottom ups so um is the au so uh from uh

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,679
jean george parent is the ospo more like

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,679
a grass

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,520
root push as in something i guess that's

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,280
organized uh organically

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,639
or is it something like a top down

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,359
executive uh

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,679
you know decision um anyone want to take

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,679
uh

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,679
take that one probably differently no

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,440
it's worked both ways for me

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
in in the case of sandisk it was a

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,919
grassroots push where

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,760
i was asking for the company to set it

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,839
up in the case of comcast

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
it was a tops down where the legal team

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
and the executive team

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,560
said hey we need an open source program

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,399
office in the company

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,079
to coordinate everything so i think it

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,399
can be either way

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,599
and we've seen many examples chris of

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,760
both ways

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,720
yeah yeah i think i agree it needs to be

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,879
both

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,760
because if it comes only as a top-down

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,240
effort

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
becomes command and control and often

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,440
the experience of interacting with that

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,480
office may be

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,920
not great um if it's only bottom up

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
then there may not be the executive

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
buy-in which if you're

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
running your legal team at a couple

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,680
hundred dollars an hour

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,720
um that may not they may not be

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,880
tolerated for long so but

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,480
i would start with with your developer

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
anybody who's focused or passionate

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,920
about developer experience

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
because they're going to be that kind of

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,280
middle middle party

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,760
someone who's there to to try to help

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,200
um developers be more productive but

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
also responsible

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,320
for potentially some of the controls or

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,440
processes

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,200
and they can help advocate up the chain

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,480
to say hey this is why software

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,599
composition analysis

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
tooling is important

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,200
cool yeah no it's like it's i think it's

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,480
a mix of how comp

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
you know instructions company i think

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,119
long term successfully most open source

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,280
programs that

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
you know had that mix of kind of ground

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,480
you know support

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,240
with the executive top down funding and

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,240
budget because you know just like any

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,079
organization that owns a p l you always

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
have to kind of you know defend

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,000
find your existence which kpis and okrs

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,440
you work for so hopefully that answer is

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,320
your question

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
uh jean george we have a couple more um

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,520
we'll go next one

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,960
uh if you could go back in time knowing

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,280
what you know now and giving

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
yourself advice before either starting

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,440
an open source

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,040
program uh or joining an existing one

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,520
what would it be

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,320
uh who wants to go uh with this one i i

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,000
have a couple

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,240
uh a couple ideas

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,680
gosh anyone want to go if yeah yeah i

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,119
mean i would say

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,760
for me it's we we have a group that's

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,359
around our tools um our application

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,800
lifecycle management team

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,040
um and i didn't have it as tight

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,400
a connection to them their product

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,200
manager and their

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,800
the kind of visionary and leadership

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,760
which has always been kind of an awkward

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,040
thing because

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,800
if we're going to do scanning if we're

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,079
going to do integration with tools

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,240
i kind of need them so

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,440
if i could go rewind time it would be

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,720
like no

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,320
set up shop in their in their space

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,800
try to make them more successful and

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,440
help them understand why

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,800
this particular domain can really help

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,800
them be more successful with their

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,800
careers

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,400
um anything to out there anithia just

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,119
just that you know it's

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
it's super super important to have

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,160
executive sponsorship support

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,560
uh in your organization for your ospo

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,440
you

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,920
cannot really exist without that because

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
you're

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,839
most of the time you're a cost center

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,560
and you need that support

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,280
uh and i would say also make sure to

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,400
have

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,640
metrics which is a next question

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
and demonstrate the value that you bring

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,200
to the company

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,280
and tie it to the business of the

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,400
company right each business is different

00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,480
tied to the business of the company

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,320
awesome awesome yeah i think you know

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,760
reflecting on on my own time

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,440
you know given that i ran in osbo a long

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,000
time ago a uh

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,359
being under basically managing up is

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
kind of one way to summarize this is

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,320
like understand that you know

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
here are metrics that you want to hold

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,200
yourself accountable that align with

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,280
some you know business needs

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,880
and then make that well known to your

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
leadership and you know whether it's

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,119
like a monthly or quarterly all hands

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
basically build a brand of what your

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,000
open source program is

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,839
internally through either internal

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,040
summits some type of public internal

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,960
blog make sure that

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,320
you maintain that relationship well so

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,560
people understand what you're

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,079
working on and then the other thing is

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,839
really understanding the

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,359
the line of like build versus buy when

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,440
it comes to developing tooling

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,720
uh you know you know 10 years or so ago

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,640
when i was you know working

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,000
you know ospo land or you know however

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,599
long it was go the state

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,280
of tools was pretty bad things have

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,119
drastically improved in the last few

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,720
years so understanding the landscape of

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,280
which tools out there that you could buy

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,599
for

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,880
you know source code you know analysis

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,480
or you know uh

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,079
scanning you know security scanning

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,240
things have improved drastically i think

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,599
for developers so understanding that

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,320
um cool lots of questions coming on uh

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,240
kpis for execs uh do you have a good

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,960
list of kpis for execs generally i say

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,880
yes this is

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,880
like something you should mandatory do

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,880
but nifty or justin do you maintain kind

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,400
of a list of okrs or kprs

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,400
i i think there was another question

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,119
from holger streidl um

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
which is also an anonymous attendee he's

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,040
been waiting for

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,560
quite some time on that answer yeah so

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,400
it which is actually the same as the

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,320
next one um

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,920
as we all said it's super super

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,400
important to communicate the value of

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,920
your

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,599
um hospital i would say we measure

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,040
things like how many external

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,960
contributions did we make

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,640
to which projects should we make you

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,520
know who are the top contributors from

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,119
the company

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,200
and then we also look at the health of

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,800
our projects that we've open sourced uh

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,720
are they trending correctly

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,760
you know are people getting involved are

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,000
we is the cadence of those projects good

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,440
we look at the health of the incoming

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,119
projects as well

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,359
and then you know it's really really

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,480
difficult to kind of tie

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,880
what we do to how it made a difference

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,560
to the bottom line or the top line

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,200
um so it's it's it's a hard one but

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,560
i'm trying to measure uh how much money

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,440
did we save the company

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,119
if we say chose open source instead of a

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,560
commercial product right

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,839
um and uh how do we

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,079
make developers happier so through enps

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,880
and you know things of that sort so i

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,040
would say

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,800
oscar effectiveness i'll be making an

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,560
impact in the community

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,960
and then i'll be saving the company

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,000
money etc

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,960
awesome anything to add there justin uh

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,599
two easy ads um one is doing stuff like

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,920
this

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
are you talking at events being kind of

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,319
out there and talking about the

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,400
community talking about the austin new

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,839
york is doing um

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,240
so there's a space for that and then

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,640
working groups sigs a lot of the

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,800
foundations or the larger projects

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,839
have these little ecosystems in there

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,520
and so you can start giving

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:12,000
some currency to being a sig lead

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,800
or working within there in a formal

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
basis

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,880
and then actually have time dedicated to

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,319
it so you kind of build into reward

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,440
mechanisms

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,920
that helps with open source

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,720
sustainability but also helps with your

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,480
corporate brand and personal brand

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,160
awesome well given that we have a few

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,319
minutes we have two more questions

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,240
uh from debra for training do you hire

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,079
external trainers or at all

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
or all of it is in-house for your kind

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,480
of open source

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,040
uh training go ahead um

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,359
mostly in-house but you know there are

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,720
so many fantastic events

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,599
and uh organizations that we all attend

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
uh to do group and open source summit

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,440
and

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,200
and uh all things open et cetera so we

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,760
benefit a lot from attending these

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,680
events and put the hallway track as well

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,319
as attending presentations

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,800
and then we do some training in-house i

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,480
know

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:10,000
com organizations like brandeis

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,640
and rit etc are trying to start

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,839
more training programs um that are

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
cross-functional

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,200
legal and you know community and things

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,079
of that nature

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,280
so we haven't started partaking of that

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,079
training yet

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,040
um we basically either create it

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,480
in-house or

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,560
we get it from an event

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,079
yeah i would say like neutral neutral

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,319
information you can go to places you can

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,560
go to the linux foundation hey chris

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,000
um so there's a lot of those kind of

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,640
both i would say almost boilerplate

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,079
things

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,760
but at some point you're going to run

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,720
into your kind of organizational

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,319
priorities

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,839
that need to be part of your training

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,680
regimen so

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,200
i kind of think about like the 80 20.

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,319
like

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,920
use neutral neutral places uh

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,280
pluralsight udemy

00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,079
phone blank any of those systems

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,280
that have uh certified training kind of

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,319
a common training

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,319
because that builds kind of a

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,920
commonality as you're bringing in

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,839
associates and as your associates are

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,000
going to other opportunities
