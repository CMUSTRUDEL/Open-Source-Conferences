Abstract: This year, ATO will host an interactive panel discussion with TODO Group Members to share their responses to a recent survey conducted in partnership with the Linux Foundation. The survey identified the most important and pressing issues for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) around the world. 

Attendees should leave with a much better understanding of OSPOs in general, a better understanding of OSPO best practices, and a better understanding of OSPO related issues being experienced across the globe.
