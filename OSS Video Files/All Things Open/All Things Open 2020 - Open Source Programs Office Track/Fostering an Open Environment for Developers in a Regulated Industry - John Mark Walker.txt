Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: With the institutional advantage of navigating a public-cloud migration in a highly-regulated industry, Capital One has created an innovative, low-friction environment for developers. John Mark Walker will discuss how Capital One accelerated its cloud-first vision while balancing developersâ€™ open source needs with regulatory requirements. Learn how to determine which software projects to launch; how to connect it with your overarching technology strategy; actively participate in open source communities; and foster partnerships with foundations, all while meeting regulatory requirements.

thank you so much

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,960
welcome everybody good morning good

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
afternoon good evening wherever you may

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
be

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
my name is denmark walker and i uh i run

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
the open source program office

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,640
at capital one and we have a really

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
amazing story to tell

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,720
um about modernization of technology and

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
specifically how we went about looking

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,560
at

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,439
open source and cloud and agile and

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
devops and

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,719
all the things that you know everyone

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
else associates with

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,040
modernization of technology but in our

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
case we had a very

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,200
uh special i guess additional

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,200
complication uh in that you know we are

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
in a highly regulated industry and so

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,760
the question is

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,120
you know how did we as capital one forge

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,199
a path forward

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,480
through all these things while also

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
maintaining

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
uh you know compliance with the

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
regulatory requirements that we have

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
how did we address risk how did we

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,760
formulate a program that let us

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,119
look at these things through the lens of

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
risk management

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
and how did we you know come together

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
and do the things that we

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,280
need to do um it's a it's a great story

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
it's a story about how we looked ahead

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
to the future some years ago and we said

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,320
you know what if we're going to meet the

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,920
requirements of remain competitive

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
we're going to need to be open source

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,119
we're going to need to be cloud first

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,119
we're going to need to adopt

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
new methodologies of collaboration to

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,000
enable the and sustain the innovation

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
that we need

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
to move forward and so all these things

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,759
coalesced

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,479
and came about and we made some missteps

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,320
along the way

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,720
um but by and large uh by learning

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
and taking feedback and figuring out the

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,560
best way forward

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
we've created an environment that allows

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
our engineers to participate

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
in open source communities and we're

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,799
able to have

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,360
what i consider to be a very

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,000
forward-looking

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
and forward-thinking organization around

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
technology

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
and the technology is important don't

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
get me wrong but

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,319
to me the most interesting aspect of

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,120
this is not the technology per se

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,959
it's the culture it's it's how we

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
enabled collaboration it's the

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
the processes that we adopted to be able

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
to adapt to the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,440
needed change it's how we forged

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,840
relationships with our partners and risk

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,840
and different cyber security groups uh

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
to be able to enable what we needed to

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
do

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
if you had the fortune of attending uh

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
a talk yesterday from noreen de souza

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,440
and tyler bell

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
they walked you through the partnerships

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
that we needed to build and their i

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
think their talk was titled um

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
partners in open source the the friends

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
you didn't know you have

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
if you have a chance you should

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
definitely go back and look at that what

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,319
i want to walk through today is

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
uh in some ways similar to that but

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,640
really focusing on

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,440
what are the what's the overarching uh

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,760
uh

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,879
narrative that that we can talk about

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
and how do we

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,800
how do we look at risk in a way that

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,920
allows us to progress

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
and frankly you know i think we need to

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
talk about

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,000
risk management and open source in a way

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,080
that enables

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
companies like capital one to be more

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
collaborative because when you look at

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,159
the entirety of risk when you look at

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,360
open source participation through a risk

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
management lens

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
you come to the conclusion that open

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,000
source participation

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,319
is a means to mitigate and reduce risk

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
um and that's that's exactly the the

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,760
path that

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,080
i chose and it's why uh it's one of the

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,040
primary reasons i came to capital one

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,319
i joined over a year ago and i've i've

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
been in open source communities my

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,400
entire

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,239
working life for the most part um and it

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
intrigued me a capital one story

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
intrigued me and it was um

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
enticing to me to be a part of that and

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
to help

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
push it along even further um so as we

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,599
as we walk through

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
you know our journey and and the lessons

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,799
learned

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
um understand that everything we're

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,840
doing with respect to open source and

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,959
cloud

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,840
is about maximizing the innovation

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,319
and productivity while reducing risk and

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,040
some of the things that we've done

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,120
may not look like things that mitigate

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,239
risk but i will point out how they are

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
because i want

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,720
everyone to take away from this uh key

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
steps that you can take

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
to uh to make sure that you know your

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
organizations

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
are well managed round open source and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
cloud and that you have the tools that

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
you need

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
uh to succeed so without further ado let

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
me um

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,400
let me go a step further and talk about

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
how

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
when you look at technology

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,080
modernization and you look at the usage

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
of

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,479
open source software there's a lot of

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,759
you have to take a holistic approach you

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
have to think about

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
where does your software come from who

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,560
produced it

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
what is the state of its production

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
what's the state of the community

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
that produced it and so you're seeing a

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,479
heavy emphasis

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
from a lot of large enterprises on you

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
know

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
scanning how do we how do we make sure

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,960
that we understand what's inside the

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
software

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,960
what risks we're taking on and all about

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
how do you initiate or instantiate

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
policies

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
that help you govern the usage of open

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
source and how do you protect the supply

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
chain and how do you

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,479
how do you construct a bill of material

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
so that you know

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
you know everything that's running and

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,560
so all these things come into play

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
because

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
you know most organizations by this

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
point have

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
come to understand the benefits of using

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
open source it's not

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
i don't think that's an argument for

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,919
today that argument was 15 20 years ago

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
the argument now is

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,160
how do you use it in a well-managed way

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
how do you get the most benefit from it

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,400
and how do you make sure that you know

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
you're not introducing new risks and how

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840
do you look at it through the lens of

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
risk management

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
and to that point you know the previous

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,360
slide was about a gartner study

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
and this one references a forester a

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
study

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
this one focuses on cloud container

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,039
adoption in the enterprise but really

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,639
you could look at container adoption and

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,039
use the same description that you see

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
here

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,800
around compliance and apply it to any

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
kind of new

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,039
disruptive technology that is at the

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,039
beginning of its adoption curve

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
or we're still rising in this adoption

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,440
curve um

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,600
and you can see here according to the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
forester report compliance is the number

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,440
one concern among senior tech leaders

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
using container management platforms

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
and this really comes down to you know

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
how do you

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
um how do you use these new technologies

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,280
how do you adopt them

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
uh through the lens of risk management

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,199
and make sure that

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
you know you're um you're on point uh in

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,360
your usage of

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,960
your governance for these new

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
technologies is sound

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
and that's what we're really going to

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,840
walk through today is like

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
you know adopting these new new

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,720
technologies and processes

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
while at the same time ensuring that we

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,880
can sustain our innovation

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,479
um going forward

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,720
this gives you an idea of the impact of

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,720
open source on the enterprise and this

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
is a result of a

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
2019 lux foundation survey i think there

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
is actually a 2020 version of the survey

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,199
which shows

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
uh comparable results but the the

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
takeaway here is that

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,639
organizations that have made these

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
cultural changes organizations that

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,560
have you know bought in to open source

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,599
collaboration and use open source

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,479
software

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
extensively these are the companies

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
these are the enterprises that that move

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
fast these are the ones that

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
deploy software more frequently these

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,120
are the ones that have adopted

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,319
devops principles more wholeheartedly

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,400
it once you adopt an open source mindset

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,680
it leads you down the path of other

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
things including

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
cloud and devops and other things we

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
associate with software modernization i

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
think

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,879
open source goes hand in hand with all

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
those things as they kind of coalesce

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
together

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
and so you know you can use open source

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
in the same way that you used

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,879
uh traditional off-the-shelf software

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,120
but the

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
question is why would you do that

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
because

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,000
with the by embracing open source

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,000
collaboration and by embracing open

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
source platforms and libraries and

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,280
tooling

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,479
it enables you a level of flexibility

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,960
that you didn't have

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,160
before and so once you get used to that

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
convenience i think

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
stephen o'grady likes to refer to the

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,719
convenience of open source and how that

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
um that fall flows into the convenience

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,200
of

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
you know a cloud-first mindset and the

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
convenience of

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,599
you know having a devops having adopted

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
devops principles it all sort of flows

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
together and you can see that

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
i'm encapsulated in these diagrams and

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
charts

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
that sort of show you exactly what a

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,839
difference

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,839
adopting that mindset makes

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
so let's let's take a little path let's

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,160
take a little walk through the the

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,600
history of capital one's modernization

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,200
story because

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
as i mentioned it's a it's a very

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,000
compelling story

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,080
um when we started out uh you know

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,279
we were you know we had your traditional

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
monolithic

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,839
set of monolithic apps um and

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,760
i have to give a lot of credit to

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,640
the leadership in our technology

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,920
organization for recognizing that

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,399
that approach was not going to sustain

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,600
us

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,600
going forward we had to make changes

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,920
to adopt new practices new tooling

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
and we really had to enforce some type

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,279
of cultural change to make it possible

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
and at the same time recognizing that we

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
had

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,920
you know regulatory requirements that

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
maybe a lot of other companies

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
don't have and so it adds a complicating

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,600
layer but i think we've shown

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,080
that it is possible once you

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
walk through it and and and do what you

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
need to do but you can see the story

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
that

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
you know you can see the open source

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,200
focus early on

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
where we basically declared a few some

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
some time ago we declared publicly i

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
think it was 2014 2015

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
that we were going to be an open source

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,839
first organization that means that

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,320
we were going to first and foremost

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,320
focus

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,760
on open source tooling and libraries

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,959
that we can use

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,800
within our developer

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,519
process developer lifecycle

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,160
and so by doing so by starting that path

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,440
i think we're now at the point where

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,480
i think the last um survey i saw

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
internally was that some a very large

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
percentage

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,279
of our internally developed applications

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,200
are composed of open source components

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
um i think it's upwards of 90

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
or so and i think that's actually

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,160
comparable to a lot of other enterprises

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
if you look at

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
most of the survey data now it's between

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
80 and 90 percent

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
of code that's deployed and internally

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,160
has an open source

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,240
origin so we're really just in keeping

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
with that same overall trend

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
um but once we started down that path

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
once we started realizing the

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,000
flexibility and the convenience that

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,240
that comes from it we realized that

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,760
you know we're going to start looking at

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,680
you know public cloud because

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,440
again continuing the story of

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,160
convenience flexibility

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
public cloud offers things that you know

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
you simply don't have

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,360
when you manage your own data center and

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,640
in fact i'm happy to report that

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,839
as of last month we exited our last data

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
center we're now

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
all in on public cloud and that was

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
enabled by

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,959
our embrace of open source those things

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
go right hand in hand

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,880
i don't think you can adopt a cloud

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,720
first mentality without first embracing

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
uh the open source software

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,399
uh as the primary composition of your

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,279
applications

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
and then as we move forward we we also

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,959
did a few other things we declared that

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,880
you know we're going to embrace devops

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
principles um we're going to

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,800
you know traditionally or a few years

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
ago we had the same

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,560
methodology as a lot of places where you

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,839
know we had our centralized ops and we

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,480
had the developers and the developers

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,079
would finish developing and then

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
hoof it over the wall and then give it

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,800
to the the ops people but now

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,240
um you know we've by embracing devos

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,320
devops principles

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
i'm happy to report that we have

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
embraced the concept of you build it you

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
own it

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
and so the developers develop but

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
they're also responsible for

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,279
maintaining and monitoring and

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
observability uh

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
going forward and so that's uh that's

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
led to um

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
some massive changes in how we develop

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,000
and maintain software

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,600
we we adopted agile um across

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
most of the organization to the point

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,399
where most development teams at

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,920
capital one now follow agile

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
methodologies

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,440
and then we we also declared that you

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
know we're going to move to a micro

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,760
services model

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,519
and all these things were built out

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
starting with pilot modes and then

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,560
increasing the adoption

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,040
across the organization and

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,680
containers are following a similar path

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
uh

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
as well as you know the micro services

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
model as we've

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
gradually but consistently moved away

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,000
from the monolithic model

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,000
embracing uh the microservices the cloud

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,639
first the open source first

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
agile agile development the devops

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
principles

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,200
these all these things all go hand in

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
hand as we fulfill

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
sort of the ultimate you know

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
modernization of technology

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,320
story and it's it's allowed us to

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,480
sustain the innovation

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,160
that we started the path that we started

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,639
on so many years ago

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
uh and we're able to you know pivot

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,839
quickly you know so

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
as an example when we all had to do our

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
switch to work from home

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
um that the quick pivot was enabled by

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,399
the fact that we adopted

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,920
all these highly flexible

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,600
maximizing convenience processes

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
that allowed us to fulfill that

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,120
obligation with very little disruption

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
across the organization

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,480
and when you're able to embrace these

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,600
things while making sure that you

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
manage it well you're able to to do

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
things like that you're able to be as

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
flexible as possible because you've

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,760
embraced

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,000
the overall convenience and that's kind

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,880
of the the overall story here how do you

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,880
put that into motion

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
so let's talk about the the open source

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
focus because this is

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
this is the the first thing that we we

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,320
started talking about

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,120
uh all those years ago um

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
and it very quickly became apparent once

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
we

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,639
enabled our engineers to start making

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,760
open source contributions i think within

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,600
a year of that

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,079
we recognize the need that the need for

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,040
having a or creating a programmatic

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,320
approach to

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,399
open source and the first thing we

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,279
focused on was usage

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,839
how do we govern the usage of open

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
source

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
across capital one and again this is

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
where the

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
partnerships with our uh with the risk

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,279
and

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,560
and uh cyber security organizations came

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,920
into play because

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,240
when you start using open source the

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,320
first question that's asked is around

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,720
okay what are these licensing things

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,600
what's uh what is the gpl

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
uh what is what uh what obligations do

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,040
we now have

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,839
once we adopt these open source licenses

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
and so

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,079
by pulling in our our legal partners and

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,480
our risk partners we were able to create

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,680
a system of governance around which we

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
could enable

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,519
our developers to use almost exclusively

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
you know open source

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,880
pieces and components to to build their

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
applications but that

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,399
there is an education that went along

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
with that you know we we needed to

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
educate our legal partners we need to

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
educate our risk partners about why this

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,959
is important

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,720
um and to their credit you know they

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
were along for the ride and

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
this is why i always emphasize whenever

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,199
you're talking about

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,880
you know building in organizational

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
change you know

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
developers are great you you need your

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
developers but in order to make this

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
successful in order to

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
unlock maybe some of the roadblocks that

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,720
you're going to find

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,639
you've got to work with your build

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,560
relationships with your risk partners

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,160
and legal partners in order to

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
and educate them so that you can

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,199
actually push these things forward

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,199
that's one of the things i always

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,800
emphasize when i give this talk is

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,240
you know we couldn't have done this

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,639
without developing the relationships

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
that we needed with the non-technical

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,600
areas the

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,199
non-technology areas so that we could

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
actually continue to move forward

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,279
and so by doing that we're able to

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,839
create this environment in which we can

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,720
you know adopt open source first uh and

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,000
then use it

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,720
as the basis for our sdlc

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,519
the next thing was contribution you know

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,480
because

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,279
when you look at open source usage you

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,959
very quickly

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,560
come to a point where you're using a

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,440
bunch of software and it gets

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,040
old and stale and you have a bunch of

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
changes that you want to make

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
and where do you put those changes well

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
the logical place is you

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,079
push it upstream and i'll give a more

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
comprehensive overview of what that

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,279
looks like

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
but for now i understand that this is

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
sort of the

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,240
the phase two you you use open source

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,120
okay how do you enable your

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,199
engineers to um to contribute to these

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,959
open source communities because frankly

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,039
it's in your interest to do that and

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,280
that's the that's the argument that

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
you know we make when we we have these

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,360
partnerships with um

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
with our legal and risk groups uh you

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,039
know contributing software

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,200
back to the communities that you know

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,240
we're involved in or depend on

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
um is a key component of having

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,880
an open source first mindset so it's all

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
about taking those same partners

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,120
and continuing the evolution as you as

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,520
you build uh this infrastructure

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
um that you need and then then the the

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
next thing was

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,000
and you'll see examples of this later on

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
this talk

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
where we realized that you know we've

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
got a lot of smart engineers

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,120
we've got we've learned a lot of lessons

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,760
from our um

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,480
progress in you know cloud first and

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,600
open source

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,320
first modernization

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,480
how do we put this how do we take these

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
lessons learned and put them in a way

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,440
that

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,799
others can learn from them and so i'm

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
always a fan of

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,440
you know show don't tell although in

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
this presentation i am telling so

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
uh but the show don't tell aspect of

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
this is in

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
launching new open source projects and

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,799
it was actually within

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,280
i think a year or two of our open source

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,520
first

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,320
declaration that we started putting

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
together

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,240
the pieces that we needed to to launch

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,919
new open source projects

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,520
and i'm happy to report some new

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,840
development in this area but

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
uh for now just know that uh you know

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,120
that that resulted in

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,640
projects like hygiena which is a devops

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
dashboard and a cloud custodian which

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
allows

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,559
allows you to institute um policies that

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,160
you know controls for your cloud assets

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,440
but we recognize that this was the next

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
phase of the evolution that in order to

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
be

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
again in order to have a comprehensive

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,919
open source first organization

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,280
we needed an outlet for our engineers to

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,880
put what they've learned

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
into these open source projects that we

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,840
can then develop collaboratively

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,960
and learn even more from the process as

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,679
well as we you know

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
as well as put the the software through

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
you know

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
run it through the gauntlet of other

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
people's enterprises so that

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,120
you know it improves the the performance

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,960
of the software um

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,799
and then we you know along the way we

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
have a couple of other pieces of the the

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,559
story that

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
helped to fill in the rest of it um you

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
know when you're going to use open

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,400
source you're going to contribute open

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,960
source and you're going to

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
launch new open source projects along

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,160
the way you're building in these

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,080
collaborative processes you're

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,200
recognizing um the gains to be made by

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,640
consolidating on certain platforms uh

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
by developing you know consistent

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
interfaces by

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
having you know breaking silos and one

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,480
of the large devops

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
principles is around um the primary

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
devops

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,480
principles is around you know breaking

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
down silos and

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
by adopting these practices you're

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
you're you're incorporating what's known

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
as

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
inner source um where all these

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,960
communities you're enabling

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
collaboration

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
between teams between departments uh

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,039
which allows things to

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
go faster and sustain the innovation

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,480
that you need um

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
you know going forward and then the last

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,559
piece of this is

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,919
around you know the final piece of the

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,400
the evolution the final piece of the

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
puzzle

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,720
is around how we relate to

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,159
and work with these upstream communities

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,679
that we depend on

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,600
again the same thing as with

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
contribution and sponsorship or

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
launching new projects

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,880
is how do we work with

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,000
uh these communities and foundations

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,520
that that we rely on that produce the

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,559
software that we use in

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,840
say 90 of our applications and so

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
there's a i guess there's a an

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
obligation responsibility on our part to

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,400
make sure

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,039
uh that these organizations are

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,039
sustainable um for the long term

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,720
um again this is where we get to the

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,880
reduction of risk or viewing things

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,679
through a risk mitigation lens

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,320
by doing so you emphasize the importance

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
of

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,640
working hand in hand with these outside

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
groups

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,360
so this is an overview of you know what

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,039
i would call a comprehensive

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,799
open source program office and and

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,480
whenever i talk to the companies about

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,640
what they're doing with open source

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
i always talk about you know looking at

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,039
every angle of it and not just

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
usage it's very easy to get locked into

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,120
a point of view that

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
the open source program is really about

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
managing

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,000
license compatibility or compliance and

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,520
security vulnerabilities and that's true

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
and those are very important

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,200
but you need to understand the

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,320
prominence of

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,880
of those of either security issues or

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760
license compliance issues and how do you

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
actually

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,799
work with the upstream communities to

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,280
prevent them from happening in the first

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,520
place which leads me to

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,280
the the overall you know comprehensive

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
view of our supply chain

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,360
one of the one of the things i always

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,600
recommend that companies

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
look at when they're thinking of

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,400
buttressing

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
or coming out with a new open source

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,679
program is to

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
look at the totality of software they

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,679
depend on and

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,000
like many companies you know once we go

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,000
through the exercise of looking at

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
what are the foundational pieces of the

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
software we're building

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
again we we find that it's a very high

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
percentage

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,080
of code uh that comes from you know

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
beyond

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,559
our organization you know outside of

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,080
these four walls it comes from these

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,400
upstream communities and

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
the reason i like to look at the supply

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
chain funnel

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,799
as a model and a diagram to to think

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
about these things is that

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,720
it speaks to a couple of things it

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,520
speaks to the importance

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,200
of the provenance of the of the open

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,799
source components that you use as the

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
building blocks

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,799
but also shows you how you uh

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
that flows into your overall product

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,000
management

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
but the other thing it shows you is that

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,880
implied in the supply chain funnel

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,960
is that there needs to be a

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,960
a system or at least a a

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,159
a process of that enforces

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,240
bi-directionality

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
it's not just that you're using these

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
components of open source to to build

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,080
software

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,280
it's that because you're relying on them

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,000
there needs to be a

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
bi-directionality between the uh the

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,159
software components used to build

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,520
and the the developer platforms that

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,000
they flow into

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,200
um without that bi-directionality you're

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,880
basically

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,559
building in uh excessive technical debt

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
because you're you're maintaining these

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,720
things over time

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,480
by enforcing in bi-directionality and by

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
looking and by incorporating this model

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
into your

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,600
you know software development life cycle

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,600
overview or the you know the seven stage

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,720
or how many stages you have in your sdlc

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
diagrams

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
by overlaying these two things you're

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,919
able to incorporate it into your overall

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
development model

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
and that way you can bake in the idea

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
that hey

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,279
we need to contribute these fixes back

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
in order to get these sort of

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,039
comprehensive healthy supply chain that

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,320
we need

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,880
to sustain what we're doing one of the

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,360
one of the key pieces of this that i

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,919
like to

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
focus on are not not just the components

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,039
um

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,559
from the upstream uh communities but

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,600
that middle layer that developer

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,320
platform

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,559
uh it has some unique characteristics

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,960
that can make the difference between

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,200
you know success or failure for your um

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,919
your open source projects because once

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,880
once you get um so once you incorporate

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,320
all these different open source

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,919
components into your

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
perspective build environments or

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,480
application development

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
you end up with a uh about midway

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
through

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,960
you end up with a a set of a platform

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,760
or a set of tools that are mature enough

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,480
to attract

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
developers um you know not quite a

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,840
finished product but

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
but the thing that developers can rely

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,440
on to build on

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
and that's why this becomes kind of a

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,840
center of gravity

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
for everything else that um that you

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,480
build

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,080
it's it's it's not quite a finished

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,320
product but it's the thing that

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
you can use to build community you can

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,480
build collaboration

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
uh and by by having these application

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,919
developers

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,880
work on you know the uh the developer

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,320
platforms

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,159
it can become a a force multiplier uh in

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,600
your community building uh

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,760
efforts and your and your development

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,159
efforts um by

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
by making these developer platforms

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,720
accessible

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
to more people you're able to

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,360
incorporate more feedback

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,960
as you continue to develop the platform

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
before it's released

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
but you're also able to make sure that

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,799
you have a relatively stable platform

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
that developers can build their apps

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,760
with reasonable assurance that it will

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,520
continue to work

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,440
even when it moves into the the

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,480
so-called the finished product stage

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
we all know that there is no such thing

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,799
as a finished product right but um but

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
there are

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,480
products that are ready for release and

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,320
so you need to both

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
incorporate feedback from app developers

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,279
as well as make sure that you have

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,520
stable apis that you can use

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
that they can that are reliable and that

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,000
continue to work

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,840
as they go into the release product

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
because again this is where we enforce

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,880
the bi-directionality the finished

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,080
product is not a finished product

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,240
um you're going to continue to relay

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,320
feedback from the finished product into

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,440
the developer platform so again at every

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,960
stage of this

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,720
you've got the bi-directional

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,919
bi-directionality built in

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,720
and you're able to have a

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,159
well-maintained supply chain

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
for your development efforts that you

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,840
can sustain the effort over time

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,320
i came across this idea

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,440
after talking with a friend from who

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,200
works in the um

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,480
he works in intel supply chain group and

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
at the time i was an open source

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,919
community manager and he told me

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,400
i figured out what it is that you do and

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,760
i said

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,919
great why don't you tell me and he said

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,880
you're the guy at the top of the funnel

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,240
and i said

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
i don't know what that means explain it

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
to me and he went through how

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,600
you know they when they when they piece

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,919
when they source um

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,720
parts for different things they build at

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,480
intel

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,679
they talk about being at the at the top

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,039
of the funnel or the beginning of the

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
supply chain funnel

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
and then tracking its progress as it

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,799
makes its way

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,840
through until they get to the end stage

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,360
and i thought

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
that's a brilliant way of describing

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,200
what i do because yes i am the person

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,039
uh at the beginning of the funnel that's

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,039
the part that i like to talk about

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,320
but once i started thinking about it i

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,159
realized that

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,679
when you're tracking progress and open

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,720
source software it's a it's a

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,640
different uh metaphor than say you know

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
what you'd use for a hardware

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,559
product tracking purpose because open

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,559
source software you're again you're

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,039
building in the feedback mechanisms

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,559
getting these feedback loops uh to

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,159
maximum effect

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,320
and then that's when i came upon the

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,760
idea that you know this middle tier is

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,600
actually pretty interesting from a

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,480
software development point of view

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,600
and you can look at so many open source

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,000
ecosystems that function this way from

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,039
you know kubernetes or kubernetes is

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,399
that middle tier

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,760
the upstream components that make up

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
kubernetes and then at the end you've

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
got

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,880
all these different distributions built

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
on kubernetes um it can you can

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
use linux where you've got different

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,159
community

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,840
distributions of linux those are the the

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,399
places that attract developers and then

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,960
you've got

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,159
end products based on those so it it

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,880
helps to inform

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,679
and it applies equally well to products

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
that you build

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,919
internally not just externally um so if

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,919
you're creating

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,360
software and you're releasing it for

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,520
customers internally

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,279
i find this to be a useful way to look

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,000
at your process

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,039
and to look at your sdlc governing

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,679
principles

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,200
as a way to to maximize you know the the

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,720
open source collaborative

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
aspects of it so

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,399
and so as such um you know i mentioned

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,679
that

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,039
you know when you look at the supply

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,799
chain funnel and you and you look at

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,840
that diagram to guide

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,799
uh your thinking you you immediately

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,399
you're struck by

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,399
the importance of relying on all these

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,600
externally developed

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,880
software components uh and once you look

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,159
at that and realize that you're

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,480
dependent on

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,840
you know 90 of your code coming from

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,880
these places

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,720
you begin to put into place the

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,880
processes that ensure

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,559
that these communities and foundations

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,960
are sustainable over time so

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,120
as part of that we have become you know

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
members of a number of foundations and

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,039
communities

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,600
across the open source landscape um

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,520
the the cncf is important to us because

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,480
one we use a lot of the software that

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,520
uh is under the governance of the cncf

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,559
uh but we also

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,559
um contributed a project to the cncf

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,919
it's cloud custodian i'll get into that

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,240
in a minute um

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
you know the to do group is a is a great

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,159
um organization

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,640
dedicated to you know governance of open

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
source

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,919
at internally companies especially if

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
you're part of an open source program

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,320
office

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,919
and so it's important to us to know what

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,799
are the best processes that we can have

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,440
in place

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,279
um the apache software foundation we uh

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,480
we depend on a lot of the software that

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,919
comes from there so again

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,159
it's important to us that the asf

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,159
is sustainable and that we are you know

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,200
good members of

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,720
of its body um the linux foundation um

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,480
has so much influence uh and it governs

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,960
so many different projects that

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,320
in order for us to be you know good

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
upstanding members of open source

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,399
communities it's important that the

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,159
linux foundation

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,320
is sustainable as well and the same

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,399
thing for the python software foundation

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
uh the the fintech open source

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,080
foundation also called phenos

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
and then we have the um the continuous

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,640
delivery foundation because we are

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,840
we are an end user of continuous

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
delivery tools

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,000
um we we incorporate these tools

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,399
throughout our sdlc process

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
um we we rely on a lot of the tools that

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,840
are under their governance

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,519
and so it just makes a lot of sense you

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,159
know as an end user

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,279
of these tools to make sure that we are

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,720
good members

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,200
of this organization and i'm happy to

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,799
report that we've actually taken a lead

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,039
role in helping to build out

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,399
an end user community as part of the cdf

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,480
which i hope to

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,440
be able to talk to too many of you about

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
later on but

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,399
um but in in

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,919
in summary the point of this is

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,000
we are dependent on these things in

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,080
order to mitigate our risk

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
from depending on these things we have

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,519
an interest in making sure that they're

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,600
sustainable and that's this is us

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,480
you know fulfilling that interest and

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
and doing our part

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,600
so we went to the the open source you

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,399
know the open source first

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,960
part and in continuation of that and

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
really

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,640
hand in hand with that we have the the

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,640
part where we start to

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
to build out our cloud infrastructure

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,840
our tooling our platforms

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,559
um and again it goes hand in hand with

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
open source

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,640
it's once you realize the flexible

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,679
inconvenience of adopting open source

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,720
principles

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,720
you go right into hey how can we

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,840
maximize this and make better use of it

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,480
and i think

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,200
again around 2015 uh around that time

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,120
frame

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,840
uh we declared that we were going to

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,240
we're going to go all in on public cloud

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,279
and it caused quite a stir at the time

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,120
um and uh again as i mentioned before

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,279
i'm happy to report that

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,559
we actually closed out um our last data

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,000
center as of last

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,080
month and i think we made a big

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,559
announcement around that so

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,120
it has come to fruition and we've you

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,480
know

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,559
one thing i've learned being here is

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,080
that we talk about big things and big

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,120
ideas and then we actually make it

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,039
happen and that's a

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,720
that's a pretty cool thing that um i'm

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,679
proud to be a part of

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,320
um because once you once you realize

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,799
this

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,080
you know cloud cloud-first mentality um

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,399
and then to adopt

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,399
uh simultaneously the devops principles

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,840
and and incorporate that you build that

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,279
you own it mindset

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,440
um you get this after effect of

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,200
reducing duplicative efforts and making

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,799
sure that

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,960
developers are more on point and that

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,279
they're while they're developing within

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,200
the

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,320
proper guard rails and processes that

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
we've implemented

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,000
they're also breaking down silos and

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,679
working more collaboratively

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,240
and consolidating their efforts around a

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,159
few core platforms that help us to uh

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,679
to move forward faster and that's

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,480
ultimately what it's what it's about

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,799
allowing that

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
building that convenience into you know

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,559
our systems and processes

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,000
so that developers naturally migrate to

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
it and they see the immediate immediate

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,159
benefit

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,039
that's probably the the main thing and

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,080
that again all that was enabled because

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,360
we established these partnerships

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,200
with our you know risk groups and legal

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,279
groups and cyber security groups

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,220
and able to make this happen so it could

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,430
become a reality

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,430
[Music]

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,919
and along the way we learned a lot of

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,679
things from

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,279
what we've done you know in the open

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,079
source arena

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,919
through our efforts to incorporate you

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,440
know devops principles and

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,520
agile methodologies we we ended up

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
taking what we learned and applying it

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,760
in our

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,000
hijia project which we launched as

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,440
our you know devops dashboard so you

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
could visualize the health of your you

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,960
know ci cd pipeline

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,399
and we got some really good adoption

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,599
from that

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,800
in similar uh in similar ways

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,440
when we made our first four rays into

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,720
you know public cloud infrastructure we

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
realized that we needed to

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,200
build out the configurations and

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,399
processes to govern

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,240
you know the assets that we're putting

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,000
in the cloud and we took what we learned

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,560
and we released the open source project

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,599
cloud custodian and cloud custodian uh

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,159
has had

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
an incredible adoption path um frankly

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,880
it became too big for

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,760
capital one um to the point now where

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
you know we've contributed to the cncf

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,760
where it is a

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,320
sandbox project and we're we're we've

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,960
just been

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
um really happy with the overall growth

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
of the project and

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,560
the adoption uh of the project because

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,240
it it helps other companies

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,480
you know learn from what we've we've

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,760
learned and to adopt the similar

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
principles when they're

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,520
you know when they're building out their

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,760
their cloud infrastructure so it's a

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,040
it's a great you know advancement for

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
different open source communities

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,640
they're looking to do

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,599
similar things but the overall takeaway

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,359
here is that

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,880
you know we take what we've learned and

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,359
then we put it into

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,960
open source projects uh it's it's kind

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,920
of a thing that we do here

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,200
and so as a continuation of that when

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,119
you look at

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
what we've been able to do from a micro

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,440
services and

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,000
container management point of view it's

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,119
again a similar story we're we're

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,680
putting together

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,000
processes and technology platforms we're

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,720
putting in a place to enable

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and sustain innovation in this area

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
going forward

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,160
and so that allows us to adopt some

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,760
technologies that we've used to build

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,760
out for this

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
and we're taking what we've learned and

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
uh you know

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,560
we've kind of made the first steps

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,079
towards um

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,079
putting this out there and you're going

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,280
to see some of that

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,320
take the form of which is our

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,800
it's a command line tool for

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
bootstrapping kubernetes clusters um

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,480
so this is our for the first

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,320
representation of

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,520
you know things that we've open sourced

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,960
ever as a result

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,960
of you know what we've been able to

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,400
build out from a container

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,480
infrastructure and management

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,960
uh standpoint and uh uh you know

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
can't i won't promise anything but uh

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,560
you can see the

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,480
uh you know the the standard and they uh

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,520
that we've established over time

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
um so this is this is a good first

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
effort for us

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,880
and uh very much looking forward to your

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,560
feedback on this we were

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,640
i think we had a bit of a pause between

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,079
open source projects that we released

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,280
but this was actually

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,800
made public i think three weeks ago

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,320
and we're looking forward to getting

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
feedback on it and

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,760
you know viewing this as a continuation

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,320
of the story

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
you know we went from open source to

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,160
cloud

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,680
to agile and devops and along the way

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,359
building out these micro services

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,160
platforms and adopting container

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,640
management

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,000
tooling and practices and you're seeing

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
that you know reflected

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,200
uh in this this project that we just

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,119
released

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,480
so i pretty much look forward to to

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,400
hearing uh

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,160
you know how it how it works for you and

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,880
whether or not it works well for you

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,800
um but again this is this is the the

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,160
part of the the continuing story

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,760
um we set out to do very big things and

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,160
we've we've been able to do them we

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,920
learned a few hard lessons along the way

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,920
but they're they're useful lessons and

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
they're things that you know i'm hoping

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,680
that

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,720
you can also um take away and apply to

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,119
your organization

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,760
but the main things to emphasize here

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,560
are

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,359
you know the key part of being an open

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,160
source

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,800
first organization is you have to be

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,720
active

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,079
in the open source communities that you

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,680
depend on

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,760
again 90 of your code comes from outside

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,119
of the four walls of your organization

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,400
how do you maintain it going forward or

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,960
i guess how do you adopt a risk-based

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,880
lens

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,240
so that you understand that mitigating

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
risk means

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,920
working with these upstream communities

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,680
so that you're not just dependent on

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,240
what they produce but you can actually

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,079
actively engage in what they produce and

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,599
control your supply chain

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,040
again if you look at the supply chain

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,119
model you're dependent on all these

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,079
things so it's it's in your interest to

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,440
make sure that

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,160
they're the highest quality that they

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,599
can be before they ever enter into your

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,240
production process um and so by being

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,800
involved

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,839
upstream you're increasing the quality

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
and you're basically

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,560
reducing the level of effort required uh

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,839
to bring them up to speed once they do

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,680
land you know behind your firewall um

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,359
the other thing is you know this gets to

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,240
the the point around

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,320
you know fixing bugs and you know making

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,520
sure that you know you don't you can to

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,920
uh

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,359
to to harden the software and your

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,640
application will be more secure when you

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,520
can share it with experts

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,480
um it's certainly resulted in better

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,200
software

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,400
uh you know in in the form of hygiena

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,839
and cloud custodian

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,599
and i'm hoping the same thing follows

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,359
suit with crits

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,640
but once you share your code out there

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,680
once you put it out there it does a

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,359
couple things

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,680
i mean first of all you have to make

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,320
sure that it's generally usable you

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,560
can't just

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,000
create it you just you can't just open

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,839
source a bespoke solution

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,680
that works specifically for an

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,440
individual use case you have to make it

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,680
general purpose enough

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,040
so that enough people can adopt it and

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,440
use it for their own and so it

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
it forces the developer to adopt this

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,800
mindset of creating software for general

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,880
usage which

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
when you think about it also results in

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,000
overall quality

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,680
and increasing quality for the software

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,640
itself even if it's just for internal

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,800
usage

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,000
just because it's going to be more

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,200
generally usable and

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,880
can adapt to changing environments more

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,680
readily so it becomes more flexible

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
overall

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,359
but beyond that just having more

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,400
people look at it incorporating it

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,560
adopting it

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,599
maybe even contributing fixes that's

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,680
going to help

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,520
increase the quality of the software as

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
well and so you get this community

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,440
dynamic

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,280
you you maximize these feedback loops

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,000
and have mechanisms for

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,319
you know other people other developers

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,119
and

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,880
companies to influence the roadmap it

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
results in a better experience overall

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,680
and

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,160
and that's something that we've embraced

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,480
and and can tell a good story around

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,760
and then finally you know once you adopt

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,960
this holistic model

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,839
once you once you understand that your

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
sdlc

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,560
program extends far beyond your

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,160
organization and that you need to look

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,000
upstream and look at the source of where

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,119
these things come from

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,480
it definitely influences your view

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,839
of risk management and how um

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,520
incorporating that view help gives you

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,240
the um the it gives you the imperative

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,040
to make sure that your supply chain can

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,680
sustain

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,240
what you need to do um technology wise

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,560
and it's

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,160
that's probably the the biggest thing

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,560
that i like to emphasize when

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
when looking to adopt open source

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,200
programs is

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,960
are you looking at your software

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,480
development life cycle holistically and

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,920
comprehensively

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,480
and how does that influence your

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,359
decisions to release software contribute

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,359
software

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,280
and make sure that the communities that

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,800
you depend on are sustainable

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
so those are the those are the main

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,240
takeaways and i think

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,960
with that i think we have five minutes

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,960
for questions

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,040
and i want to look at

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,400
if you have questions i guess um

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,480
feel free to ask them i have five

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,760
minutes

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,440
ah so i have a question so this is

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,040
accomplished over how many years i think

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,280
if you look at the first

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,480
public declarations around being open

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,119
source first

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,319
being cloud first i'm going to say and

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,079
these are public decorations

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,440
declaration so i'm not going to get in

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,480
trouble for seeing them but

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,520
i'm thinking it's in the 2014-2015 time

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,000
frame when we

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,720
when we really went public with uh what

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,520
we were

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,079
going to do here so it's been a journey

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,920
um

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,280
but we we had some immediate success

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,440
with it and that's the thing like

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,280
that immediate success fueled the

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,800
continuation of it so we

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,280
once we went down that path you know we

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,119
recognized that

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,880
it's the right thing to do and so that's

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,119
we've just we've just followed through

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,119
um as we go on um

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,040
all right any other uh any other

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,400
questions before

00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:01,680
before we uh before we drop um

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,240
okay well it's i always love to

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,760
to tell the story i always love to um

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,560
walk through it with uh

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,359
with people and i cannot see the q and a

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,440
uh

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,960
can someone read me what says in the q a

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,400
so i understand what questions are being

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,400
asked

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,760
sure um here's a question from gordon

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,880
huffs that says what

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,920
are your main challenges today the main

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,079
challenges today

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,480
are how do we you know when i was um

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,520
when i joined capital one it was a for a

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,079
very specific reason

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,200
there were two specific reasons one is

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,119
how does a company like

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,720
capital one uh behave in such a

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,880
forward-thinking manner

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,839
given where it is and the second reason

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,640
i joined was

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,079
you know over my years in different open

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,400
source communities

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,440
i noticed that a lot of large

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,400
enterprises

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,599
weren't really present when it came to

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,720
you know the formation

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,000
of you know open source technology

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,599
you know not participating in what about

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,520
building not taking on leadership

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,880
positions in these communities

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,680
and so my coming here was really about

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,599
learning why that is and i think you

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,720
know i've discovered a lot since i've

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,680
been here so that

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,200
the the main challenge is how do we take

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,280
what we've learned

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
and expand it you know we've we have

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,240
engineers making contributions we've

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,839
launched open source

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,640
projects how do we make a larger splash

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,640
how do we

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,079
scale up and scale out what we'll be

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,160
able to do

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,160
to an even greater level you know how do

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,720
we how do we take it to that next level

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,560
that's

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,640
that's where my mind is right now and

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,119
that's kind of that's the reason i came

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,440
here

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,800
and um that's that's where i'm focused i

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,000
would i would say that's the

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,319
the biggest challenge you know we've

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,440
made okay we've made some great progress

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,400
but how do we how do we even take it

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,319
further than that

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,480
and that's that's the thing that um that

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,240
challenges and motivates me to

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,560
uh you know to push this forward even

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,560
further

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,240
all right looks like our time uh thank
