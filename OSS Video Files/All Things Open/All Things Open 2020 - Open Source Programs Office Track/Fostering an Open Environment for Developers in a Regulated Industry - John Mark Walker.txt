Abstract: With the institutional advantage of navigating a public-cloud migration in a highly-regulated industry, Capital One has created an innovative, low-friction environment for developers. John Mark Walker will discuss how Capital One accelerated its cloud-first vision while balancing developersâ€™ open source needs with regulatory requirements. Learn how to determine which software projects to launch; how to connect it with your overarching technology strategy; actively participate in open source communities; and foster partnerships with foundations, all while meeting regulatory requirements.
