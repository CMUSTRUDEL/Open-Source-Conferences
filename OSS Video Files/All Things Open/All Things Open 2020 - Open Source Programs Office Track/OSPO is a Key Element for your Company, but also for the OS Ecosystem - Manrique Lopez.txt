Abstract: Open Source is (becoming) the main ingredient for companies to succeed. To achieve it, companies need to manage efficiently, and with care, their relationship with the Open Source projects they consume, or the ones they contribute to, or even the ones they release, and hence with their related communities. This set of projects and communities are the company’s Open Source Ecosystem. 

That's the Open Source Program Office (OSPO)’s role. And like any ecosystem, if you don’t take care of it, your sustainability might be limited.

During this talk, you will learn about the responsibilities and benefits of having an OSPO in your organization. Also, we will give real examples of how companies are doing this today and their impact for the community, like Samsung Open Source Group, Uber, and others.

Additionally, you will learn about communities and initiatives to help you have a successful OSPO, like TODO Group and CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for Open Source Software). It’ll highlight the importance of CHAOSS and how data and metrics from the OSPO can help companies tackle their corporate strategy,but also benefit the whole company’s Open Source Ecosystem.
