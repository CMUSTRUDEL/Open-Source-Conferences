Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: Open Source is (becoming) the main ingredient for companies to succeed. To achieve it, companies need to manage efficiently, and with care, their relationship with the Open Source projects they consume, or the ones they contribute to, or even the ones they release, and hence with their related communities. This set of projects and communities are the company’s Open Source Ecosystem. 

That's the Open Source Program Office (OSPO)’s role. And like any ecosystem, if you don’t take care of it, your sustainability might be limited.

During this talk, you will learn about the responsibilities and benefits of having an OSPO in your organization. Also, we will give real examples of how companies are doing this today and their impact for the community, like Samsung Open Source Group, Uber, and others.

Additionally, you will learn about communities and initiatives to help you have a successful OSPO, like TODO Group and CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for Open Source Software). It’ll highlight the importance of CHAOSS and how data and metrics from the OSPO can help companies tackle their corporate strategy,but also benefit the whole company’s Open Source Ecosystem.

thank you

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
very much everyone for joining us today

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,920
i was expecting to meet

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,200
to meet the riley and the nice venue for

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
all things open so i think

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,800
this needs to wait for another year uh

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
let's start with with the talk uh the

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
idea is to talk about ospo i

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
assume you already know the topic but i

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
would like to start just

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,000
talking about software itself and this

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
is an old quote about sovereignty eating

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the world

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,760
i think was set around 10 years ago so

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
other things have changed but during

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
those changes that has we have seen a

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,520
lot of waves i love surfing so i will

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
i will use this for during many of my

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
talks but basically is

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,280
all these technologies that are coming

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
to companies are companies are adopting

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
technology in many areas of

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,800
of their own corporations and to achieve

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,879
that

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
is like okay they started with big data

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,079
then came artificial intelligence

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,520
machine learning now we are talking

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,160
about quantum computing

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
i i don't know what will be on 2021 but

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
the interesting thing is

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,879
all these waves means that companies

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
needs to become an i.t

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
company companies are not anymore just

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,520
banks or retail or whatever they are

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,240
becoming

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
actually technology is providing banking

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
or retailing

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
services and that's that's something of

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,759
the first things i would like to to

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,439
highlight

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,799
of course the second thing is that

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,000
actually it's open source is the one

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,040
eating the software world

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
and this is a quote from idc analyzing

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
the market

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
the expectations for the market for 2022

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
i don't know if this is going to be even

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
faster given current situation now all

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,960
these

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
discussions about digital transformation

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
but it's being said that over half of

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
the coding 75

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
of the new apps in any company will be

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
from external sources because

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
you are not able to build everything

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
from scratch the complete stack of

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
technology so you need to

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
take pieces from outside and that means

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
that people are

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
of course hiring companies to do some

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
specific developments but also people

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
are

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
and companies are taking open source

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
from outside to incorporate to their own

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
stack technologies and that

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,159
starts to get things more complicated

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
from the management point of view of the

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,640
company

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
and this is where this uh name of

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,760
hospital

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
open source program office is becoming

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,080
an important role in in a company

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
so i would like to first of all discuss

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
a little bit about what's

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,640
really in in hospital what's what's

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
going on there and what's the kind of

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,560
people that are working there

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,000
when we're talking about ospor basically

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
they are managing the relationship

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
between

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
the corporation or the company or the

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
organization with the open source

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
wall outside then so what's what's that

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,840
open source

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
looks like what that's world looks like

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
um

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
this is something i took from some

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,519
friends in in uber when they asked

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
officinover they did this kind of

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
presentation and i like this

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,800
idea of having workflows of open source

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
how open source

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
is coming to companies or going from

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
companies so i

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
see two clear workflows one is inbound

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,440
processing

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,959
so basically companies are consuming

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
open source price either because they

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
are hiring companies to

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,800
incorporate open source technology to

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
their own stack or because someone in

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
the company is taking

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
javascript libraries from outside to

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
incorporate into their own website

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,879
something like that but

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
they're consuming at some point open

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
source projects and that's the clear

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
inbound process but the results there

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,080
are also outbound processes that are

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
ready with contributing to open source

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,239
projects companies are be coming to

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,599
understand that contributing to open

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
source projects at some point

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,040
specifically if they contribute to

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
upstream projects

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
basically they are able to make the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
project to go

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
towards they want that project to go

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
basically i want to

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
give you a clear example for example

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
samsung

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
has been contributing to a lot of

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,799
graphical

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
uh open source projects to make sure

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
that once that their

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
hardware reads the market there are

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
already existing support

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
in the software to make that how hard

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,159
work

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,120
works because if they need to wait for

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
the software

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
it wouldn't be good for the market and

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
that's a clear strategy from the

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,400
business point of view that they need

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
that

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
to happen so they need to contribute to

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
the project but not only to contribute

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
they need to make that contribution to

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
be part of the prayer itself

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
that you know that that takes time it's

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
not a matter of i give you code and it's

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
going to be accepted they need to

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,160
understand how that community

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
or that process works and all that stuff

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
another thing that we are

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,759
also seeing are companies releasing open

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
source projects and that's also

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
interesting because

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
there are many strategies that are

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
already with this

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
one of course is okay there are

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
components that we need

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,840
to engage community to contribute and

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
make probably that component a better uh

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
software piece for us but another thing

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,360
that i've been hearing lately is that

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
companies are using this open source

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
project to attract talent in the sense

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
of okay

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,759
we have we are using this technology in

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
the company let's list this as an open

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
source project and people will start

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
contributing so we are going to be able

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
to see

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
who are those core contributors from

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,400
outside the company that we could hire

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,479
at some point

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
at some point the company could be also

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,440
seen as a cooler

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,440
open-source citizen in the world so

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,199
that's those are things are happening

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
when companies are using or contributing

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
to open source

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,479
so basically the ospo is the one

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,120
managing all this relationship

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,919
in the middle so so that's that's the

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
cool task

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,800
and usually when i hear about people in

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,720
in hospital in open sources about their

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
pain points sorry their tasks

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
is i've seen a very uh very specific

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
things

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
for example when they are talking about

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
consuming open source software

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
people there are people in the hospital

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
or some sort of

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,160
hospital because not all the companies

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
has already this program office

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,440
in place but there are some types that

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
are already with an hospital so

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,759
let's think about that too so there are

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
things really with license compliance

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,120
are we adopting

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
open source technology that are not

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
compliance with our

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,960
policies or are we changing anything and

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
we are not taking into account gpl or

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,160
other kind of licenses another thing

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
when we are

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,039
adopting open source projects is okay

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,039
using an open source plate that nobody

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
is maintaining how is the support of

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
display who is the one behind the

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,639
what's the health of this project itself

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
so basically that's a

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,039
typical question of course there are

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
questions related with security i am

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,840
adopting a technology that

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,400
there are some flaws of or or any

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,639
back doors in that how i can check that

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
so that's also security checks

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
and another uh interesting thing when

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
consuming open source price

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,759
is and also the way of okay this could

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
be related with attracting talent

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
because again

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
there are some pieces that if i am

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
consuming them

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
the people making that software probably

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
is also interesting for my company so at

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,639
some point it could be also a way to

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
to attract talent to the company if we

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,880
are talking about contributing to open

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
source projects

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
it could be uh also different skills

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
needed like for example okay if i need

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,160
to make a contribution and i need that

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
contribution to be accepted at some

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
point i need to be

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
see as a leader or a nice contributor so

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
i need to check okay what's my

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
leadership in the in the open source

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
place and contributing to

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,000
what's the footprint of the company in

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
these projects and you know that in

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,440
marketing is just a lot this

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
kind of codes oh we are the top

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
contributors to open source in the world

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
and things like that but also you need

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,960
to check okay i am giving code that

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
is all the ip on place or not worries

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
about

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
laws and anything like that obviously

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
and

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,080
again something that we we have been

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
listening readily uh

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,599
lately is about talent rotation this

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
idea of

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,120
if you allow your employees to

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,919
contribute to open source projects

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,039
it's been said that they are more

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,960
engaged with the company they are

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
contributing to because they are working

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
for because at some point they feel okay

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
i'm having an impact

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
on not only on the things my company are

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,520
doing but also on the things open source

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
ecosystems

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,960
outside so that's also some kind of a

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
way to

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,400
retain talent or this has been said like

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
that

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
and when they are releasing and

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
maintaining open surplus their own

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,240
projects again they need to engage

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
community they need to ensure that the

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,879
project is growing in terms of

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
contributors

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
because if the area is putting up and

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
that you know that's that's

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,800
that kind of things has happened for a

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
while or it still happens some places

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,479
is people put things on github or gitlab

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,160
and then okay this is open source i'm

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
gonna have a community now you need to

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
to ensure there is some kind of

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
community because if you don't get any

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,080
community for that open source play

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
you don't get any contribution from

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,520
outside your company it's not different

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
that having the code inside your own

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,759
company

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
so again if you are releasing an open

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,199
source place because you want at some

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
point to see visibility and to see

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
community

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,960
that's my understanding when you are

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
doing open source is not only about

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
marketing it's also

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
about creating these these communities

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,599
again

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,200
things related with a ip internet

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
property again things really with

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,880
leadership okay how i am i am dealing

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,600
with the leadership of the president and

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
another thing of course this idea of i

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,839
am

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
able to attract talent through this

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,680
project because i can check

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
nice or interesting people that could be

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,480
for

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,920
to hire in my company and for me the the

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
real pain point is

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
how deep diverse are these skills

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,080
because we are talking about

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
things related with legal we are talking

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
about things

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,959
with people management we are

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
talking about things related with uh

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,880
engineering

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,240
and all these stuff so the way i see

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
open source program office

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,839
people i i usually call them the rangers

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,040
in the organization's open source

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
ecosystem and this is a concept that

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
i've been

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,080
thinking about lately is this idea of

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,240
you as an organization

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
are surrounded by all these open source

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
projects because you consume them

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
because you contribute to them because

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
you release them

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,480
but those projects are fundamental

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
pieces for your

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
technological stack in in your company

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
so if you are not taking care of your

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
ecosystem

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
you are going to have some kind of

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,640
trouble so that could be risky there

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,360
could be a lot of troubles

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,959
around so again the hospital are the

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
rangers the people that are thinking

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,800
okay this ecosystem should be working

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
perfectly we should be avoiding any kind

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
of

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,279
bad behavior or things like that because

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
we don't want to have that issues in our

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
company right

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,839
and again as i said before the kind of

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
profiles you need to manage or you have

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,040
to at least have under this umbrella are

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
very different

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,959
and i remember i think was in a meeting

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
a couple of years ago

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
asking okay how many people are are

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
working usually

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
in these open source pronounces and it

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
was

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,079
interesting to see okay for each the

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,959
number the average number was like

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,079
for each 1000 developers in my company i

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,279
have one person

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,959
in my ospo team so that means a lot of

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,440
potential travels happening because

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,440
1000 developers able to do like

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
contribute use or con

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
release open source you need at some

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,399
point to to have all these skills

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,959
uh managed so again it's not an easy

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,519
task but i think it is important

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,880
and of course if you need help i would

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,480
like to highlight at least three

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
communities all of them

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,600
under the linux foundation umbrella that

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
i think were interesting for

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
for this idea of how to manage an ospo

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
of course one of them is the to-do group

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
they are doing an

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,959
amazing job releasing guides and

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,279
guidelines best practices about how

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,279
companies actually implementing open

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,720
source brand offices are working

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,680
like in the salesforce google github all

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
these companies

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
are already managing this situation so

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
they have guidelines there that i

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
recommend you to read so

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,320
there are the link there for them

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
another one is really of course with

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,800
this idea of okay how i can ensure

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
all the value chains the software value

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
chains i

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,200
put in place to produce my technological

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
stuff not only the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
products i i put in the market but also

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
my own technological stuff how i can

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
ensure that everything is compliant

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
there is not no flaws how i can manage

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,880
that open chain

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
is working on that openchainpro.org i

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
recommend that

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,040
and last but not least i i would like to

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,959
highlight of course one of my

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
beloved projects that this is chaos

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,959
community ks.community

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,680
that chaos stands for community health

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,680
analytics of open source software

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
so basically the idea here is how i can

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,279
measure how i can see

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
the health of open source projects so

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,279
there are a lot of we have released or

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
we have reason on august the last

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,519
version the latest release of

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,040
metrics i will recommend you to to check

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,040
them because they are very interesting

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,279
ways to okay how i can

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,720
see that there's real collaboration

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
there is fair play

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,920
how people are dealing with issues and

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,600
pull requests and all these metrics that

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
usually people think about

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,680
are discussed there through working

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
groups but also there are tools

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
to measure that and again there are open

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,920
source plays that you can already use

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
there

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,040
i will invite you to to check that

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,720
but i would like to to come back and and

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
to the topic of the quest the

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,519
of the talk actually is this idea of

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
open source software ecosystem what that

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
does it mean and why i would like to to

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,560
use the word ecosystem because this idea

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,480
of

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,680
everything is related at some point it's

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,360
not just you as the

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
big corporation that is okay i am the

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
one managing all of this

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
so because i have a very big name

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
everybody is going to do whatever they

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
want

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
no you know that that's not usually how

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
ecosystems work and if you behave like

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
that

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
probably the ecosystem is going to have

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,000
some issues and

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,079
for for me there are two main questions

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
when we are talking about okay how is

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,399
how we can manage or how can improve the

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
relation with this ecosystem first is

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
what's the limited resource in your

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,519
ecosystem because that's the

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,040
very first point you need to take into

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
account when we are talking about okay i

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
need a healthy ecosystem

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
so i need that at least whatever is

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
limited i

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
i am aware of that and i'm able to

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,760
manage that in a way that

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,200
all the expectations are said about that

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
and last but not least what are the

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
risks we are facing

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
about our ecosystem because if i take

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
any decision

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
that is i need to understand what are

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,920
the reasons when we are taking

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,199
certain decisions and i would like to

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,440
talk about that

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,440
later because i think it's quite

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,760
important

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
and for me and this is a personal view

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
and that's part of the talk i would like

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
to discuss and

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
also hear your ideas is the limited

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,120
resourcing in the ecosystem

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,399
is is it's not the code and there are

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
many people just trying to put

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
boundaries around the code of how the

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
code is used it's about the people

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
it's with the people that contribute to

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
to make open source possible

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
we are the ones that could be born out

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,920
that could be tired of contributing that

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,760
we have have issues diseases or things

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
even worse that okay i cannot contribute

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,279
anymore and basically

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,199
everything stop and the next question

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
okay when we are talking about these

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,760
people

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
is who are the ones who are the people

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,920
that build open source software um

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and usually the first thing that came to

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,920
mind is of course it's

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,760
people and organizations that are people

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,440
of course that are involved in free open

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
source software and people things

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
of course in the people that are

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,760
actually writing the code

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,519
and i would like to call them the

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,320
maintainers that people that are writing

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,480
the code

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
but in in my honest opinion in my humble

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
opinion there are

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,680
at least three kind of people that are

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,079
involved really in building open source

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,199
software and that level of involvement

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,920
usually i call that

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,000
that users you could think about them

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,600
about consumers but i'm thinking about

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
people that is not only using the

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
software is they are also asking

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
questions they are participating in

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
events they want to know more about the

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
software they are consuming

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
because there is important for them so

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,959
they need to be active

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,639
at some point in the community to make

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
sure that everything is working as they

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
want

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
the next level of involvement i would

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
say of course contributors there are

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,560
people that

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,399
okay they have some technical background

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
so they basically they are able

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
to solve that questions but they're also

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,720
able to

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,240
provide pad sets or they are able

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
depending on the platform you can

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,399
send merge requests you can sell pull

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
requests i call them contributors of

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,560
course the names

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,040
are are based on an old article i i read

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
and

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,240
many people are using different

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,880
approaches like the onion model and all

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,160
this stuff but

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,680
that's what i like to highlight

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
and last but not least the core of

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
everything are the maintainers because

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
of course there are people that need to

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
write that code they need to check that

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
the patches they are receiving

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,920
are good enough to be put on upstream

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
and they need to be good to to be

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
released

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
and all this stuff so of course

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,079
maintenance are very very important

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
and probably of course they are the most

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,839
important part of everything

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,000
but all these people have involved at

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,079
some point on making open source happen

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,480
because someone said something in a

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
forum like okay why not we do build this

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,759
thing and then a contributor send

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
a patch to change something in another

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,639
operation project

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
and take together to open source place

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,880
and then they build something completely

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,680
new

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
so again you need all these three skills

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
happening at the same time in the

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
community because

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,120
otherwise you know from again humble

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,959
opinion

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
you don't have a community you just have

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,320
people writing code

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
and that's it and i i think we need to

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
take this all

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:50,160
these people into account at some point

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
and the thing we have been very lately

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,440
and probably last year there were a lot

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,160
of discussions about this is that this

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,079
is an unbalanced war between users

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,279
containers contributors this this is

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,600
unbalanced

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
and of course it's it's very unbalanced

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
war and this

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,400
is for these are some charts i i would

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,039
like to to show you

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
about for example this is analysis i i

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,480
ran about

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,079
angular react and view all together

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400
looking basically at

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,079
github numbers and taking into account

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,360
like okay let's let's

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,760
define this way we you will have users

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,480
so basically users as i said before are

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
people

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
let's say submitting issues people that

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,559
okay i am asking about

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
specific things that i would like to

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,039
have a

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,400
or solve or ideas or whatever

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,880
and you see there are around 200

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
people weekly contributing on these

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
projects

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,440
and then you have the contributors that

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,559
are those people answering these

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,240
questions

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,480
or participating in the issues

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,200
discussion or also sending

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
pull requests um okay there are around

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
with some peaks but i would say that

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,559
there is very stable around 50. so

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,400
you see already see the unbalance and

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,559
then you see the maintainers

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
basically the people that is committing

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
code and

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,600
they are very close to contributors but

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,679
you see all this unbalanced here

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
all this space here is basically this

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
idea okay people are also

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,440
always asking for more things and we

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,679
don't have time for that and that's

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
that's of course a weird situation that

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,200
you need to manage or at some point you

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,880
need to set the expectations of how the

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
project works

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,080
but there are some cases that are

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
slightly different and this is jitsi

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,720
project the whole history of jitsi

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,679
and for example here it's not happening

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,559
the same thing

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,000
actually users are very low compared

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,600
with the number of contributors and

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,679
maintainers and actually

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,160
maintainers sometimes are even more

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,880
people than contributors

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,400
except here and you know what happened

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,039
happened to jitsi

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,360
on early 23 right everybody started

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,320
using it and then all these users appear

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,840
because everybody

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
oh this is not working i need this in

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
gitzi i need this featuring kitsy

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
and this is typical burnout situation

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,960
like okay i've been working pleasely

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,640
very peacefully nobody has worried me

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,280
and then everybody is asking for things

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
of course there

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
has been also a peak an activity but

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,200
this again

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
creates this sense of burnout you can

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,720
also see when

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
i think atlassian sold the company and

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,760
when they established the new company

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,760
all the the decrease of activity there

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,520
so again this unbalanced situation how i

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,520
can manage that and i will talk that

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
about that later because this is the

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
other thing when we are talking about

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,600
consuming and contributing open source

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,600
software many companies or many people

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,440
itself themselves they are consuming and

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
contributing without care

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,280
because it's fun it's easy it's like

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
jumping to the sky to live he's like

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,679
okay

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
very nice i can do this because it's

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
free it's for free

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
it's open source and it's for free so i

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,760
can use it i would say if you

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,559
do it without care of course it can be

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,200
very funny but it can be also very risky

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,039
and

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
i i don't need to highlight situations

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
like secure as i said before security

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
flaws

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
all these problems about okay changes in

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
the licensing

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
people contributing and not accepting my

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,480
uh contributions

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
like companies that are coming to prison

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
saying okay i have this big name i have

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,440
this

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
ten thousand lines of code that's gonna

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
solve your all your problems in the

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,520
product and

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,360
here it is i said my bad set and then

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,039
they receive a yes you need to check

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
this and check that and change this and

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,840
it's like okay i am

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,240
why are you treating me like that and

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
all these situations is where i think

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,280
that one of the goals of

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,919
any hospital or any open source program

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,840
office should be at some point to ensure

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,039
their consistent sustainability because

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
at some point or

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
understanding that they are the ones

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
managing these relationships with the

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
projects

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
and in their skills there are people

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,000
that know how open source work

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
because probably not every company not

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
all the levels of the company not every

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,760
developer in the company

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,440
might know how open source ecosystems

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,840
and how open source communities

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,919
work they need to train or to at some

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,760
point uh

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,000
just train the people in the company

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,520
about okay how you need to use this how

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
you need to contribute to this

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,120
and how you can be a maintainer at some

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
point and for me it's a matter of

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,280
understanding

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,840
how you can do this path like

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,400
from being a user like okay i'm just a

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,720
company

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,760
that basically submitting issues asking

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
questions in

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
stack overflow of in the github

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
repositories

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,559
and this kind of person or this kind of

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
of

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,400
company and if i well i would like to

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,679
ensure the sustainability of the

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,919
ecosystem at some point

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,240
i need to start also behaving as a

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,120
contributor to the ecosystem

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,320
like okay let's start seeing how i can

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,720
solve issues and i'm

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,320
pretty sure that most of the companies

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
using open source software

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,360
has have people have people in in their

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,600
companies

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,760
technologically skilled enough to

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,400
participate solving issues

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,400
and also to answering questions and even

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
to send patches like okay i've seen this

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
easy to solve and it's not only about

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
having hacked over fairs we could have

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,600
oktoberfest we could have hacked

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,240
november first we could have

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,159
hacked december fest and have faced all

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
the of the year round so let's make that

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,919
happen

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,760
at some point and then from there

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,120
if you start participating in the

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
community in that way

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,640
things that we have seen is at some

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,480
point people are accepted as maintainers

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,799
because you are sending patches you your

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
code is good enough to be part of the

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,120
of the project so make that that happen

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,080
so let's start also reviewing and

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
accepting

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,520
the patches that the community is

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
sending let's start coding the real

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,720
thing

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
and also discuss about the governance or

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
this

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,080
the roadmap itself and and for me is

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,120
where everything changes when okay

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,799
me as part of the ecosystem i am also

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,720
deciding where the ecosystem goes

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,480
and that's that's something that i think

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,120
is a long path

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,559
but i think ospos has all the knowledge

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,640
and all the tools out there

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,159
just to make this happen at some point

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
and of course when we are talking about

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
this many people start thinking oh but

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,360
to ensure the consistent society it's a

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,520
matter of putting money on the table and

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,720
paying maintainers of course that's also

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
a good point and i would like to

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,480
highlight at least some options to make

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
that happen

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,240
of course there are companies and and

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,400
ideas out there that building business

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,400
models based on okay how i can

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
make sustainability a business model for

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
open source at some point and tidylift

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,880
and open collective a very good examples

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
of them i'm pretty sure you already know

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
then

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,280
foundations open source foundations are

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,320
becoming

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,600
they have seen some kind of a potential

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
business but also

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,120
this idea okay we are foundation we have

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
some kind of responsibility to the price

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
it's not only about membership

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
it's also about giving to the projects

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
and sharing their society

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,440
again i would like to highlight

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
sovereign freedom conservancies one of

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,760
the

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
foundations i love the most but also

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,320
community bridge initiative from the

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,799
dinner foundation

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
is quite interesting of course if your

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,960
company

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,960
is able to do that and i would like to

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,520
highlight indeed and salesforce

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,320
initiative like okay why not

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
er creating our own open source software

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
funding initiative

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,559
to sustain the projects my company

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
depends on and

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,840
they have very nice papers published

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
about how they are running this how they

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,840
are

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,440
checking which prices their people or

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,279
the people working in the company

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,559
is contributing to even in the spare

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,600
time because at some point

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,679
if that people is interesting for me

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,720
if i ensure that the projects they are

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,720
contributing to

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,760
are sustainable every everybody is going

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,200
to be happy

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,200
it's a win-win situation why not

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
supporting that

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,039
and of course this this idea of i would

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,799
like to to call them

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,120
pro is not the best name but this i have

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,440
dig development like tips or

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,799
things like github sponsors patreon

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
initiative like that okay you

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,640
give a tip to a project probably that

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,559
doesn't ensure the sustainability

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
of the maintainer or the project itself

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,000
but of course it helps but

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,039
that's something to think about that if

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,120
you're thinking about society

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,400
but i would like to highlight one last

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,559
option that

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,320
not many people think about that and is

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,760
hiding is also an option when we are

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,919
talking about open source

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,799
projects and usually all the

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,159
discussion is about how corporations are

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,520
doing things

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,520
and of course when you're talking about

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
free open source software it's like okay

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,320
and

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
me as maintainer i'm putting the

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,600
software that for you

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
under a license that said this is the

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,679
code as it is there is no

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,640
line in the license that says i need to

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,320
give you support

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
that's that's the first expectation you

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
need to understand when you are

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
using or consuming open source software

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,919
it's like

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
don't expect the maintainer to do the

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
job for you

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
that's the first thing of course he does

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
or she does

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
thank you very much i i really

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,159
appreciate that but i know the license

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,880
i'm

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,400
using and the license doesn't say any

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
anywhere in the in the license or in the

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
governance usually says that

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,360
this is how i'm going to support the

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,679
prey itself and actually the license

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,039
i'll say this is this code that is and

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,360
that's that's very important

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,960
but there are a lot of companies and

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
there could be companies and even for

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
the maintenance it could be a business

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
model

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,159
about okay i can provide consulting

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,200
customization

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,080
support many ideas of how to build

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,720
business models

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,240
around open source software i wouldn't

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,120
call that open source business models

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
but

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,679
you can call that if you want but the

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,600
important idea for me is like

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,720
many companies and this is something i i

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,559
personally have seen

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,640
in in some places median and become

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,080
big size companies they don't hire these

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,120
people because they are too small they

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
have a lot of

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
problems and bureaucracy to enter into

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,279
the project so basically

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
they don't end hiring them that would be

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,600
one thing but the other thing that i

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,679
have here is like

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
but that that's a small project someone

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,880
is maintaining so basically we have all

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,760
these developers in my company

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,080
i don't need to to pay them i can

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,640
rebuild from scratch all that technology

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,320
like okay if it's not invented in my

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,080
company is is not well enough

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,080
i i call that the not invented here

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,240
syndrome like many people

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,600
see something interesting instead of

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,039
they check it and then they

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,720
they build their own stuff i wouldn't

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,840
say that that's

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,200
a very efficient way to to advance but

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,440
they don't know there's another way they

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,559
go and hire them find ways to to hire

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,559
these people

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,760
or these small companies to make all

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,840
this uh

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,919
build all this thing together and again

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,279
that's that's another way of creating a

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,840
ecosystem like

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,600
if we are all sustained at some point we

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,520
are going to be happy and that's that's

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,480
very important

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,600
so some final remarks to to end my at

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,679
least the slides and

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
we can go for the questions and

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,799
discussion

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,559
my final remarks has an hospital manage

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
something that is very complex and very

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
diverse that is actually the

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,039
relationship between

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,159
my organization and all the open source

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
trades around it

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,440
and usually people think that that's

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
just one

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,679
two projects and i remember a talk from

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,880
bbc that they they have some

00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,159
bbc the broadcasting uh television in

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,720
in the united kingdom uh they were they

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
were

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
showing some interesting numbers like

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,440
okay we have these two engineers in

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,520
in a team and they are using these uh

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,640
three four open source projects and then

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,320
they check then

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,120
the number of people contributing to

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,520
those projects so basically for them

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,440
the way they see they see this is we are

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,159
not managing two people we are managing

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,600
a team of

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,520
actually 125 people for example

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
one two of them are working for us and

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,840
they are being paid for us directly but

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,679
the other

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,279
123 are depending at some point of

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,960
how we support them at some point

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
because we are using that technology

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
and we are contributing back so that

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,840
that's one thing and that again is not

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,080
only about

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,159
license or people management or or even

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
engineering is about how i can be sure

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,799
that we are all happy

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,080
on this ecosystem and because that means

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,880
that you need to take care of that

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
ecosystem

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
because your sustainability and growth

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,200
depends on it and that's for me it's

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
something that is

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
this key to understand and this is

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
becoming more and more important each

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
year

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,600
that technology grows that is coming

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,000
more complex that at some point

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,760
i i think at some point it's gonna be

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,640
really hard to know

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,799
what are all the open source pieces i am

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,919
putting on place to make my banking

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,440
account system

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
because when we're talking about

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,159
technology it seems like it's very very

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,840
very direct i have this of this

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,720
i don't know this id solution or this

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,840
process of

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,279
solution or this big data solution so

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,799
it's using these pieces

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,960
but we are talking about service to

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,760
people like things like banking

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,440
retail all these things that now people

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,159
are thinking okay i need to do this

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,840
online

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,679
all these technologies that are behind

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,279
the curtains there is an open source

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,919
ecosystem at some point there and you

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
need to

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,279
check all these things because at some

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,640
point if that breaks

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,200
that's going to create a lot of troubles

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
and all this technology is built by

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
people

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,600
and well it's been said at some point ai

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,880
is going to be able to code

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,880
i i would like to to see when

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,039
i i know there are some demos out there

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,840
but that things have been trained

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,520
using already existing code or a people

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,720
that has written code

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,080
and i i like somewhere i read their

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,480
like software is something that is being

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,240
written by humans to be read by humans

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,559
and to be executed by computers

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,919
i think that was the code more or less

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,399
and that's important thing as at some

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,559
point

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,440
a human should be able to check that or

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,840
even to

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,240
write that so again if you don't have

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,480
people smart or people involved in the

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,320
open source ecosystem there's gonna is

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,240
not gonna be any open source ecosystem

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,360
at all

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,760
so again hiring don't forget that

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,520
hiring is a is an option avoid please

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,919
they're not inventing here center go

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,000
there

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,799
check which projects are are you already

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,399
participating contributing and using

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,120
and if it's possible it could be also an

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,320
option to

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,840
to make that happen and i was expecting

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,399
to 30 minutes i went

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,000
31 minutes now so i think we have some

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,679
some time for questions

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
you have all my details there for for

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,600
contact of course

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
but that would be my my slides and i'm

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,840
open to

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,840
to answer any question you might have

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
here

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,000
again you guys can post questions to

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,840
minri using the chat feature or the q a

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
feature you can raise your hand

00:31:47,840 --> 00:32:01,840
i think i can see who's connected just

00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:01,840
to check

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:15,840
do i need to check the chat or

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
yes

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,000
i think we don't have any questions yeah

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,640
there is a question in the

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
in the chat from jacob green he says

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,000
thanks minority

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,919
good talk how many ospos are there

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,679
wow that's very interesting question

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,720
thank you and jacob for for making that

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,000
uh the thing i've seen is that

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,440
there are probably more uh open source

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
paragraphs that people think

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
as i said in the beginning like at some

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,480
point in

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,720
at least in mature companies i'm not

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,159
talking about all the companies but at

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
some point in

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
medium and big size companies there are

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,399
certain tasks like

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,600
without ospo that have been doing

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,720
by legal staff or even by hiding

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,760
and sorry

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,000
people management teams

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,120
and something i've been discovering

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,240
lately is when i

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,039
have talked with some with some

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,960
people interested in the concept oh i

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
think we need an ospo

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
they think like okay i need to talk with

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,799
my engineering managers about

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
why we should be taking this into

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,559
account how these

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:56,000
things could be put in place and usually

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,919
they have very i would say like barriers

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
to make this happen because they see

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
this like oh this is another complex

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,440
thing to manage and we need to do that

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,720
as an engineering team my usual

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
suggestions is

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,399
don't go there first go to the legal

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,280
area and ask okay

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,800
do you know how how we are dealing with

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,240
legal compliance for the open source

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,919
place we are using

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,639
and they go to the sorry to the

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,960
people management team and do you know

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,440
that

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,960
we if we will have this hospital we can

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
manage all these things about

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,639
attracting and retaining talent in very

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,760
different ways

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,520
and this is where opera style doors

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,480
start to open now okay let's create a

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,839
hospital because

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,480
this this could also relax and

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,879
focus things on okay if we are doing

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,639
this

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,399
as an open source way and we are

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,159
contributing and using open source place

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,720
we we should be managing this at some

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,639
point

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,639
and then is when engineering can boot

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,679
put in place to say

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,679
okay if instead of creating forks of

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,000
open source price for my own thing

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,200
i can learn how to contribute back to

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,520
these projects

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,599
upstream then probably things are going

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
to be easier more efficient

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,760
is where people start to learn about the

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,320
next steps so i will say

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,520
that any medium company has all these

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
kind of skills

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,640
and happening at some point but if you

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,560
are

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,720
asking about the specific number i would

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,800
say that to-do group has a very detailed

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
list of companies under hospice and

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,240
actually most of the members in the to

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,640
the group you check the

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,000
the website they have like a list of i

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,680
don't remember exactly the name but the

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
number sorry but they are

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,720
very good names some very well known

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,760
names there

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,200
but the thing for me is about when we

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,800
are gonna see

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,240
non non-born non-technical born

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,079
companies becoming

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,079
uh or having an hospital because this is

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
where culture has changed at some point

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,720
in these companies

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,960
because i mean microsoft or github

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,000
or companies that are clearly technical

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,160
companies are

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
technological companies producing

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,160
software or

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,359
depending on software from day one they

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,800
know that ospos

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
matter and they have hospitals and you

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,480
can check that in the to the group uh

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,000
members list but when you start seeing

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,160
companies that probably their

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,520
main business or is not related i mean

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,560
it's nothing with sovereign but not with

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,440
the services

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,480
of selling or of that software you know

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,560
when i see okay

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,079
things are start to change in the

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,280
culture in these companies

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,040
and that's that's the for me the

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
challenge and that's i would like to to

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
see more happening

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:35,119
i don't know if that answer your

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:35,119
