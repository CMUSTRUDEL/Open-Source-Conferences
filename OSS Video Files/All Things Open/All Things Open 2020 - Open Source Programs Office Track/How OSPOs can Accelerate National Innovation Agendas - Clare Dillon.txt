Description: 
	Presented by: Clare Dillon, Moss Labs
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: Clare is a relative newbie to the open source world. She got involved because she believes that open source is a way to construct alternative systems of innovation and remove some of the friction that is plaguing current efforts of "digital transformation". She has learned open source can help build trust, promote openness and collaboration, and provide alternative pathways to get involved with technology. As part of the OSPO++ Working Group, Clare is working with individuals and institutions in Ireland and abroad to explore how the establishment of Open Source Program Offices can help accelerate innovation in Ireland. In this session, Clare will outline the opportunities she sees for Ireland in the open source world and will share how working with the OSPO++ Working Group can help realize these opportunities.

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,559
i am delighted to be here today so thank

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,599
you so much for having me

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,440
um i just wanted to say that uh

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
today's talk is also going to include

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
how open source in general can

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
accelerate national

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,400
innovation agendas and before i go

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,840
too far i just want to give a brief uh

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
introduction to myself

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
and it's probably worth mentioning at

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
this point in time

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,240
that i am neither an open source

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,399
developer nor

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,920
have i been involved in open source very

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,760
long so i am a recent

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
convert to the whole open source

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,559
movement and but i'm hoping

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
that as i share my journey of how i was

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,440
converted

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
and how i'm hoping to convert others

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
that there might be something useful for

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
people

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
and i probably should also say that i'm

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
still on this journey

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
and i would really welcome anyone who

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,039
has feedback

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
and about how i can improve this journey

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,559
or in fact

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,440
help me help others come on the same

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,239
journey so

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,359
that's that's my goal with today and

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
when i was thinking about

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,640
the idea of uh national innovation

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
agendas

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
that's really where i came from when i

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,200
started thinking about open source

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
so for a long time i have been involved

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
in

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
ireland's technology ireland innovation

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
forum

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
and that group is all about the idea of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,600
how do we actually

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
accelerate innovation in ireland and it

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
was through other

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
other ways that i actually came across a

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,560
lot of folks in the open source and in

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
fact the inner source community

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
and then after a while i was kind of

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,600
thinking hey why aren't

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,119
people in ireland talking more about

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
this because it seems to me

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,479
that when you look at the agenda for

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
national innovation

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
and i've i've pulled out some of the

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,520
topics that are involved in ireland's uh

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,399
national innovation papers that that

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
come from

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
our department for business enterprise

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
and innovation

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
and i'm pretty sure that these will be

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
very similar topics

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
and that other national agendas

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
innovation agendas may have

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
but the idea that we want to accelerate

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
or d that we want to

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,000
accelerate the impact of r d in

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
enterprise that we want to think about

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
how education can drive innovation

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
that we want to think about social and

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
economic development and how innovation

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
can

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
impact both of those we want to think

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,280
about transfer of knowledge

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
and we want to think about global

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
collaboration and when i think about

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,319
these themes

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
and i think about what open source can

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,680
provide

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
um i'm thinking that there are a lot of

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
ways in which open source can actually

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,680
help

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
so let's look at how from my perspective

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
the first thing is of course the

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
accelerated r d

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,519
now for me one of the main benefits

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
that everyone knows about that from an

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
open source perspective is that it just

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,480
speeds things up right if you don't have

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
to reinvent the wheel if you can take

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,160
best practices that have already been

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
tried and tested that hundreds or maybe

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,319
even thousands of developers have used

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
already

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,080
but why would you start from scratch

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,480
this is the prime reason

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
why open source has become so popular so

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
it accelerates for search and

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
development

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
if people can actually take code that's

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,120
already been written and we also know

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,760
that these days in the open source world

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
there has been a lot of focus in various

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
different industry verticals

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
and how the open source open source can

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
actually drive

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
those uh those industries these days but

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,959
not only that

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
because a recent report from mckinsey

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,000
shows that not

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,519
that that open source development

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
doesn't just speed up

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
the actual building of of code but the

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,360
practices

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
themselves can accelerate developer

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,319
velocity so regardless about the fact

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,200
that you're just

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
assembling pre you know components or

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
modules that you found

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
out there or in github or whatever even

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,840
the practices of open source

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440
can actually speed up innovation and

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,440
what they found mckinsey found

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
was that actually the companies that

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
were engaging in open source

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
practices and both contributing from an

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,640
open source perspective to

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,080
open source projects but also just using

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
the practices like for example

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
in inner source where you take open

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
source practices and use them within

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,200
inside a firewall both of those things

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
actually speeds up

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,799
um development and speeds up developer

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,640
velocity so it seems to me that

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
for if you want to accelerate or d why

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
wouldn't you go with inner sort with

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
open source and the second thing is

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,880
around this idea of

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
enterprise impact so for me again

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
if you're trying to do enterprise

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
collaborations or corporate

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
collaborations

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
one of the easiest ways to do that and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
to remove all the friction that might be

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
might come with the idea of ip licensing

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,880
and thinking about that

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
is to do it through open source and what

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
we're seeing these days is the rise of

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
many

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
um industry vertical groups that are

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,440
actually focused

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
on the very specific problems of

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,240
industry

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
and solving them together and that kind

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
of co-opetation

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,840
is happening across the board finos is a

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
great example of that where you've got

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,520
lots of fintech companies and banks

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
who are all coming together to

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,280
collaborate on common banking problems

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,479
and actually uh and actually be

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,160
able to use their internal teams when

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
they're thinking about differentiating

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
they can all

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,160
differentiate differently but for the

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
common problems they're all

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
collaborating

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
so again if we're thinking about how r d

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
can actually accelerate

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
impact in enterprise then one of the

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
best things to do is to think about open

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
source

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
and of course we also know that there's

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,720
a huge skills gap when it comes to

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,919
developers in particular so i should say

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
developers in general

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,360
and open source developers in particular

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
so when we think

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,440
about how national agendas can

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
help industry then one of the things

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
they can

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
and should do is think about how can we

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
fill

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,240
the jobs that are out there with skilled

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
open source

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,840
and potentially inner source developers

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
which brings us to the third point

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,280
the idea of skills for the future and

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,120
education

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,000
when i think about um how universities

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
or or national agendas when we think

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
about education

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
can actually increase innovation in a

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
country

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
then we have to think about the skills

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
that we're actually

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,319
giving to our citizens in order to

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,199
enable them to actually participate

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
in the global tech ecosystem and as i

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,240
mentioned earlier

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,160
when we think about open source it's not

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,280
just the skills to be able to

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,039
participate with

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,440
it within open source communities and

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,240
projects but the very nature

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
of open source collaboration can help

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
developers

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,440
actually build a broader set of skills

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,440
things like conflict resolution

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
community development you know

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
understanding the legals and compliance

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
issues

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
many of these skills are broader than

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,840
just tech skills

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,759
and they can really help round out um

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,639
anyone involved in the tech industry

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
and so for me that's a really key set of

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,759
skills

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,639
that from a national perspective we

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
should be thinking

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
about giving to everyone involved in

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
technology

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
and then this idea of social and

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
economic impact

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,360
well it's been proven with recent

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,599
studies that

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
the economic impact of open source can

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
be quite significant

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
so there's a chap called frank nagle

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
who's done a lot of research in this

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
area

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,280
and when you look at his reports he

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
shows that he can measure it on a

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
national

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,400
perspective from a national perspective

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,319
that for every one percent of increase

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880
in github contributions that a nation

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,840
makes you get increases across a

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
wide variety of areas things like the

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
numbers of ventures that are actually

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
created

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
things like the number of financing

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
deals that are happening in the country

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,240
things like the number of acquisitions

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,599
that are happening in the country

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
things like the the the number of

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,560
mission-oriented ventures that are

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,360
actually being started up in a country

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
so there is a direct correlation between

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
having open

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,360
source and promoting open source in your

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,360
country

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
and having an economic impact in terms

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
of the indigenous kind of uh

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,639
organizations that are being started up

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,800
but not only that

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
there is also the potential for a lot

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,479
more social impact

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
when we think about how we translate

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,879
research

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
not only on a path of ip monetization or

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
licensing

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,919
but also taking the things that are

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
going to be for social good

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
and bringing them out into the open and

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
allowing

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,919
for for people in

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,080
the actual people who will be using the

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
software to engage with that

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
and to build trust around those sort of

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,840
things and i'll tell you a story about

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,759
that in a little while

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,599
then this idea of knowledge transfer

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
well when i read something like

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,440
knowledge transfer i'm thinking

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
that's made for open source i mean the

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
whole point

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
about being open in how you work and how

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,800
you

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,360
deliver um the output of your research

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,159
helps with knowledge transfer i was uh

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
listening to

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
one university researcher and he was

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
describing how

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,920
he has been frustrated by some of the

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
research that he's seen published in

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
magazines

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,160
whereby they say and there was software

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,920
uh

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,399
created to test this and uh

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,160
it's there but there was no link to it

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,920
there was no way to actually test it out

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,279
there was no way to verify that research

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,320
by running that code

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,040
when we think about the the

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
the necessary uh levels that we want to

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
get to

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
in science where we verify what people

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
what researchers are doing

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
we need to think about software being

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
accessible

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
so that research results can be verified

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
and repeated and built upon so when we

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,360
think about knowledge transfer

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,880
in the context of an r d ecosystem we

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
really need to think about open source

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
and then the last thing was

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
international collaboration and in my

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,680
book

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,279
there is no better way to facilitate

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
international collaboration from an

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,680
order perspective

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,880
than by the use of of open source

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,920
uh i was i heard uh syed chowdhry who is

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
the director of

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,320
johns hopkins university talking about

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
his collaborations with the city of

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
paris

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
and they've actually taken some of the

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
city services that paris created

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,120
um in an open source project called

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,040
lutes and they've helped implement those

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,640
for the city of baltimore

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
and it's an amazing collaboration and

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
it's fantastic to see it happening

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,120
but syed mentioned that if he had not

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
been able to collaborate through open

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
source

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
that collaboration would would probably

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
be still

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,079
stuck in legal wranglings about how we

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
actually get

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
code and and license code across borders

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
and across

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,720
universities and institutions so when we

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
think

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
about facilitating international

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
collaboration

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,839
the best way to do that is through these

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
recognized constructs like open source

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,240
that where people can freely collaborate

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
without worrying about individual

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
license agreements that they have to

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,839
actually negotiate

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
and of course particularly in europe at

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
any rate and i'm sure this is the

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
same across the world many research

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
institutions now

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,600
are actually getting much more favorable

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
policies in terms of open source

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
so lots of the large research

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
institutions as i said in europe but

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,600
anyway people like cern

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,320
or the national space telescope even in

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,720
terms of

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
various different organizations they're

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
all looking to open source to help them

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
accelerate what they're doing so if we

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,640
want to collaborate with them

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,880
we also have to be in the open source

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,519
game per se

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,480
so for me when i think about

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
accelerating

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
a national innovation agenda it turns

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,720
out that open source

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,880
is kind of essential for that it you

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
have to do it in order to be able to

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
go as fast as you can in all of these

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
areas

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
so it's kind of a no-brainer and but i

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
do

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,079
think that actually some of the

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,959
conversations around open source

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
in ireland at any rate um there are some

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,680
still

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
perhaps outdated ideas and narratives

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,959
around open source that

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,880
stop people who are involved in

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,680
innovation policies and agendas

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,440
and understanding or or getting on board

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,040
with the idea that open source can be an

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,959
accelerator for this

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
so the next thing i'm going to cover is

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,079
this idea of

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,000
how are we talking about open source now

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
i don't probably like that none of this

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
is new to most of the people

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,600
at all things open i know that everyone

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
here is probably an advocate of open

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
source

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,240
probably has heard these arguments many

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,120
times i'm hoping that by putting them

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
out like this it

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
it helps kind of remind everyone about

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,279
the strength of it

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,880
and but i do think that when we think

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,079
about the conversations

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,279
that we are having outside the open

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
source ecosystem

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,800
it is important to think about what

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
conversations we have

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
with whom for best effect in order to

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
bring forward

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
the open source agenda and i want to

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
first of all tell you a story about

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,600
ireland and one of the things that

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,639
really has shifted the idea in ireland

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,279
quite a lot

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,480
and above and beyond the the points that

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,120
i laid out there around

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
innovation and how we create innovative

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,959
solutions

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,399
one of the main points for me around

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,399
innovation agendas

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
is actually not the creation of the

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
innovation but it's the adoption of the

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
innovation

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
and again open source for me plays a key

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
part

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,920
in building the trust that's required

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,760
for citizens and other folk to be able

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,519
to adopt technology

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
and when i think about digital

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,959
transformation and everyone's got a

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
digital transformation agenda

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,720
so often the success of a digital

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
transformation agenda

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,399
is more dependent on people's ability to

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,120
adopt technology

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,839
than it is on our ability to create it

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
in ireland

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
there was a prime example of that back

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
in march

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
we had the same kind of pandemic

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
situation as everyone else around the

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
world

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
and at that time our health service

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,680
executive we're looking for

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,079
a track and trace technology that would

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,720
help

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,320
the effort in terms of combating covet

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
and they decided to build an app

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,399
and it went through some iterations in

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
terms of looking at best practices

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
around the world

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,399
but during the development of that app

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,959
it was decided that it really

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
had to be open source in order for

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,560
privacy

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
advocates and experts to be able to look

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
at the source code

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
and make sure that it was trustworthy

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,760
because that trust

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,959
was so essential in terms of actually

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
encouraging

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,160
the citizens of ireland to download and

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,279
use this app

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,519
so they did that they they made the the

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,040
source code public before the launch of

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,880
the app and as a result

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
all the privacy experts gave it a thumbs

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,839
up which is fantastic

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,760
um and the numbers of people who

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
downloaded and installed that app were

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
out of this world

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
so they were completely blown away i

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,320
think something like 33

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
of the population had downloaded within

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,199
the first week which was

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,040
far and above the best result of any app

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,240
of its kind in the world

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,279
so i think when we think about

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,000
trust and we think about innovation

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,279
in the context of how people are using

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,279
technology

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,000
it provides one of the the best um

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
benefits for open source when we think

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
when we think about how it can be used

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
at a national level

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
um and i one further thing about that is

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,160
is that

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
it's accessible as well so one of the

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,399
first pull requests that was

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,880
done against the irish tracker app was

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,880
some person who had decided that

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,440
they had noticed that the spelling of a

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
town called kahr savin which is a small

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,079
small town

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,399
down in in the in the far

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,759
reaches of of ireland and someone had

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,680
said that's not how we spelled

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
carasevine and carasevine

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,360
and i thought that's amazing these are

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,639
citizens who are not just using this app

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
but they are making it

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,600
their own they are engaging with the

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,240
source code so that they can actually

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,160
make it more relevant to them and again

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
that is one of the primary benefits when

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,320
we think about how

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,360
open source can actually impact national

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
agendas in that way

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,120
so when we actually look

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,399
at the idea of i want to introduce this

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
idea of mind flex

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,199
sorry i was just checking the chat there

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
and thank you for for the comments as

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
we're as

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,120
we're going through this i'll keep an

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
eye on them but when when we think about

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,800
this idea of mind flex i want to

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
introduce this kind of concept

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,880
and it was something that i read on

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,519
twitter a few weeks ago right

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,800
and it was by a guy called dave snowden

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,320
i don't know if many of you would be

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,959
familiar with his work but he

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
is the um originator of the kinevin

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,480
framework for sensemaker

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
and he talks about complex adaptive

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,839
systems

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
and he talks about how we deal in a

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,320
complex world

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
how we need to move towards more

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,639
experimentation how we need to move away

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,759
from this idea that we have all the

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,199
answers

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
and it really got me thinking now he

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,120
mentioned this quote about this idea of

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,279
um i think he was actually referring to

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,360
the agile community he gets a bit

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,959
uh controversial sometimes so he was he

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
was saying something about this idea of

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,720
stopping

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,480
mindset and starting to talk about mind

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,920
flex and it really hit me because

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,120
there's an awful lot of conversations

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,679
that happen around

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,520
open source mindset right or or

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,319
collaborative mindset

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,199
but this idea of flexing your mind it

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,520
got me thinking

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,760
how can we actually think about how we

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,439
flex our ideas about open source and

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,919
flex other people's ideas about open

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,400
source

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,280
in order to accelerate the open source

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
agenda

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
it reminded me actually of a quote from

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,039
f scott fitzgerald who talked about this

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,440
idea of being of the ability to hold

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,799
two opposing ideas in your mind and how

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
that's a first-rate

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
a sign of first-rate intelligence um or

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,400
indeed james joyce

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
an irish author and he talked about this

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,720
idea of having two thinks

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,679
at the same time and i started thinking

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
well

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
how can we use that concept to think

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
about

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,320
how to create arguments and and and

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
narratives and stories around open

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
source that will become even more

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,720
compelling for people who don't

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
necessarily or haven't

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
grown up in that ecosystem don't

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
understand the value so what i want to

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
do now

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,280
is maybe look at a few examples of how

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
we might think

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,799
differently or in fact think two things

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,720
at the same time

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,600
around open source and how that could

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,919
help us as we have these discussions

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,720
um at a national level in terms of how

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,320
open source can be used

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,000
so the first thing is around this idea

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
of open source and money

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and i think this is a really interesting

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
one because there are literally two

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,280
narratives that are happening

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
simultaneously around open source and

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
money

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,280
there is a whole kind of set of ideas

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
around the

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,760
around the fact that there's not enough

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,400
money getting to open source maintainers

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,360
but there is simultaneously an entire

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
conversation

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
around the idea that there is so much

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
opportunity

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,840
commercial opportunity in the open

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
source world that is on

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,520
probably on leverage to the degree that

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
it should be

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,760
and so for me these are two things that

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
are both true simultaneously

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,039
but feel a little bit conflicting

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,640
there's not enough money

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,080
and maybe there's there's so much money

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
there's so much opportunity

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
so it's kind of like this is a prime

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,679
example of how we need to think

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,000
about having two things simultaneously

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
and how we need to flex between these

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
ideas and between these narratives

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,400
as we talk to people because it is both

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
true that there's a huge amount of

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,000
opportunity and commercial opportunity

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
in the open source world

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
but at the same time we need to make

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,880
sure that the

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,559
the the cash that's in the ecosystem

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
gets to the right people gets to

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,760
maintainers at the same time

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,120
but having that conversation the right

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
conversation in the right place at the

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
right time with the right people

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
can really help impact and drive forward

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
the whole

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,320
agenda and discussion the second thing

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,559
is this idea of

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,679
open source i want to say versus

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,000
proprietary code

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
because again there is there are two

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
ways and two kinds of conversations that

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
happen around this

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,039
there are a group of people who believe

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880
that open source

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,559
should always be the case we should make

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
everything open we should use open

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,520
source software it should be open source

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
only and always there's another group of

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,559
people

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
and often a lot of the people who are

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,720
just getting

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,720
into open source they feel more

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
comfortable with this mix of open source

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,919
and proprietary code they see more

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,320
opportunity in that respect

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
or perhaps they just can't be you know

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
persuaded to move off their favorite

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,520
proprietary

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,720
platform that they potentially are using

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,720
for for

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
um for whatever their whatever they're

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,360
doing but this idea that

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,600
there are two ways to look at this is

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
important because both are valid

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
it is true that there is a group of

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
people who will only

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,679
who want to push forward the open source

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,760
agenda so dramatically that they will

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,039
you know they they have chosen to use

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,080
open source all the time

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,000
but that should not block

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
people who want to mix their use of open

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
source and proprietary

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,320
code from participating in the open

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,159
source community

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,679
so for me this is another example of two

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,280
things both should be

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,200
both should be possible both should be

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,760
supported and both

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,840
are our valid approaches to how we use

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,039
open source and both should feel welcome

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,200
in the open source world also around the

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,760
path to open source because

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
um from my perspective there again are

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,679
two narratives that i've heard around

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
this

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,039
uh there is this idea that we could that

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
people should

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,480
jump directly to open source when uh

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
when we think about that we should make

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
sure that people get directly into

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
github they should be contributing to

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
the community

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
but there's a second path that people

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,840
are exploring

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
and that's this idea of using inner

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,520
source as a path

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,039
to open source now inner source being

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,799
taking the methods

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,840
of open source and the practices that

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,280
are that have emerged around the

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,520
collaboration around open source

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,840
and bringing it inside the firewall and

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,440
using it to develop proprietary code

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
and i happen to be involved with inner

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,280
source commons and

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,440
primarily actually because i see it as a

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
way to help corporations accelerate

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,240
their development even if they're not

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
doing open source

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,679
and i know that a lot of organizations

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
who've gotten involved in inner source

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,640
are doing it

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,200
to help peop help them on a path to open

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
source

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,520
and of course the more people that are

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,600
actually learning how to collaborate

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,679
how to actually develop in an open way

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
the more likely and easy it is for them

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,720
to take the path to open source

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
so in many respects again both are valid

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
approaches

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,600
this is a two think thing we can both

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
provide opportunities for people to jump

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,919
into open source

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,919
or and or both and

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,360
use inner source as a path to open

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
source so it's important to understand

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,960
that these are

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,400
two things that can happen and depending

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,559
on your context

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
one might be easier than the other and

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,480
we want to make sure there is as many

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,919
easy paths into open source as possible

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
and now there's one that comes close to

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,960
my heart this idea of open source and

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
diversity

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,480
i have spent many long hours in

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
conversations and panel sessions and

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
working groups

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,240
around diversity and tech i've spent

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,200
over 20 nearly 25 years now in the tech

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,159
industry

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,120
and this is a constant challenge right

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,080
this idea of

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,840
um diversity from all perspectives uh

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
gender but also marginalized groups of

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,640
all types

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,320
and i've noted that in the open source

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
community there are again two

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,400
discussions that happen around this

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,200
first of all you know it's pretty

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
obvious from

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
various different discussions that there

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,600
are scenarios where open source

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,320
community have issues with diversity

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,280
inclusion that not every project as

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
is as either diverse or as inclusive as

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,120
we'd like

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,279
on the other hand open source i see open

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,799
source as a huge opportunity to increase

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,200
diversity and inclusion

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,080
i mean i as i mentioned i've been in the

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
tech industry

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,880
for over 25 years or nearly 25 years now

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,320
and for the last number of decades i

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,799
have never even attempted

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,039
to actually develop any code and yet it

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,679
was my through my participation with the

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
inner source

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,120
commons community that and because they

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
work in an open way

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,400
that i had my first experience of

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,360
actually

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,120
setting up a github account creating prs

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
committing code making changes to the

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,279
website

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,279
and i remember when i first did that i

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,120
got such a high from it i actually rang

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,799
up denise cooper who's the president

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,320
in inner source commons and i was like

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
this is amazing

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,480
i don't understand why everyone isn't

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
promoting open source as a way into tech

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
because that was such a positive

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,960
experience

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,320
the community were so helpful it was

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,240
actually fun

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,480
and when i think about that and i think

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,120
about the idea that people

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,120
in ireland were able to suggest changes

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,320
to the app that made it their own

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,279
i can't but see the potential for so

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,600
many people

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,640
to have a pathway into tech and into

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,640
development

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
that doesn't rely on them going through

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,960
a computer science degree and of solving

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
all the problems that are in that system

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,039
in terms of getting

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,400
marginalized groups through education

00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,760
systems so they can get involved in the

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
tech industry

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,240
the open source community seems to

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,279
provide an opportunity for more paths in

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,480
that direction

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,039
and i think that we should exploit those

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,840
and try to investigate those as much as

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
we can

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,760
while at the same time not forgetting

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840
that work has to be done

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,080
in the open source community at the same

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,000
time to make sure that we make it as

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,559
diverse and inclusive as possible

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
and of course you know that's a problem

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,279
across the tech industry so it's a

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,919
problem everywhere

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,600
but um but the two things can be true at

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
the same time so it's another to think

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,360
scenario

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,799
and the last one i want to come to is

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,520
this idea of the

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,360
open source definition because and this

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,080
is this is probably one that you all

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
know but

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
from the outside i feel that there's

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,880
still this perception of open source as

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
just being the license so certainly

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
even even among um university

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,840
researchers that i would have talked to

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,240
who have um who are keen to actually

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,720
work

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
in the open they even get to the point

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,120
where they understand that they need to

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,039
choose a license and all the rest of it

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,520
but they don't quite understand

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,080
the concept or how to build a community

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
around the

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
about the source code that they make

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,799
open or available through open source

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,720
licenses

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,080
so there is this notion that we can

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,679
chuck it over the wall and

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,320
that's all that i need to do which of

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,400
course we all know is not the case so

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
for me there's work to be done to make

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
sure that people understand that

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,559
there are two ways to think about open

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
source there is open source as a license

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,799
the

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,640
open source code but then there are

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,159
these practices around community and

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,000
collaboration that are important

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
and i will go as far as to say that

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,799
actually this is beyond two things it's

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
actually

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,480
three things i'm flexing the whole idea

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
of two things here

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,440
but if we go to three things and think

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,440
about the idea of the open source

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,279
ecosystem itself being a complex system

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,880
and when we think about open source we

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,159
think about this idea

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
of a system and how do we support that

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,039
system

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,279
how do we create enable it how do we

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,480
create supported scaffolding

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,360
to actually help the open source

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,320
system thrive well that brings us back

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,640
to this idea

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,799
that dave snowden has introduced me to

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
which would be around the idea of

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,640
complex adaptive systems and how do we

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,679
support and scaffold them

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
when i think about that in the context

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,360
of the open source community it's how i

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,679
became

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,440
enamored with this whole idea of taking

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,080
the open source program office

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,200
concept that is so familiar in the

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,760
corporate world

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,480
and taking it to universities and taking

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
it to

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
municipalities and it's how i got

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,039
involved with moss labs

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,440
who are working on this very problem and

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,240
bringing together people who both want

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,360
to set up us pose in universities and

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,080
municipalities

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,960
but also connect those people so that

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,440
the network

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
and the sum of the individuals is is

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,399
bigger

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,720
than each some of the parts is bigger

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,559
than each individual part

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,320
so let's have a look at this idea again

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
i know that everyone here today has

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
heard a lot about

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
oscilloservices and corporate hospital

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
offices and what it can do

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,720
they typically look at everything from

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
internal policies and

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,240
and making sure that things are

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
compliant and being a center excellence

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,960
for that

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
measuring open source activity within

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,760
organizations

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,399
educating people around how to do best

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,799
practices managing relationships

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,120
um between individuals within a

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,720
corporation and perhaps foundations

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,559
and this idea of advocacy and

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
communications around the whole open

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
source movement so they'd be fairly

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,760
familiar to folks who might have been

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,200
on this um this particular

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
track in all things open

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
but if we think about ospro plus plus

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,760
this concept

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,520
is taking the idea of an ospo

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,279
bringing it to both universities and

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,799
municipalities or public sector

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,919
organizations

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,679
perhaps expanding it to include all

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,559
things open because

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
particularly in in municipalities but

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,279
also in universities these things are

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,840
broader

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,360
open source provide is a smaller part of

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,720
a bigger open discussion

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,480
so when we think about things like open

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,320
data and open hardware and open

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
standards and open innovation practices

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,120
and open scholarship

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,200
these are all things that need to be

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,520
included and taken together

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,919
and then not only are we taking that

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,360
concept and expanding it in that respect

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,480
but we're also thinking about adding in

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
this idea of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,240
it being an interface to other open

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,919
source program offices

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,159
in other universities and other

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,360
municipalities so that you have this

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
network effect

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
whereby each individual node on the

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
network

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,960
can operate as an individual node but

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
also

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,320
they're all connected so they're sharing

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
best practices

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,720
scaling what they do and also

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,600
identifying opportunities for

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,520
collaboration

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,919
that can again bring everyone forward

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,000
much quicker now that's not as common

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,360
or wouldn't be as necessary in a

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,960
corporate world where people are

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,200
thinking about it from a

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,039
you know corporation perspective but in

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,960
the public sector world in universities

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,279
and municipalities it becomes incredibly

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,200
important

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
so what would the benefits be well in my

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,039
mind it helps

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,760
to scale citizen services so i mentioned

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,559
blue tests

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,360
earlier as being the paris open source

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,000
services

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,919
that were created in paris were brought

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,679
to baltimore and implemented there so

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,480
that um you know more citizens in

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,880
baltimore could

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,399
could avail of their benefits more

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
recently i think it's been taken by

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,279
budapest

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,039
and many of the services have been stood

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,320
up in a very short period of time with

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,320
very few resources

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,520
that's what we're talking about there

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
are so many

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
big problems to solve in the world that

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,200
no one

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,960
organization could possibly do it by

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,520
themselves so why wouldn't we share that

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,039
and help scale citizen services second

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,120
thing is this idea that we mentioned

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,600
about research translation

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,120
for me the idea that we provide an

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,840
alternative path

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,039
to the traditional path of ip licensing

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,679
and monetization

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,519
is incredibly important and not just

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,919
make people aware that that is a path

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,200
but support them on taking that path and

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,000
making it an easy

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,360
default option in certain circumstances

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,320
not for everything because there will

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,159
always be

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,320
scenarios where it still makes sense to

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,919
go that more traditional route of ip

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,360
licensing that has become

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,480
so embedded in the university systems

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,440
but certainly for anything that had a

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,679
huge

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
opportunity for social good why wouldn't

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,480
you take a more open approach

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,200
it allows people to actually gain value

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,760
from that

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,440
huge amount of software that's created

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,799
within a university that is never going

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
to get licensed

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,960
and particularly when we look at speed

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
and response that needs to happen very

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,679
quickly

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,640
like for example responding to the covet

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,320
pandemic

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,200
this becomes incredibly important point

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,039
and as i mentioned i firmly believe that

00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,840
open source skills are the skills for

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,399
the future

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,360
not just to provide or to build open

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,440
source code

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
but those collaboration skills things

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,080
like conflict resolution community

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
building

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,320
and policy making everything that

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,559
surrounds the open source ecosystem

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,960
there's such important skills for a

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,120
broader set of people to have

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
and so for me when i think about

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
innovation

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,640
and i think about you know sometimes

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,039
what feels like a relatively narrow

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,760
set of skills that we are creating to

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,600
address

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,480
the opportunity that innovation can

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,799
bring i think that these

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,440
cross-disciplinary

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,360
areas that open source touches on could

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,200
really really help the whole industry if

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,600
we think about that at the broader level

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
for skills for the future

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,679
and then this idea of transparency and

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,080
trust an open source program office

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,960
in municipalities and in universities

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,440
could help

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
increase the trust the transparency

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,159
first of all

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,640
and as a result the trust that citizens

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,399
and a broader set of people have the

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,440
trust they have in technology

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,679
and that becomes so important and

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
this is cropping up all over the place i

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,880
mean it's not just in terms of

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,880
the kova tracker app that i was

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,440
mentioning earlier but this breakdown of

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,679
trust

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
between citizens and people who are

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,080
providing them the solutions that are

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
helping

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,720
to make their lives better we need to

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,320
recreate

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,159
trust we need to find other ways to

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,640
build that trust or

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,399
we'll have a scenario where where people

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,960
will reject the technology that we're

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,360
trying to

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,960
build perhaps not for them but what we

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,880
should do is build it with them

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,880
so that they feel engaged so that they

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,679
feel like they're part

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,240
of the future that is being built around

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,799
the technology industry

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,519
so i suppose i'll finish up now just to

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,080
say

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,919
um as i mentioned i'm working with moss

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,320
labs who are doing amazing work bringing

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,039
together a community of people

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,960
who are interested in setting up open

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,320
source program offices in universities

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,640
and municipalities

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,919
and they've managed to bring together an

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
amazing group of people

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,360
there are already collaborations

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
happening in that network

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,440
and between institutions i'm i'm

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,159
delighted to say that ireland

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,520
has um the liro which is the irish

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,839
software research center

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,639
has launched its own ospo and has

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,399
already

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,800
started doing joint uh proposals for

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,919
for for projects with other universities

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,760
within the network

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,599
and we're looking at skills programs we

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
can we can put in place

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,480
with collaboration from some of the

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,399
universities that are already

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
experiencing this in the us

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,839
this is an amazing opportunity for us

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
all to learn from each other

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,280
and to accelerate this whole agenda so

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,399
if you are interested

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,839
in being part of that learning more and

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,000
finding out about

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,599
whether or not this is for you or what

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
the first steps might be to take

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
then i would really encourage you to

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,679
reach out to either me on linkedin

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,159
you can actually just text here or you

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,920
can make email info at masslabs.io and
