Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: Clare is a relative newbie to the open source world. She got involved because she believes that open source is a way to construct alternative systems of innovation and remove some of the friction that is plaguing current efforts of "digital transformation". She has learned open source can help build trust, promote openness and collaboration, and provide alternative pathways to get involved with technology. As part of the OSPO++ Working Group, Clare is working with individuals and institutions in Ireland and abroad to explore how the establishment of Open Source Program Offices can help accelerate innovation in Ireland. In this session, Clare will outline the opportunities she sees for Ireland in the open source world and will share how working with the OSPO++ Working Group can help realize these opportunities.
