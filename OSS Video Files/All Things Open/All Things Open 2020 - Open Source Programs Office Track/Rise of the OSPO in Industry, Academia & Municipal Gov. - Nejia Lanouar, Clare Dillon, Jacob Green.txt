Abstract: Over the past 20 years of Open Source, a best practice has emerged involving implementation via the construct of the OSPO. This strategy has proven fruitful over and over in Industrial settings, and there's even a special affinity group of OSPO heads called the TODO Group. The best OSPOs go beyond housekeeping matters such as licensing, and extend to solve problems in the greater Open Source community through collective effort. Can Municipalities and Universities achieve their policy goals and spawn healthy open source communities through OSPOs as well? The OSPO++ Working Group believes they can, and is building a community of institutions willing to take this journey together. Learn about OSPO++ and imagine it working in your community or university.
