Description: 
	Presented by: Jacob Green, Mosslabs.io, Nejia Lanouar, City of Paris, & Clare Dillon, Moss Labs
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: Over the past 20 years of Open Source, a best practice has emerged involving implementation via the construct of the OSPO. This strategy has proven fruitful over and over in Industrial settings, and there's even a special affinity group of OSPO heads called the TODO Group. The best OSPOs go beyond housekeeping matters such as licensing, and extend to solve problems in the greater Open Source community through collective effort. Can Municipalities and Universities achieve their policy goals and spawn healthy open source communities through OSPOs as well? The OSPO++ Working Group believes they can, and is building a community of institutions willing to take this journey together. Learn about OSPO++ and imagine it working in your community or university.

of us are here today to discuss the rise

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
of open source program offices

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,519
in academia and municipal governments

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,600

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,199
jacob green which is

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,480
the founder of moss labs if i'm pointing

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
in the right direction he keeps moving

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
of the city of paris and we're here

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,880
today because

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
we have been involved in a working group

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
an international working group that's

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
actually taking place both sides of the

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,559
atlantic

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,800
with a number of universities and

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,120
representatives from government

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,879
municipalities

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,399
um and representatives from various

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,000
different open source foundations and

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
indeed corporate osbos

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
and together we've been working on this

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,640
challenge about how do we

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
actually create not just more open

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
source program offices

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
in universities and municipal

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
governments but also a network

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
of those open source uh program offices

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,560
so that we could all

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,400
collaborate better for number one

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
to have more open source in the world

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
but number two to have more

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,000
impactful open source in the world more

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
applied to open source

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
so in our presentation here today we're

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
going to

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
first of all um ask jacob and naja to

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
give us a little bit of a

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,479
background around this working group and

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,119
the whole idea how the whole idea of oz

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,159
for municipalities and academia came

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
about

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
and then after that we'll go into a

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
little bit more detail

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
about what we mean when we say uh i'll

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
suppose

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,159
in municipalities and academia so to

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,320
start us off

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
jacob nisha would you take it away to

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
give us the background of how we got to

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,439
where we are today

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
sure thank you very much claire and

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,200
thanks for all things open for the

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,840
opportunity to present today

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,320
uh all things open is a is a great thing

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
um we'll give you a little bit of

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
background about uh how how this all got

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
started

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
so we're gonna uh paint a little bit of

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,959
a picture

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,640
and but before we do we want to set the

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
stage of what are we talking about when

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,520
we say open source

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,360
there's a lot of talks today about what

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
is open source we're focusing on open

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
source as the verb

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,520
which is about the idea of how do we

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,239
collaborate together how do we use open

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,879
source

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,680
as a as a as a collaboration framework

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
to get

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,519
output and get to to get things done

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
so with every story that we want to we

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
want to tell

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,040
let's start with the cast cast of

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,800
characters and set the the the stage

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
uh here's our ingredients that we're

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
working with first of all i'd like to

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
tell you about the city of paris the

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
city of paris has a software platform

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
that

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
runs almost all of their digital

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,680
services called lutes it's open source

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
it's bsd license and 15 years in

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
development

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
uh the city of paris um is also has a

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
strong commitment to open source which

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
ninja will

as a city uh known for collaboration uh

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
and where some of the

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,560

let's take a little bit of a journey

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,680
back to december of 2018.

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
we had this idea to bring together

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
baltimore city community

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
uh leadership uh community leaders

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,440
as well as open source leaders and some

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,000
university leadership

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
to test this idea of could we rather

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
than building our own digital solutions

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
for baltimore's digital transformation

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
could we could we look to what others

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,120
have done around the world

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,160
uh the uh we've been working for a while

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,039
with phil and

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,160
and uh and pierre in the city of paris

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,960
and with neja's

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
uh blessing we brought everyone together

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,120
we all flew over to paris

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,639
and we tested the idea of open source

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
and their platform

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
uh the uh lutes to see what it could

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
offer for

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
uh citizens of baltimore out of that

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
meeting came an idea

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,199
let's have a summit let's bring together

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,240
uh global leadership around open source

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
and uh and and it was uh it was aligned

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
with the strategy

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,039
of city of paris so we started out a

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,120
recruiting tour

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
started started in first at foster of

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
that year as you can see here some of

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
the

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,039
players we were being actively included

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,800
recruited by us continue that recruiting

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
at the linux foundation leadership

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,639
summit in march of 2019

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
where a number of uh we were able to

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
have me really meaningful conversations

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
with a number of players

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
to bring them to where uh to the summit

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
for a city like paris the iit department

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,039
represents

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,280
a very important staff of 500

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,160
employees it manages software

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
engineering

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,560
deployment and maintenance of more than

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,120
1 000 applications

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,919
but also the infrastructure such as a

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,280
private data center

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,360
700 kilometer of optical fiber network

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
the telecoms and all the it equipments

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
for the

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,840
60 000 civil servants so as you can see

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,199
it's a very very important

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,960
it department and the open source policy

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:33,039
helped us to manage all these

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,720
concerns so about paris commitment

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,800
in open source policy the story began in

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,440
uh 2002 when a newly elected conceal of

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
paris

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
decided to promote an open source

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,680
strategy

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,800
and then they voted to share and to make

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
free

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
all the future open source software

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,000
developed by the city hall

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,240
they believed that public money should

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
benefit other municipalities or other

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,039
administrations

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:08,080
and therefore they wanted that citizens

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,879
would pay only once for public code

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,000
since this time the city of paris has

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,280
continuously improved its os software

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
and at the same time has been making the

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
source code

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
freely available our main development

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,400
was

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,400
the latest platform jacob just spoke

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,680
about a few minutes uh ago

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,120
and it's uh this platform

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,959
allowed us to develop more than

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,159
250 digital services

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,640
and a very very important part

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,640
of our 1000 applications

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,880
so why this commitment and why

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
an open source policy in in a

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
municipality like

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,279
paris as you probably know

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
there are several key factors which are

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,080
very important in an open source policy

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,080
the first one when you work for citizens

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,000
is trust open source establishes trust

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
and transparency between citizens and

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,279
public services

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,560
and this is very very important

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,440
especially in france then there is a

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,279
principle of

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
when we use public money we should

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,880
therefore as far as possible provide

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
public code and we also believe that

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
sharing

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
and collaborating between cities and

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,519
administrations

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
bring progress and working together

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
enables

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,760
richer smarter flexible software

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
developments

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,200
adapted to the common needs and the

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,399
common concerns of citizens

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,959
we don't want to reinvent the wheel as

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,800
we all have the same concerns and the

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,600
same needs

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,399
and if you want to be innovative we have

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
to work with

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,959
many startups because they generally use

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,839
open source today so

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,920
using open source means that we are more

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,079
flexible more independent

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,440
of the key player editors and the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,399
roadmaps

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
and sometimes we know that we have to be

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,800
realistic and we have to

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
keep a part of our information system in

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
properties

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,839
software proprietary software but

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,519
generally we try

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,440
to develop in open source code or

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,920
our applications so uh

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
in conclusion we believe that cities

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,279
have their

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,200
own means now to regain control over

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
their digital services

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,440
including cost and privacy control and

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,680
they must work together

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
in the right direction for digital

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
sovereignty

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,200
and for their independence

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,040
thank you can you tell us a little bit

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
about what your goals were for the for

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,519
the summit and uh goals going forward

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,519
for the summit of june yes yes

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,760
um after having developed many

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,279
many applications a very high number of

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
open source applications

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
we realized that it was very difficult

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,720
to share them with

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,360
other partners other administrations or

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,200
municipalities

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
and so we felt it was it was time for us

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
to

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,320
promote uh even more than before

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
our open source strategy and

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
applications and we also realized that

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,320
it was

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
it's another job it's not the same job

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
than

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,360
developing applications so uh

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,399
with the help of our partners

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,079
in the u.s in

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,519
june 2019 we hosted an event

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,639
with some of the key open source experts

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519
in the world

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
as well as municipalities to work

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,040
together

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,920
and to discuss what it would take for a

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,240
free and open

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
source software to be widely distributed

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
and used

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
we hope that this summit would give an

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,399
additional impetus to the earth

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
community

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,560
and now two years after this summit we

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
are contributing

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,079
contributing to very to various

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
workshops

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,120
collaborating with universities and we

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
begin to have more partnerships with

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
other cities in europe and

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,040
administration

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:32,399
in other countries to scale tools and to

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,000
share city service platforms

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,720
and one of the outputs was the

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,160
the concept of open source program

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,480
office

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,959
and we are working very hard on it now

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
i'm looking very forward to seeing the

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,000
open source program office thank you

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
very much neja

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
before we get into discussing more of

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,839
what open source programs are

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,279
uh we'll just wanted to uh bring it back

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
to one of the another one of the things

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
that came out of that

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
that that very memorable summit in in

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
paris at city hall

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,800
was the idea of action and the idea of

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
what can we accomplish

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
in the next five years and keeping that

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,000
as our goal

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,240
as a way to learn how to collaborate uh

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
out as part as neja said part of that

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
what came out of that summit was the

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
idea of building a

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,160
network and building these open source

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
program offices

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
as a way to allow institutions to

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
collaborate

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,200
not just developers to collaborate

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,440
developer to developer on a project

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
but the way to get open source into

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,360
municipalities at scale

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
by actually building collaboration

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
networks between the institutions and

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,079
then between the stakeholders needed

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,079
uh for that to occur we've started a

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,199
working group called the oslo plus plus

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,240
working group which we're going to get

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,320
into richard and

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
claire we pre-recorded earlier or he's

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
going to get into

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,279
but here's some of the the the outcomes

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
and some of the ospos that have been

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,040
that that have been cr

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
that have been created uh that are are

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,920
being created

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
uh because of that that summit and

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,320
there's a direct result we look forward

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,839
to more

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,519
um activity occurring before we jump

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,800
into the to the pre-recorded video

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,880
um for this we wanted to uh again

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,959
focus uh the story back to where it

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
started which was on the idea of

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,560
bringing together

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,519
uh services for the community members

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,680
for the citizens

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
it is a common goal that we that that we

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,839
share with the city of paris

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
uh um and and here in the city of

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
baltimore and

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,360
and uh working with johns hopkins and

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
other major institutions around

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,639
to facilitate that we look forward to

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
the international collaborations

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,399
that can occur while i set that up

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,160
claire would you speak to a little bit

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,839
about what's happened in in

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,600
in in ireland as as i tee up the video

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,959
thanks jacob and thanks nija i always

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
think it's fabulous to hear

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,440
the origin stories of these programs and

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
and initiatives so it's fantastic to see

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
that

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,519
and you know when you hear about the

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,360
fact that this

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,519
that everything that you have done the

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,600
the citizens are at the center of that

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,880
and and helping to accelerate innovation

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
i think that's marvelous

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,480
we in ireland uh were participating in

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
the working group as well and as a

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
result

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,360
we have a new open source program office

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,480
in liro which is the irish center for

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
software research

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
and we're hoping that by doing that

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
we're also bringing together everyone in

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,839
ireland

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
in the research community who have been

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
active in open source

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,959
and we're hoping to follow your example

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,959
and have real impact in terms of citizen

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,600
services so just to say

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,279
um there's a video about to start now uh

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
richard could unfortunately not be here

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,160
today so we wanted to bring to you

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,079
to you a description of what we mean

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,560
when we say open source program office

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
in

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
governments and cities and research

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,800
institutions so to give you a little bit

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
more detail

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
we're going to play this video to um to

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,759
go over those details and we'll come

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,279
back to you shortly

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,120
we'll be online during the video to

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
answer questions as as we play we're

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,160
going to turn off our videos and audio

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
for right now

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
hello welcome to birthman oswal plus

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,399
plus ospos for governments

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,199
cities and research institutions quite

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,199
the long title

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
it would be longer if we'd actually

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,399
spelled out ospo means open source

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,839
program office but it's probably a good

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
thing to clarify right at the beginning

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
richard

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
probably a good thing so speaking of

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,360
which claire who are you

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,440
well my name is claire dunn i'm speaking

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
to you from dublin ireland which

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
doesn't look as quite as sunny as it

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,519
does in the picture here today but i'm

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,120
delighted to be here

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,959
um and i work with moss labs

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,959
i also work with moss labs i'm rich

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,959
literal i'm calling in from

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
green vermont although it's slightly

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,199
more red and yellowish

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
now as fall has hit us and today we're

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,199
going to be talking about

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,120
open source so open source

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,199
is the future i believe if you're at

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,000
this conference you probably already

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
know this

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
um open source is the practice of

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,199
licensing your code in a way that other

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
people can use it and modify it and

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
adapt it

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
regardless of where they come from or

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,199
what they're doing and this has

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,440
generally led to a huge boom in

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,400
technology in the past 10 20 years

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,439
if not longer where now open source is

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,000
everywhere

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
so people are able to use code which

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,199
they haven't

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,400
paid for themselves to basically

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,839
accelerate

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
their work

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
and as richard has said it has

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,199
definitely been the driver of the tech

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,679
economy for the last little while

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,960
we have been seeing huge growth across

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,320
all industries

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,080
and but i think one of the most

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
interesting things about open source

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,840
in the last little while is the

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,679
emergence of new business models and

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
value streams that have been emerging

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
because

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
it's not just about the idea that um you

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
know

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
which people had this idea in the past

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
that it was about hobbyist developers

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,799
building their passion projects

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,360
but these days there's serious money in

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
open source

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
part of that service money basically has

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
to be funneled through corporate osbos

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,600
so as claire said earlier these are open

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,200
source program offices

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,039
and essentially if you have a large

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,799
like enterprise you need to have someone

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
who is managing what open source means

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,240
to that company

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
so these are the sort of six roles that

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,440
you have

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
within a corporate ospo and they do all

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
of these things

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
first you have policy experts people who

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,600
are really good at deciding

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,679
what policy is going on what what

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
license we want to use how do we do that

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,039
how do we

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,799
integrate our ideology of open source to

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,400
our company and collaborate other people

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,760
then you have compliance and legal well

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
are we making sure we don't have any gpl

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
licenses down the stack or making sure

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,919
that we're not treading on anyone else's

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
patent toes

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,120
how are we going to do that and then

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,039
another job that the corporate

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,480
ospo has is measurement of open source

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
activity right so

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,000
how much open source we actually have at

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,360
this company how much are our developers

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,559
doing this in their spare time

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
how much are we working with other

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
people what other open source projects

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
do we depend upon

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,360
claire can you talk about the next three

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,080
points yeah i mean

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,160
alongside all the above the open source

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,280
program office also looks at educating

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,440
the developers about

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,360
open source uh coding the development

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,039
practices the tools

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,120
the legal issues that we've mentioned

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,360
above also they're often involved in

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,640
i suppose being the interface to the

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
various different open source

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,799
foundations

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,720
or the various different um institutions

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,000
that they may have to work with in order

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
to actually do their job and they're

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
also involved in this idea of

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,640
being an advocate for open source within

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,039
the organization

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,559
and providing communications around

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,480
their activities so that people

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,679
understand what's happening in open

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,360
source in these institutions

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,360
but i think when we think about osco

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,799
plus plus we want to go

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
a little bit further because that

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,160
construct has worked incredibly well

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,840
in corporations and in fact the linux

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
foundation and the to do group have done

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,520
an awful lot of work to help

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
organizations understand what they look

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
like and to get best practices around

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
this

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,919
but when we start to think about taking

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,320
that oscar construct

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,919
and actually bringing it to cities and

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,200
governments and universities

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,400
it can often look a little different

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
so part of that is you have to think

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
about other institutions cities and you

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,520
know governments and so on

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,960
and how do they have oz pose right what

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,200
does a university oscar

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,640
look like obviously it's going to be

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,720
slightly different you don't have just a

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
management structure that's hierarchical

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,720
um it's much harder to make things move

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
fast in university settings we all know

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
and we'll get to more of the differences

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,559
later but

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
for now think about this idea of well

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,760
what would it look like for a city for a

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,520
government et cetera

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,799
um part of that is that oscillos don't

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,799
just cover source code

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,640
they also cover all sorts of other open

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,240
things open asterisks as i like to call

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,159
it right open data

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,799
uh open finance for some like ngos

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,760
um open hardware open scholarship how do

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,159
you make sure that academics are getting

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
citations for their work and getting

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,919
recognized for it

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,080
there's a whole ton of things that go on

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
in that sort of setting

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,600
but the main thing that we want to talk

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,280
about is the plus plus for ospo right

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
for corporations you have just a single

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
ospo that runs that corporation maybe

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
they collaborate maybe they don't

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,039
the universities and cities and

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,799
governments these are institutions that

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,960
are based around community principles

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,559
from the get-go and so we think instead

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
of just having an ospo there we should

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,600
have

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,840
a collaborative network of osbos that

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,159
interface with other hospitals

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,039
and have a really structured way of

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,320
sharing

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,080
all the advances we have with open

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
source and how to build us both so that

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,960
they can keep their costs down

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,240
while magnifying their effect and it's

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
really important because

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
even as we talked about the value of

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
open source earlier

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,320
when we think about that in the context

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,799
of

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,919
cities or regional governments or

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,919
universities

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,840
none of them can do what needs to be

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,159
done to solve the world's problems alone

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
so you know in many respects you know

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,039
it's fine when you're thinking about

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
building the code that your company is

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
going to be commercially dependent on

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
but when you're thinking about solving

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,559
the world's problems

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
you kind of got to work together around

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,600
that so this idea of being able to

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
collaborate becomes

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,679
much much more important when we think

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,000
about these constructs in a public

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
setting

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
so we just talked about collaboration a

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,280
lot but

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,600
why now in particular well

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,280
we think there's a couple of reasons not

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
regarding the huge amount of political

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
stuff happening in the states at the

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
moment

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
there are other global challenges that

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
can be met through collaborating between

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,039
ospos

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,720
great example would be climate change

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,640
there's a ton of work which is going on

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
into climate change which is open source

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
and if we collaborate on that it means

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,440
people don't have to keep reinventing

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,480
the wheel and that's a time-sensitive

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
issue

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,600
claire do you want to talk about social

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,200
impact yeah you know this is a passion

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
point from my perspective because

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,240
you know i i came to the open source

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,480
community and

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
i had already heard so much about the

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
idea of um

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
open source accelerating how you how you

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,120
build software

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,799
and the various different value around

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
that but for me one of the most

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
important things is this

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
idea that open source can help build

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,000
trust and with the users of the

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,039
technology and a great example of this

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,840
is um ireland's covert tracker app which

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,360
when it was built um in collaboration

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,960
between the health service executive

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,559
and a company called near form in

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,720
ireland when they built that they

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,840
decided to open source the code

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,840
in order to allow privacy experts to

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360
examine the code and give it a thumbs up

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,480
so that no one was going to say oh the

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,159
government is tracking my

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
my you know my whereabouts and all the

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,679
rest of us and they did that

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
and as a result it had one of the

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
fastest take-ups of any app of this kind

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,280
in the world

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
and like that had a dramatic immediate

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,480
effect on ireland's ability to actually

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,799
combat this disease so

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,240
it's it's just such a an important thing

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,799
these days because

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,760
trust between citizens and governments

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,440
and it's so

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
important when we think about digital

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,279
transformation that people get on board

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,840
with the technology that is being built

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,679
and maybe that it should be feeling like

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,760
it's a little bit more transparent

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,200
and trustworthy and open source gives

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,480
you that which i think is incredibly

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
important

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,240
and as a result actually i think that

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
there have been a lot of public policy

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,640
changes that have been happening in the

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,400
last while

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
and for the reasons we've already

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,720
mentioned because of the potential

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,320
commercial benefits or commercial impact

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,559
because it builds trust

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
but also in places like europe there's a

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,720
lot of conversation that's happening

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,039
around

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
um tech independence or or at least

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,559
removing the risk

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,679
of being dependent on any one

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,000
corporation

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,039
or country and this brings us back to

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,159
the collaboration

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,200
i mean really when we think about when

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,240
we're investing

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,760
public money in in creating the software

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,840
that's going to help us get

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,520
the future and it's really about this

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
idea that we should all be doing this

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,760
together

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,679
and we should all be equal partners in

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,960
this so there's a lot of public policy

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
discussions that are going on at the

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,760
moment

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,559
and all around the world about making

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,559
that a reality

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,600
so one of the questions then is going

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
back to the previous point what does an

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
asphalt look like what does an osmo plus

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,320
plus look like

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
uh when it's at a university setting

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,360
when it's in a governmental setting

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,559
or you know in a city so one of the

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
first things that an hospital needs to

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,520
do there is

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
do an assessment of the ecosystem first

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,000
where is it

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,320
compared to other universities or other

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,600
cities or the governments and secondly

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,559
what's going on in its purview with its

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,679
citizenry

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,760
so if you have say a city which has an

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
osbo you need to see what city services

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,520
can be offered that are open source what

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,760
open source code is already being used

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,600
uh are there people from your city which

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,799
are doing open source which could be

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,880
brought in somehow or

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
supported which is one of the other main

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
points right how do you support

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,000
academics you work with it at your

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,919
institution for making open source

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
code how do you support students who are

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,240
doing that how do you support

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
translation and resource discrimination

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,080
and making sure that

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
their work gets out properly a lot of

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
people who write code aren't very good

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
marketers

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
right so an hospital should be part of

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,480
that as well

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,760
relationships and interface how do you

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
interface with other cities

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,520
right how do you make sure that your

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
code doesn't just live with you and just

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,159
open source

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
is put out there and nothing happens to

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,279
it one of the ways you do that is you

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,279
have collaborations

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,320
how do you make sure that that works

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,480
that's kind of the job of an oz po there

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,600
and similarly to what we described in

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,440
the corporate hospital

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
looking at the skills required and

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,880
recognizing that the skills required

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,720
in the context of a city or a government

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
or university may be different than that

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,000
in a corporate context so therefore we

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,320
have to look at the skills

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
and again the awareness of the activity

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,640
and and making sure that people

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,200
understand what's happening

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
i mean these these are fairly similar to

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
the various

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,360
themes that we had in the corporate

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
hospital but maybe now richard we can go

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,840
into

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,080
what they may look like in the specific

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,360
context of both the university

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,799
and the the municipal aspects

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,279
so let's look at the university oscar

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,279
plus class

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,799
sounds good to me first one obviously is

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,320
research right universities are known

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
for doing a lot of research girls known

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,120
for education

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,400
so we'll get to that second but research

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,159
is one of the main things we're all

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
supposed to do really really well

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
especially for organizations or

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
universities which

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,559
have a large research arm right you want

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
to make sure that that's getting out

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,720
there and that things are actually

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,559
changing in the world this is great for

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,799
both the academics and the funders

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,640
and the university administration

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,200
everyone kind of wins here

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,159
um translation and dissemination is also

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,919
part of that

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
right so there's often a very large

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,320
section of the university that's just

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,919
called translation

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,120
that's just one of the main goals of the

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,679
administration is making sure that the

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
work that's

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,919
being done there has an impact on the

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
world and so being able to amplify and

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,159
accelerate voices within the university

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,440
is one of like

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,000
the core parts of the university osbos

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,799
education and skills if i can interrupt

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,200
you there richard

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,200
we've heard from people in universities

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
like for example syed chowdhury who

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,159
is the director of the open source

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
program office in johns hopkins

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
university

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,080
and he talks a lot about this idea that

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,640
um

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,240
that that artifact that results of

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
research that is software

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
is such a valuable thing but so many

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,799
universities

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,520
only measure their ability to monetize

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,240
ip

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,760
around that software and if you only do

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,679
that you're only going to get a small

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,640
percentage of all the available software

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,440
that might be available in the

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,039
university

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,799
but if you think about the idea that

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,360
that software could actually have

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,320
an impact even if it isn't got even if

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,960
it hasn't got

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
an immediate monetary value and it could

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,559
still have an impact

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
and therefore it's another pathway for

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,720
universities to be able to translate

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,080
that research into impact

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,919
of course part of making sure that your

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,919
translation is working is also

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,440
working with future translation efforts

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,279
which means training

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,480
current students to be able to do open

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,399
source effectively

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,240
and not just open source code we already

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,600
have that in say our cs programs

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,799
but also training people to run ospos at

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
universities

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,919
building the next generation of leaders

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
who are good at

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,399
you know purveying open source gospel

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,919
around the world

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760
also a very important part of the

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,120
corporate osprey

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
also a very part of the university

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
ospose which we need to think about when

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,159
we think about what it looks like

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,080
and back to having social impact and

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,799
local impact for universities

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,760
so often the universities have a

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,399
priority

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,399
to make sure that they are giving a

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,679
benefit back to whatever community they

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,240
actually exist in

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,520
and we know that the the programs around

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,200
open source program offices and

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,840
universities can often have that as a

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
goal

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,200
and again looking to johns hopkins

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
there's a wonderful example they have

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,559
there of the work that they have done

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,640
with saint francis neighborhood centers

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,360
in baltimore's uh city center

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,960
where they've taken open source code and

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,960
with the students getting involved

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,120
they've actually been able to

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
have real impact on the ground with

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
software that

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,279
those neighborhood centers wouldn't

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,880
ordinarily be able to access

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,480
and do it in super quick time because

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
they were able to collaborate using open

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,120
source

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,720
so it's a fantastic way for for

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,960
universities to be able to have

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,440
a real immediate social impact in their

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
environment

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,279
and for funding too in terms of actually

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,640
the the oscar being a center for being

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,880
able to interface with

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,200
with the various other ospos and with

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,039
institutions and with funding bodies per

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
se as well because with all the public

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,520
policy changes that is happening

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,320
around open source there is a lot more

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,760
funding available that has this explicit

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,240
stipulation that the

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,880
end result has to be open and in that

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,120
respect

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,320
and osmo plus plus can actually identify

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
those funding opportunities

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,799
and even create joint submissions and

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,559
within a network

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
so that so that universities can go

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,240
after that so um

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
it can be an important focal point for

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
actually bringing funding into a

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
university

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,440
so that covers all suppose of the

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,559
university level municipal levels are

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,080
slightly different

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,279
but also kind of the same that's why

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
we're putting them both under the

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,399
hospital plus plus

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,919
heading one of the things that's really

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,799
important for cities

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,919
as opposed to say universities um where

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,360
it's also important too

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,159
don't get me wrong but it's really

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,880
important to have transparency and trust

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,679
um are modern democracies for those of

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,240
us who are in

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
awesome democracies depend upon trust

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,120
and citizen services depend upon the

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,559
citizens knowing that their vote matters

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
and that their politicians are looking

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,600
out for them

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,880
in some way now this is kind of at the

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
ideological level

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,519
uh often it doesn't really seem that way

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
if you ask the average person on the

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
street

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,960
do you trust your government well no not

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,039
really but

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,120
with open source that's particularly

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
true and it really helps this whole

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,679
process along

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,440
clara made a really good example earlier

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,440
about the cobit tracing app

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
in ireland which was a government's

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,120
initiative right

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,640
and by being open source they were able

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,679
to engender trust in the populace

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,039
because people were like oh yeah that

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,120
looks pretty good we haven't had a ton

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,960
of security experts saying this is awful

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,799
or if they did say that we worked in

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,279
those bugs very early

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,039
go ahead claire i have another one and i

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,679
was speaking earlier about the

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,880
the work that johns hopkins has done in

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,600
saint francis neighborhood centers in

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,039
baltimore

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,880
i remember being part of one of the

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,000
events in baltimore where they were

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,559
talking about

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
um the ability for citizens to get

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
engaged

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,559
in that software and to actually have

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,640
the accessibility to

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,000
to kind of make changes to that software

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,600
can really help

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,440
uh change how the citizens feel about

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,640
their relationship with the technology

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,799
providers because i

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,760
there was one phrase that really stuck

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,919
with me

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,799
one of the participants said we feel

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,600
often like

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,760
like technology is being done for us but

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
actually we want it to be done with us

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,960
and i think that that's such an amazing

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,679
way to look at how

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,559
open source can be employed by municipal

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,240
and governments

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,600
and municipalities and governments

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,120
because really

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,559
if we want citizens to get engaged

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,640
with the future and digital

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,399
transformation then then giving them the

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,559
opportunity to see what's going on

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,440
and even maybe participate in that

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,399
community

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,039
is is a huge benefit which segregates

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,480
right into

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,080
point two which is scaling municipal

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
services um

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,120
loot tess is an open source platform

00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
that's used to do participatory

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,039
budgeting

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,960
so that citizens can actually decide

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,480
where budgets go this is used by the

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,080
city of paris at the moment as well as

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
budapest in baltimore

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,399
so it's a trans country transcontinental

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
thing which is open source

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
and allows people to actually say we

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,519
need more garbage collectors in our

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,039
around the swim right

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,559
and so people have actually said that

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,480
they feel more

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,840
like they're part of the system like

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,039
they're actually doing something that

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
matters and that they can see real

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,799
changes on the governmental level

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
which from a european perspective is

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,159
amazing because that isn't something

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
that people often say

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
and that that example of the test is a

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,039
brilliant one because it was actually

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,919
the foundation of the work that was done

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
in baltimore

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,919
but i've heard that recently it's

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
actually been taken and and it's been

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,600
implemented now in budapest as well so

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
when we think about scaling these

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
municipal services it's not just

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,640
even on the ground in the cities where

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
they're created but

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,960
then that source code can actually be

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,880
used around the world very quickly with

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
with low effort and resources can be

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
reused

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,720
and for great again great benefits for

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,039
the citizens which isn't

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,120
and when when the new citizens see it

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,039
working in a previous city it can really

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,320
really help us get off the ground even

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,919
quicker

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,200
it also help with policies you know

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,720
policies used in one city are often

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,359
adaptable to another one

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,000
so it really scales that out which means

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,720
less money

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
less time just movement and progress

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,119
going forward

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,040
and involving the citizenry which is

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,240
excellent also makes it much

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,480
go ahead it also helps to have

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,079
um you know some expertise in the

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,200
municipal osbo around

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,839
policy development because so often uh

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,560
people like these ideas but don't really

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,800
understand

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,679
the practical steps that they may have

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
to go through

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
in order to make them a reality so one

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,240
of the real core competencies

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
that's very particular to a municipal

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,159
osbo

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,520
um is is that ability to understand

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,240
how to make policies real um and how how

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,399
to use

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,079
the osbo as an instrument to make that

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,680
policy real and impactful within a city

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,400
also how to influence and advocate other

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
cities and more collaborations and make

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
sure that there's someone there who is

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
actually being a champion for open

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,599
source

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,960
that's part of the point of the osbo to

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
hold a vessel for these people to do

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,160
their work

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,440
so that open source code can really help

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,000
people out

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,440
but there's also a lot of food or fear

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
uncertainty or doubt that still

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,480
lingers in the system around open source

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,760
and you know

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,920
um i i i kind of you're very you're very

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,680
aware that some of the stories that were

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,359
surrounding you know the narratives that

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,400
were surrounding open source from say

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,240
20 years back are still prevalent today

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,640
when when people who are not familiar

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
with

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
the great advances that have happened in

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,640
this ecosystem if they're not familiar

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,480
with those

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,160
they still think that it's a group of

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,880
hobbyists who are

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,720
building whatever their their hobbyist

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,359
projects but they they're not probably

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,960
aware

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,119
of the amazing and structure and

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,880
the maturity of the whole open source

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,320
ecosystem so it's it's incredibly

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
important to have someone

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,000
who can watch out for that and then to

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,160
be provide this again

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,160
center of excellence for understanding

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,720
uh where the open source community has

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,040
come

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,040
to and and help share that news

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,680
part of influencing and advocating for

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,880
open source and osbos in general is of

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,960
course telling stories

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,400
so i run a podcast called impactful open

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,760
source where i look at these stories of

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,480
how source code has gone through

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,200
cities governments organizations ngos

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
etc

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,400
particularly through osbos and the

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,320
oswell plus plus network

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,000
um and shows where open source has

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,680
actually made a real change in the world

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,440
so we're actively trying to collect

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,800
these stories if you have some i would

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,200
love to hear them

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
and the goal there is to make it easier

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,680
for everyone else to say

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,680
all suppose exist and we should have one

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,160
at our city

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,119
which is exactly what we said in ireland

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,760
um so

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
i'm i'm very happy to share that in

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,320
ireland

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
lyra which is the irish software

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,119
research center and

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,720
has formed a new ospo and is part of the

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,040
ospro plus plus network

00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,760
um and it's very new in ireland and

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,240
we're still

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,920
working around what that will look like

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,720
but we've already had

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,440
the first meetings of that ospo plus um

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,560
group with the researchers in ireland

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
that are interested in this and it's

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,960
already

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,880
using results where where the

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
researchers involved were able to share

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,160
their challenges and share best

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,720
practices around this so

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,359
it becomes immediately apparent of the

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,440
value

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
of having a central point for

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
researchers to gather around and tell

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,359
their stories

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,960
and hopefully we'll get to be on the

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,960
podcast uh soon richard

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,079
you will be uh one of my first guests

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
was actually syed chowdhury who you

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,680
mentioned earlier who is

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,440
running the osfo at johns hopkins he's

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,119
done amazing work there

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,119
particularly with copit actually they

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,560
built a wonderful atlas of

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,160
what's happening with cobit during the

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,320
world which was a collaborative

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,359
open source effort so we talk about that

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,280
on the podcast

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,079
and also he's just a great example of

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,240
how to build an hospital at a university

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
another great story of ospo's coming out

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,119
of the osbo plus plus network

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,040
is open at rit with stephen jacobs rit

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,880
is a fairly large university in upstate

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,560
new york that does a ton of research

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,800
and stephen jacobs has set up there the

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,359
first real program for teaching students

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,359
how to do

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,960
open source and also getting them jobs

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,599
and collaborative efforts and

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
making sure that it fosters the whole

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,160
culture of open source at the university

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
level

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,000
and works with other universities as

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,560
well right so he's been working together

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,200
with

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,800
saeed and others in hospital plus plus

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,720
so it makes it easier for him to get

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
this off the ground

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,079
probably one of the better examples of

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,480
this as well is cross

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,440
cross is the center for open source

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,720
research

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,640
at uc santa cruz uh run by carlos

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,040
maltsson and ceppeliji

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,280
stephanie legion and what they've done

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,119
is they got a large grant from sage weil

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,680
who runs seth which is a large storage

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,680
program and that grant allows them to

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,079
actually foster graduate students

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,119
to work on the work that they want to do

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,079
with help

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,560
and funds from corporate sponsors so

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,960
that

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,240
at the end of their you know phd they

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,839
have a job waiting for them because

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,640
they've already been doing open source

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,359
the entire time so how do you combine

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,320
together

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,800
academia with research uh cross is a

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,599
great example of this

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,000
another one would be brandeis go ahead

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
no no

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,320
not only is it a great example of what

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,680
you can do within the university but

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,320
um i think even back to the point of uh

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,680
how you can get investment through your

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,079
activities in open source

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,880
um one of the other reasons why cross is

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,800
incredibly

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
uh great story is that they are cash

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,880
positive i believe so

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,800
um it's it it's marvelous to see uh such

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,000
an initiative actually be able to get a

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,880
return on investment

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,880
from their activities

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
speaking of returns on investment

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,359
brandeis right now is running the first

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,560
basically ospo plus plus training camp

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,760
where they have a program at the

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,880
university to teach

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,720
people how to become heads of osbos

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,320
um it's very easy to find you know open

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,320
source courses or a professor who

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,160
teaches open source or

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,760
a way of doing that at a university

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,119
level in a sense of like having a

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
student who likes open source can be

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,200
supported in some way ad hoc

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,240
it's very hard to find a university

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
that's dedicated

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,000
from the administration down from the

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,760
courses down in teaching people

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,440
how to open source in the future

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,280
brandeis is the first of this

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,119
and it's super exciting to watch them

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,839
investing in the entire ecosystem

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,839
from the get-go

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,119
which is what we're doing at odds well

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,400
plus plus so we're trying to make sure

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,160
that we hold the space for people to

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
have these conversations around what

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,800
osbos are

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,560
how to work together collaboratively and

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,440
how to do it at the city level you know

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,680
government level

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,480
and how to effectively strategize to do

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,400
that effectively

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,400
i think some of the learnings that have

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,280
happened uh from the oscar plus plus

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,760
working group

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
have already been incredibly helpful for

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,400
anyone who's starting up

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,920
their own ospo or in fact even

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,520
a long way down the road because

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,960
everyone has unique challenges and the

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,319
sharing has been incredible

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,079
and but one of the things that i have

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,440
found again

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,359
incredibly um impressive is is that we

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,880
we're already seeing collaborations

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,680
coming out from this work group it's

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,359
only been in place

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,599
a couple of months but we've had uh

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,599
joint funding uh proposals

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,640
in place and there are discussions going

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,319
on now for

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,400
collaborations across curriculum

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,880
development and skills programs

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,560
and so i think it's a it's a marvelous

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,440
working group to be part of

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,480
um and i hope we can find some more

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,640
great participants

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,480
um from this plot from this presentation

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,920
and richard it probably would be a good

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
idea for us to actually share

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,520
how people can actually get in contact

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,440
with us if they want to find out more

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,800
most likely send an email to info at
