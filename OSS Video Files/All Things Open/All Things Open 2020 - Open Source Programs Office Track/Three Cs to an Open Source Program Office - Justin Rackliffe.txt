Abstract: When we are trying to formalize our organizational strategy around using and participating in open source we may need to dedicate resources. What can be challenging is how we communicate the need and motivation around that commitment. Justin Rackliffe has found a few points that have helped him communicate his value to technical and non-technical partners around the organization.

Compliance - How do we meet our corporate responsibilities based around internal policies and practices with an emphasis on automation and minimal bureaucracy.

Community - How can we work across silos internally and externally to scale our efforts that focus on customer value

Character - How is Fidelity perceived in the open source community and how can we increase our visibility with direct investment in consortia that help make us successful.
