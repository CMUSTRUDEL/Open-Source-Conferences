	Presented by: Justin Rackliffe, Fidelity Investments
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Source Programs Office Track

Abstract: When we are trying to formalize our organizational strategy around using and participating in open source we may need to dedicate resources. What can be challenging is how we communicate the need and motivation around that commitment. Justin Rackliffe has found a few points that have helped him communicate his value to technical and non-technical partners around the organization.

Compliance - How do we meet our corporate responsibilities based around internal policies and practices with an emphasis on automation and minimal bureaucracy.

Community - How can we work across silos internally and externally to scale our efforts that focus on customer value

Character - How is Fidelity perceived in the open source community and how can we increase our visibility with direct investment in consortia that help make us successful.

thank you very much

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
um hope everybody's having an awesome

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,040
time

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,840
at the event i know it's definitely not

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,839
what

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,560
we would like it to be but hey we're

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,760
doing doing what we can

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
so again this is first year for the open

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
source program office track

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
um so hopefully you've seen some great

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
material there

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,760
as well as the business track um

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm guessing anybody who's kind of

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
coming to this session

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
has it on their mind that they're

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
thinking about trying to do something

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
more strategic with open source

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
in their organization so both those

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
tracks are going to make a whole lot of

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,680
sense

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
and if you miss sessions i know a lot of

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
them they're all going to be recorded

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
and thrown up on youtube

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,879
so just give it a little bit of time and

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
todd and team will make that happen for

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,840
you

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
um so a little bit of background who am

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800
i um

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,960
so justin ratcliff that's already been

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,560
been mentioned

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,000
i am the open source program office lead

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,840
at fidelity investments um

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
one of some of the primary stuff i do is

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,680
i interface with linux foundation

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,119
um i am a member of the to do group

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
again that's probably been a common

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,600
theme if you've been in any of the

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
sessions

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
you've been hearing that name come up a

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,080
lot and it's really around open source

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,200
program office

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,479
leads and members and those related to

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,560
it

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
trying to learn from each other bouncing

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
ideas off each other

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,880
and generally a pretty cool place to

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
hang out

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,240
and how i kind of define my role is

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
helping associates with infidelity do

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,840
some awesome things with open source

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
and to recognize as a share of

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
responsibility

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,040
we're all going to have to figure this

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
out together

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
this is not going to be some giant

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
bureaucracy or anything along those

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
lines

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,640
and this is a virtual thing i am in

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
north carolina i am in

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,440
triangle park i live in kerry so

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,040
normally this is kind of a fun event for

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
me because i get to

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,120
drive to the event and then go home and

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,920
see my family

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,239
so a little bit bummed although the

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,879
weather is phenomenal outside

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,920
um so what we're gonna make do

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,080
um and just a lens

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,599
um that is just a reality for me

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
um there's a bias uh because i'm a

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,400
regulated party

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
because of the history of fidelity

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
because of a whole lot of things

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
um some of the things that i'll

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,360
emphasize in this

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,200
talk reflect kind of where i sit in the

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
industry or my organization sits in the

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,959
industry

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,599
and so for for me i have a bias

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,159
towards things around compliance things

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,360
around

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,080
regulations and policies and

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
contributing

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,319
upstream as opposed to releasing works

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
but they're all important um

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
but just to know that that every every

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
organization is gonna be a little

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,360
different um and

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,480
that is come on

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,720
are you why aren't you moving

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,560
of course let's try that nope

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,280
there it is um so why are you here

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
um why are you at an event about open

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,159
source

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,480
well because it's important uh every

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,360
there's so many surveys that go out talk

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
about the the criticality of open source

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
how much of our commercial enterprise

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
depends on open source

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,720
um these things are just they're

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
essential they're part of how we do

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,280
business now

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
and when 80 90 of the code base that

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,599
you're dealing with

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,159
whether it's a cloud service or

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,959
some other product capability

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,519
that you're pulling off of github it's

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
all going to be open source

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,720
and again there's a whole lot of

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,639
benefits to undifferentiated heavy

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
lifting

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
but there's some responsibilities that

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
we all have to be aware of

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,400
and i think more and more organizations

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,600
are figuring out that

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
this isn't just a passive thing you can

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,160
get into trouble

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,720
um i would say another thing was

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
if you're not clear with your developers

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,040
they're going to be risk averse

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
especially in these this day and age

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
they don't want to do things that put

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
their career in jeopardy

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,960
so they may be less willing to innovate

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,000
less willing to experiment

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,520
and we have to recognize

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,759
as organizations that it's important

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
to put policies in the foot process in

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
place

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,479
that allows people to feel free

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,240
feel free to collaborate feel free to to

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,240
be involved and to do cool things

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,039
and that organizations do have their

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,520
responsibilities too

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,160
so we have to be able to be there to to

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
meet those

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,880
there it is um again

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,680
the goal of the ospo at least for me

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,560
is to enable inspire and catalyze teams

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800
to do

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
better things to make that next best

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
choice

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
um but also educating them in their

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,400
responsibilities

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
it's key education will always be a

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
stream for the open source program

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
office

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
in in some ways it's a moving target as

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
well

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,199
the things that you had to learn um a

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,759
couple years ago

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,039
as we looked at big events from apache

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
struts

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,680
with other financial parties and

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,520
people's personal data

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,960
are very different than maybe a

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,039
container thing or a cloud thing

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
so it becomes this very evolving

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,199
narrative

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,919
that is responsive to your organization

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
based around

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,440
where they're at um

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
so what are you going to get out of this

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
i always have a firm belief that you

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
need to be able to get if you're going

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
to spend your time

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
if your your organization is gonna

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
invest time

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
um what are you gonna get out of this so

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
my goal is three handles i call them

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
three c's because

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,759
everybody likes a little little hook um

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,759
to help frame a discussion around

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,759
open source to do an elevator pitch

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,240
and basically on on

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,919
how you want to take that message and

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
refine it in a way that makes sense it

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
makes sense to your manager it makes

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,919
sense to your execs

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
it makes sense to any of the

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,840
stakeholders from your security or

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,759
legal or purchasing organizations that

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,759
you're going to have a conversation with

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,080
so uh call out to yesterday matt uh

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
assay's uh

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,319
keynote um and called on uh

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,759
simon wardley's uh quote around jevin's

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
paradox

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
this is a common tripping point a lot of

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
people think that

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
open source or or software is a zero-sum

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,080
game

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,080
and that's the evidence that it's not

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
the more that we can invest in this kind

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,319
of

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,280
this core thing that we call open source

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
the larger the marketplace the more

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
participants

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
the more innovation and we need to be

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
able to

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
to be able to start that to get that

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,080
message across to those who

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,479
who are the decision makers in our

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400
organization and commonly the open

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,840
source program office becomes that

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,080
that voice or a voice

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,720
that that takes developer

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
responsibilities and industry trends

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,560
around open source and turns them into

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,360
uh business statements that make sense

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,800
to the organization in question

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,240
um one thing to always remember

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,039
every organization has a different

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,319
culture it has a heritage it has a story

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,160
that is unique to that organization um

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,440
and it needs to be reflected in your in

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
your proposal

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
because you're not trying to solve the

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,639
solve things forever

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,120
you're maybe six months out one year out

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,919
you'll continually learn and refine this

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
message

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,159
um and potentially grow that that role

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
and responsibility

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
um it's very it's be very cautious on

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,519
copy pasting

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,200
culture i don't find it works pretty

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,560
very well

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
because it just doesn't it creates a

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,519
little bit of rejection within the

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
organization because it's not

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,560
organic it didn't come from them so the

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,680
the three c's are designed to be

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
prescript to not be prescriptive but to

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
be

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
descriptive so you're not going to find

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
a checklist here

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,839
that's going to be able to answer the

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,440
questions but hopefully just give you a

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
little bit of framework and a few

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
handles

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,640
to get things moving around

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,320
so this is everybody's favorite and

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
coming from a regulated space

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
um it's it's kind of the one that i wear

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,839
on my head most of the time

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,080
oftentimes it's where people start

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,120
compliance and it could have been some

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
some newspaper thing some big

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
vulnerability

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
um and then the executive team comes

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,279
down and says

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,680
where are we with this and again it's a

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
very

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,080
risky risk averse approach or a risk

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,360
motivated approach

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,640
um a little bit of fear that's there

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,279
but we all start somewhere um sometimes

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,320
fear can be a good motivator it gets

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
people moving

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,519
it helps them understand that things are

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,480
important

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,000
um the ospo can be there a lot of times

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
can be a response to this

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,880
but it can be there to take that that

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,920
initial kind of knee-jerk reaction

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,920
and then not just resolve that

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,959
not just kind of handle it make it feel

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
comfortable

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,540
but also to then catalyze this thing to

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,760
move forward

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,519
[Music]

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,760
to start disrupting things

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,600
so what we want to be able to do is

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,959
when we've talked about usage

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,040
consumption of open source

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
we'll start there and we'll help to

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
refine that make sure there's a

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,320
licensing policy

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,839
make sure there's an open source policy

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
we'll start to provide

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
framework for the developers to do

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,600
things well and then

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,279
for us to measure it so that we can go

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
back to our auditors

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
and show them that yeah we are doing

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,120
things well um

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
and let them feel comfortable

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,120
i was let's go um

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,640
one of the kind of key things that can

00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
kind of be lost in the compliance

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
mindset

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
is when you're doing some of this work

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,519
uh john mark kind of called this off

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,839
in the previous session when you're

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,880
scanning you're understanding your

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
your portfolio um sometimes that data

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,160
just

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,560
that just data just ends up in security

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,800
or it ends up in legal

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,399
and people check licenses or they check

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,640
public vulnerabilities or something like

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
that

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
one thing that you can definitely use

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,200
this data for

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,560
is helping to build consensus

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,320
make this data available um

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,040
i kind of i always frame this around

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
like an amazon shopping cart

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
uh we're all going out there we're all

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
trying to find something and also

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
we're exposed to what other people have

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
selected

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
and what other people thought of the

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
things that they selected

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
and what that may do is they may guide

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,440
us in certain directions

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,079
now again we're not buying a spatula but

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
picking out an npm package might be in

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
that same space

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,560
it might feel that way it's very

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,440
utilitarian

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,279
um so if you can say hey this this

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
package looks a lot like this one or

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,200
it's from this ecosystem

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
or your business unit might have these

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
priorities

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,720
and want to be playing in this ecosystem

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,959
more than another one

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,320
making that data availability available

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,079
to your developers is

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,519
very important it allows them

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,600
to kind of build these communities

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,440
organically they can reach out

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,160
and build relationships um and

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,000
it also allows them because we're all a

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
little bit risk-averse especially these

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
days

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,000
it allows them to see where the the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,519
thing that they found

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,800
may not have the best track record or

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
um in a financial services area is to

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
buy

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,079
hold or sell is this is this project

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,959
growing

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,240
um dawn foster did a great uh discussion

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
in the business track

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,680
around kind of the the health of

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,120
ecosystems

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,399
and health of communities and

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,240
how that can influence risk so what we

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,160
want to be able to do is to direct is

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,639
kind of nudge people

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
and nudge their developers in in good

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,760
directions

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,639
help them make the best choice you don't

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,839
you don't want to focus on gates or

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,959
bureaucracy

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,079
to try to control things um it doesn't

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,320
end up well

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,760
i tend to be a lot of shadow i.t at that

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,680
point

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,800
the focus should be around guard rails

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,760
helping people

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
avoid driving off a cliff but they still

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
need to drive the car

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
there's still some responsibilities

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
there and being clear with your

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,959
motivations

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,399
on why this thing made sense

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,800
and on the bureaucracy side i'm an open

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,399
source program office of one

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
the session following this one which i'm

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,839
also in um

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,720
we'll talk about kind of the diversity

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,720
of open source program offices

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
maybe it's because i'm in a kind of

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,519
mature organization

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,720
um i have a adverse reaction to heavy

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,120
bureaucracy but it doesn't mean that

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,519
i can do everything but it what it means

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,760
is i build my networks

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
so i have my relationships with legal

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,079
with procurement

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,760
with audit any of the organizations

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,360
um i build partnerships with so that way

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
it doesn't become the faceless

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
bureaucracy

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,839
but but something that's a network of

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,959
relationships that i can send people to

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,839
and pull people in it helps keep things

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,600
lean

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
helps keep things responsive to the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
changes in organizational priorities

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
and not just kind of this open source

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
silo

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,720
so the next city community

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,760
in any organization unless you're really

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,279
really small

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,279
you're going to start to see silos um

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,360
as we look at agile this could be in the

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:12,079
context of squads it could be in the

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,160
context or spotify for tribes or domains

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,000
they're how we scale because again as

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,480
the organization grows you need to be

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,279
able to stratified a little bit

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,279
hopefully a little bit

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,120
and that's good and it's healthy and

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,920
it's kind of needed to make sure

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
that we can still deliver on our

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,240
responsibilities

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,120
but it can also become an impediment to

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,320
to working together and all of a sudden

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,440
you start getting

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,680
different answers to the same problem

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,360
we see this a lot in open source it's

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,639
natural it's organic

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,360
it's not a bad thing by itself but if we

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,199
can combine our efforts

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,160
in the open source environment we've

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,480
seen how that can make a difference

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
um it doesn't mean there needs to be one

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
answer

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,600
but it there also shouldn't be a hundred

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,519
um

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,120
because it becomes a resource think all

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,839
of those different communities need to

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,399
exist

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,120
and they need to have ongoing investment

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,920
so if we can kind of marshal all those

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,839
resources into fewer answers

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,199
hey maybe maybe we can do some cool

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,320
stuff

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,079
um so one kind of practice

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,000
as your as your program office kind of

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,120
evolves that you should be looking into

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
is applying

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,680
open source principles inside your wall

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
um nisia called this out um on the other

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,519
track a little bit earlier

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
uh so the inner source commons that's

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,959
what that logo is it kind of looks like

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,880
zebra kind of looks like it

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,880
it should give you a little bit of a

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,800
headache um

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,320
but what you're doing is you're applying

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
these principles

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
that have been proven in open source on

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,959
collaboration collaboration between

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,639
parties that that don't share uh common

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,000
goals or or common

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,560
visions um but end up

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,440
resulting in some some pretty cool stuff

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,480
coming

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,400
because they build trust and we

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
kind of figure out what what community

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,679
norms look like

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,120
what governance looks like how to

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,439
operate a little bit more neutral

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,400
in these ecosystems can't get rid of

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
your bias

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
we all carry it we can understand what

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,880
that means

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,559
to to build towards consensus

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
understanding that that if we all can

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
come to

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,760
standard answers that okay cool that

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,799
that's something that allows uh

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,640
again jevin's paradox um once you get to

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,880
that common answer

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
you can create unique kind of

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,760
implementations of that

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,679
um you can riff on it and

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
the each organization can be responsible

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,240
for their little

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,320
um perspective but it doesn't take away

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
from the entire thing

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,240
um you're going to be looking at your

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,160
conduct

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,919
as you break down these silos you have

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
businesses that whether they didn't

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,280
compete directly

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,480
they just didn't talk as they're now

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
communicating with each other maybe some

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,240
friction

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,640
and some code of conduct violations

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,960
might show up

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
so the important thing is going to be

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,000
happening there

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,600
it's happening behind your firewall

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,559
build these skills internally

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,280
there's a lot of benefit there because

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,280
as they

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,640
as you kind of move beyond the continuum

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,200
and you you start working

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
externally whether it's in a foundation

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
managed project

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,600
your own projects somebody else's

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,200
project

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,160
you don't want to be responding

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,320
to hey your associate was was acting

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,960
inappropriately in my community

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
can you help that's just it's it's

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
difficult

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:05,600
it's ugly um you want to reduce

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,559
those things as much as possible um

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,160
so helping teams understand what open

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,000
source means

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,679
again behind the behind the firewall

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,360
can make a big difference and it helps

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,160
build that accountability

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
that they feel responsible here they

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,480
understand

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,039
that it's not just about their

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,440
particular goals um it's also about

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,679
uh the community and is about the brand

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,600
itself that they're representing

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,400
uh so fill those skills

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
and mature there

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,200
and then the third c is character

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,440
so when we think about open source we

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,480
think about this kind of external

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
brand whether that is somebody's github

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
user

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,880
uh users face uh when think about the

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,960
organizations they affiliate with

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,120
um it's on display for everybody to see

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
and oftentimes with an organization

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,860
regulated or not

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,080
that's a sensitive topic

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,880
[Music]

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
people can get really really concerned

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,679
about

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,159
what what that means to the brand

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,600
because

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,880
there's a little bit of risk there and

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,280
but it you can't not do it it's not open

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
source

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,400
if there's not the openness so we have

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,919
to learn what it what it means

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,919
how to do it well so again another call

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,200
out to the to-do group

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,480
there's huge opportunity

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,919
not always no no no community is going

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,840
to be perfect

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,240
um but there's plenty of them to learn

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,520
from

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,640
it's a willingness to go in to listen

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,679
um to chop wood and carry water as sarah

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
novotny would see

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,880
would say really try and

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
to learn as an organization i feel like

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,440
i'm learning

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,799
all the time there's

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,480
new things that i'm being exposed to

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,400
i i'm not a career open source person

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,559
i've interacted with open source for a

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
significant part of my career

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,679
but it wasn't something that kind of

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,480
could go paid my bills so i'm constantly

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,600
learning

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,880
both from new organizations those who

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,960
are coming at it with a set of fresh

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,320
eyes and a certain perspective

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,799
because of the business domain that

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,000
they're in to those who are

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,120
incredibly mature who have who authored

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
standards that i would read in school

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,320
and it's amazing to kind of get their

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
perspective

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
around where things have gone uh that

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,480
they couldn't have guessed

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
they wouldn't have imagined um if they

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,799
did they

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,840
they could have been retired to a far

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,640
off island someplace

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,080
um but uh from that that openness

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,159
perspective

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
uh you can get exposed to a lot of stuff

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,159
if you're just willing to learn

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,170
um and as an organization a lot of

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,799
said about open source sustainability um

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,720
[Music]

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
an organization can invest in its

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,679
passions

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,840
what are the projects if we go back to

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,919
that first fee on compliance and

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,360
understanding what your portfolio looks

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,960
like

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
you'll get a better understanding of

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,799
what your developers are using

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,400
how are they using it how many

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,360
developers

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,159
and based around that you can now

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,840
provide

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,240
some guidance around strategic

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,200
contributions

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,240
that may be hey let's be a foundation a

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,159
foundation member

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,640
linux foundation cncf cdf

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,720
whatever whatever is is kind of exciting

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,760
you um and again that's going to be in

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,000
some ways unique to your organization

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,280
in foundation membership is great it's

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,840
part of that sustainability story

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,880
but contribution is something that is

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,919
essential

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,120
it's the core of open source so the more

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,200
that we can do

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,919
is is help give good onboarding

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,280
to our associates around how they can

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,320
invest

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,760
because they're thinking a little bit

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,159
about themselves they're thinking about

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
their github resume

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,679
but honestly they're just excited about

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,880
that work

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,039
and they want to make a difference

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,799
whether it's an enhancement or a bug

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,280
or some documentation fill in the blank

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,080
there needs to be a mechanism to take

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,440
that that

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,279
energy and direct it out

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,480
it's it one associate as an organization

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,360
a much lower cost than

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,320
running a work so releasing a work is

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
expensive

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,799
a lot's been written about it it takes

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,520
dedicated engineers

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,520
it takes dedicated marketing it takes

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,840
sending people to conferences to get

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,880
and build a community all of those

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,480
things cost

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,799
dollars and they are important and they

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,960
should be part of your portfolio

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,960
but it doesn't have to be the only part

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,840
of your portfolio

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:21,120
working upstream in in those same common

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,600
environments it's lower cost

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,000
you may still get there you may become a

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,120
kubernetes sig lead or

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,240
some stratospheric role

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,679
in some major project but in general

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,799
it's going to just be the basics

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,919
handling issues making sure that

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,679
that first contact on a pull request is

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,200
met

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
all of those things really make a

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,919
difference to those communities

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,600
and again the more people that that pile

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,640
into that community

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
um the better off it may be for all of

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,640
us

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,640
so it's those investments in

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,279
standards and common places that people

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,880
feel comfortable and excited about

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,840
um that can really make a difference

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
uh find your consortis find your

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,240
partners

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,440
in some ways that can be a technical

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,640
project

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,640
but it can also be domain level so uh

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,919
john mark called up uh finnos the

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,000
financial services

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,480
organization that or foundation that

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,480
joined linux foundation recently

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,000
there's there are projects that fit

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
under finnos

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,720
but a big part of that is financial

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,279
services organizations getting together

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
talking about our shared problems and

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,440
figuring out hey what the

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
what are potential common answers um it

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
doesn't mean we

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
always agree but at least we'll have

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,799
kind of wrestled with it and be able to

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,720
a little

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,080
do a little retrospective of our own

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,120
approaches

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,919
and ask okay well this organization is

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,320
approaching

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,880
kubernetes multi-tenancy uh this way

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
so may can we can we move that way or

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,840
the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,000
do our needs or our our needs different

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,320
enough

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
that we gotta we have to keep going our

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,159
own direction

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,360
um so you can still get that kind of

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
fork and merge

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,919
type of activity because you're exposed

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,000
to other people

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,279
because you're listening because you're

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,320
you're you're putting

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
things into action

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,480
and be engaged

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,440
supporting a foundation doing a gig

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,679
investing in in kind of cross-cutting

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
programs things like tied list

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,760
they're all important financial parts

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,039
are a major part of open source it's

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,679
just a reality

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
because people have to pay their bills

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,400
um

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
you can't disconnect that that part of

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,159
the motivation

00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,320
um but the investment of

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
our expertise our knowledge our

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,279
developers

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,960
um our experience can

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,960
be incredibly valuable to a project um

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
and again that needs to be weighted as

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,120
part of your kind of

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,120
character how do you help your

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,320
developers work upstream

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
in a safe way in a way that reflects

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
well on the brand

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,440
um because again there is some risk

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159
there

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
uh and and helps again see all these

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,000
communities

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,880
be a little bit more sustainable

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,279
i said there was three c's uh there's

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,039
actually a fourth

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:47,760
so credibility um

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,760
one thing to think about is

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,200
these kind of three c's it's like a

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,640
three-legged stool

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,240
um they don't really operate unless you

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,279
have all three

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
you you may start off um with a

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,320
compliance motivator

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,480
but if that's the only place you you are

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,240
on kind of consuming open source and

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
just basically

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,399
keeping the auditors off your off your

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,039
back you're missing out

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,640
on a huge opportunity for your

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,080
developers to learn from other

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,000
other parties from uh that are both

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,000
inside your organization but also

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,279
outside your organization

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and reducing that kind of

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,600
undifferentiated heavy lifting

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,760
um so but you also can't be just

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,880
externally focused and and not care

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,200
about policy and not care about process

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,480
because that's unrealistic for most

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
employees

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,679
they're going to look at their

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
employment contracts where they're going

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,799
to look

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,840
at a set of policies and controls or

00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,039
e-communications and social media

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
policies

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,640
and they're going to look at that at

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,039
open source and go oh

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,880
it didn't tell me what was safe it

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,399
didn't tell me how to approach this

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,159
problem

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,080
so i'm just not going to do it

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,520
that's not where you want to leave your

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,440
associates

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,360
so you want to be able to invest in all

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,960
three spaces

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,880
and what that will do is over time

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
your associates will get more confident

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,919
and it does take

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,000
time especially if you're a mature

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
organization that's been around for a

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
while

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,880
there's a lot of lessons that have been

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,480
learned there's a lot of

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,960
of culture that's been built and

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,640
having people understand a big paradigm

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,440
shift like open source or open

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,320
collaboration

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
can make a big difference especially

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,760
when

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,520
folks like the sec get bandied around

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,840
again we want to be able to kind of

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,520
neutralize some of those myths

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,440
over time but you want to build that

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,480
essentially that credibility through

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,679
helping associates do cool things

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,039
um you just need to be patient uh

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,919
there's gonna be days that are gonna be

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,880
wins

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,799
uh you release a work or a patch gets

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,799
merged

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,880
or you you jump into some

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,399
tribe meeting or domain meeting or squad

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,039
meeting and

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,960
a team is really excited about

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,080
contributing more significantly

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,679
to another project or strategically

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,840
potentially they were on a commercial

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,440
product and they want to adopt something

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,640
open source because they want to have

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
that ownership

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,360
culture those those are the wins that

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,039
you kind of

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,399
uh cherish um and there's gonna be days

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,000
that that just doesn't happen

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,440
and that's okay um so

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,039
uh be patient especially if if this is a

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
new thing for your organization if your

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,520
organization has been

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,399
around for a while there's a lot of

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,360
lessons there

00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,039
and people take time and they need time

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
to be able to process those changes

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,399
measure yourself so setting up criteria

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,640
setting up goals these don't have to be

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,360
giant earth moving goals

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,399
um set small wins take things day by day

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,679
really look for that that next best step

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,559
um trying to be microsoft

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,760
is not going to happen it's going to be

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,120
a challenge

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,360
but that's the reason microsoft is

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,640
microsoft um

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,360
and your organization is you

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
so find those things that make sense to

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,320
your organization

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,760
uh feed them nurture them

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,640
be their voice be their advocate and in

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,919
all those things

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,720
be that fresh set of eyes to help people

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,760
understand

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,760
hey this is a practice that comcast has

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,279
has adopted or this is a practice that

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,519
microsoft has adopted or capital one

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,320
how can we learn how do we build those

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,159
bridges

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,760
and start those conversations oftentimes

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,760
i feel a little bit like a traffic cop

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,159
helping get people the best answer

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,720
i may have an answer about licensing

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,440
i'm still not as excited as as chris de

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,480
bono from the keynote this morning

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,080
but i have read most of them um i am not

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,519
a lawyer

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,519
but i do have a good feeling of what

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,559
they're what they're saying

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,720
so we will have some answers but

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,320
most of the time the program office's

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,200
responsibility is to

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,120
to build that consensus where is legal

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,960
sit where does security sit

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,799
uh where's our external communications

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,840
set what do they say about

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,559
this effort intellectual property

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,320
patents

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,360
still in the ring blank you you tend to

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,960
be the locusts

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,799
of so many concerns and then you try to

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
lay them out and approach them in the

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,559
most rational way possible

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,480
um that helps the developer feel heard

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,760
because often times when you're

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
confronted with

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,480
10 or 20 different bureaucrats um the

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
answer is just going to be it's just too

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,720
hard

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,600
um and that's not the best answer so

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,960
hopefully over time as you kind of look

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,080
strategically at

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,559
starting a program office

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,600
you you willing to take that first step

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,240
uh find it find a problem find a concern

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,559
um ideally from your developers that

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,840
makes sense to your management

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
um and then resolve it and then go back

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,159
to those same stakeholders and say

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
this makes sense do you find this was

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,159
valuable they say yes

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,880
do more they say no you can ask why

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,880
and there could be a hundred reasons on

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,919
what could be the impediment there

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
that's okay that's open source we're

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,519
constantly making bugs and we're

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,840
constantly resolving them

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,480
so continue to learn and be open to

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,480
those things

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
so summary oh

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
it actually went a little bit quicker

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,560
than i expected um

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,760
but summary um compliance

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,520
community character

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,320
the three c's you can you can find

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,839
a little bit of meaning in each of those

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,359
that makes sense to your

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
specific organization

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,720
there may be ones that are are stronger

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,399
there there are stronger needs

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,760
more immediate needs in your

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,200
organization

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,440
cool that's okay invest there

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,159
make sense just don't don't lose track

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,879
of the others

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,000
because you you'll kind of be stunted

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,040
you'll you'll rock around

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,960
on your three-legged stool

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,320
so you want to be able to invest and

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,320
kind of build this

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,359
this story the narrative that's unique

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,359
to your organization

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,760
and again always remember who you're

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,960
responsible to

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,640
it isn't just your management um

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,800
you really need to be talking to your

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,000
development teams uh you really need to

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,280
be talking to

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,640
a lot of different people be constantly

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,760
asking questions

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,960
on if the things that you're putting in

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,680
place

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:31,280
do they make sense so they bring value

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:35,440
and generally do people

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,520
see that the brand is doing better

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
in this ecosystem because of the work

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,920
that's going on

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,280
it doesn't mean you're doing anything

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,560
wrong there could be priority challenges

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,680
communication challenges there's always

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,160
opportunity to refine those things

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,480
just like we would approach a release do

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,000
a retrospective

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,880
ask those hard questions take some good

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,040
feedback and

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
or hopefully good feedback and probably

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,839
some some bad feedback

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,560
uh and and process it see we can make

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,880
different

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,240
um then figure out what your measurement

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,640
is

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
then do

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,200
again making sure to be constantly

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,839
returning value

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,880
um and then again i think the more that

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,000
you approach this as an

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,440
organic approach something that reflects

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,960
your organization how they're structured

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,720
what they do how they do it

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,520
it's going to be a more sustainable

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,000
thing we look at project sustainability

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,839
and again there's no real difference to

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,079
an ospo

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,040
sustainability it's really going to be

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,560
making sense

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,560
and providing value to people

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
so quote this actually just came up uh i

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
was doing a

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,720
training on git i always need a

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,760
refresher

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,240
um and i think it made sense to me

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,839
especially thinking about an ospo

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,000
because often times

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,200
when when you're putting an osbo in

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
place

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,240
you all of a sudden become a little bit

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,359
of a bottleneck

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,880
um did the ospo say this was good did

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,960
they say it was bad

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,000
um so what we want to be able to do

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
um and and dehawk is uh we're previously

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,040
the

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,000
head of visa but find things that make

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,720
sense

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,800
simple patterns it doesn't necessarily

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,839
mean they're right either

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,119
they can just be where you're at today

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
it could be maturity it could be

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,119
controls it could be a reason that

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,000
you're choosing things

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,720
but you should document that motivation

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,960
and

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,640
then be able to kind of reevaluate that

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,320
motivation

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,400
at an appropriate time to see if it

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,320
still makes sense um

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,720
and the more that you build that trust

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,640
with your with your organization

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,480
with all the little domains and tribes

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,720
that sit and sit within it

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,839
um the more they're gonna be willing to

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,720
talk to you

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,680
and ask you for changes and recommend

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,359
changes

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,960
maybe collaborate on changes

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,000
all of that stuff adds up over time

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,040
to more credibility credibility inside

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,720
your organization

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,040
credibility outside your organization

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,240
which is going to be attractive we talk

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
about talent

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,680
often when it comes down to open source

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,720
and

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,599
empowering developers to do cool things

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,280
from our organizational platforms uh

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,760
complete with a paycheck

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,440
um and that's that just comes out

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
one of the natures of open source is

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,960
it's transparent

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,200
um people can go and look at your github

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,400
and they'll measure you by that or

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,320
they'll go and they'll look at the

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
project that they're excited about and

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,440
see

00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,320
hey i recognize that email address

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,599
or they'll hear about stuff or they'll

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,440
back when we used to be able to meet

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,960
face to face

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,320
they'll ask where you were working they

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,119
were really excited with what you were

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,960
talking about

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,280
or they saw a commit whatever it is

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,040
the more that your associates are

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,839
reflecting well on your brand

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,520
in these ecosystems and investing in

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,920
common answers

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,119
um and they're doing it well with

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,880
respect

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,599
um and a little bit of humility also

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,760
um the more that they may be willing to

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,760
join up

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
so sometimes it can be hard to measure

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,240
those type of

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,800
opportunities but

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,599
if you look at half of the half the

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,880
speakers

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,480
at ato uh i'm sure many of them were at

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,240
different organizations

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,880
a year ago or two years ago um

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,560
because world especially technologies

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,520
we're always driven by the next cool

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,880
thing

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,480
or that next challenge and sometimes we

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,560
need to help that out

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,079
kind of nudge it in a certain direction

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,119
so

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,200
and that's what i got

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,200
