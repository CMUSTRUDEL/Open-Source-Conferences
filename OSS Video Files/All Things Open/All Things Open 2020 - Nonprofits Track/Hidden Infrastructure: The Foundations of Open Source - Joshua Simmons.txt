Title: Hidden Infrastructure: The Foundations of Open Source - Joshua Simmons
Publication date: 2020-12-18
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Nonprofits Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Joshua Simmons, Salesforce + OSI
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Nonprofits Track

Abstract: Modern software development wouldn’t be possible but for the work of countless nonprofits, yet we the benefactors of their work largely labor in blissful ignorance of this hidden infrastructure. I did too, for 15 years.

Linux, Git, Python, Drupal, Homebrew, Eclipse, Apache Web Server, and Kubernetes–these are just a few of the ubiquitous projects that rely on nonprofits. Even open source licensing itself relies on a nonprofit!

In this talk, we’ll survey the nonprofit ecosystem that undergirds our industry. We’ll answer questions, including:

- Who are these nonprofits?
- What do they do?
- Why does it matter?

We’ll explore why the future of open source, and our livelihoods, rests on the continued existence of these nonprofits. And lastly, we’ll answer the question: what is our role, as creators and consumers of open source software, in light of all this?

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,960
initiative the nonprofit that stewards

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
the open source definition

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
in the osi approved license list

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,199
i go by josh my pronouns are he slash

land of the lucatua and coast miwok

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
i have had many different relationships

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,920
with open source

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
over the last 22 years and over the last

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
six years

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
i've had the great honor of working as a

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
community manager in

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,600
one form or another serving the entire

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,320
open source ecosystem and in that time

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
i've developed some thoughts about the

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,719
ecosystem's health

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,760
and the threats that it faces

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,280
we face many challenges today

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,880
i'm here to speak to you primarily about

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
one the pervasive

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
lack of awareness about the open source

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,159
ecosystem

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
most specifically its foundations

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,200
modern software development wouldn't be

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
possible but for the work of countless

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
non-profits

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
yet we the benefactors of their work

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
largely labor and blissful ignorance of

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,840
this hidden infrastructure

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,759
i did for 15 years

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
my career kicked off as a freelance web

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
developer in which i was selling my

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
services producing drupal in wordpress

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
powered websites

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
i used and benefited from free and open

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
source software for about 15 years

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
before i even realized that something

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,040
special was happening

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,439
like many i took it for granted

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
as a consumer and even as a creator

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,600
as open source continues to balloon and

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,439
the burden

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
placed on these non-profit scales

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,679
our collective disregard presents an

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
increasingly

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,560
dire threat to the very things enabling

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,440
the spectacular commons that is

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,440
open source our foundations

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
today i'm sharing this talk as a public

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,120
service

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
announcement we're going to spend as

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,599
much time as possible in the

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,239
conversation in the q a but what happens

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,040
tomorrow is what's most important

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
will you look to the future will you

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,800
approach

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
open source as a garden to be tinted

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,280
will you view financial support of open

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,680
source foundations as charity

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
or as an investment in our collective

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
future and

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,560
your ability to do business will you

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
share what you've learned

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,360
let's dive in with a little context

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,920
a brief history around

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
85 we get the four freedoms in the free

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,280
software foundation

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,640
the original definition that was used to

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,200
uh to analyze licenses the original

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,319
criteria to determine whether software

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,480
wasn't was uh free software

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,640
or gave you the user software freedom

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,799
from the four freedoms we got the debian

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,159
free software guidelines

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,720
the dfsg was then used in 1998

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
to give us the open source definition

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,599
which is the

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
original nine point definition now ten

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,560
point definition

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
that the open source initiative uses to

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,319
determine whether a license is open

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,720
source or not

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
and then whether a project who uses that

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,920
license is themselves

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
open source by merit of that license

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
in the early 2000s we saw a cambrian

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
explosion

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,360
of open source enabled by predictable

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
licensing

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
and largely centered around shared

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,720
hosting

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,480
in the lamp stack linux apache mysql php

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
in order to provide stewardship for

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
these open source technologies

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,440
organizations were spun up like the

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
python software foundation

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,479
the apache software foundation and the

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
drupal association

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
okay so look i started this with a vague

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
building metaphor

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
clearly i've already abandoned that in

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,520
favor of the metaphor

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,479
around ecosystems it is so important

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,759
to view open source in everything in it

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,440
and around it

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,400
as an ecosystem projects

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,320
maintainers contributors or profits and

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
non-profits

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
including trade associations and

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,840
charities hobbyists

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
students professionals entrepreneurs and

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,280
investors

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,000
these are just a few of the stakeholders

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,039
in the open source ecosystem and every

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,560
single one of them

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,680
is both essential and comes to the table

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,160
with its own with their own motivations

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
we're all playing in the same space we

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
all occupy an essential niche

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,800
and we all have different incentives

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
motivations and goals

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,120
like an ecosystem imbalance

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
is a threat when one component is too

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
powerful

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:38,560
or one component is under-resourced

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,639
the whole thing is in jeopardy

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
much has been made of the subject of

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
sustainability

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,960
since 2014 in the wake of the heartbleed

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
vulnerability

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
we've seen a litany of research

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
initiatives

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,840
and events aimed at addressing what we

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
call the sustainability problem

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,919
and while sustainability is absolutely

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,280
an appropriate thing to discuss and

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
explore

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
and of course it fits the ecosystem

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880
model

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
i worry we've spent too much time

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
focusing on projects

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
and not enough time on the organizations

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,960
that make their work possible

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,440
or on the evolving power dynamics

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,120
look just like sustainability is only

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
one part of addressing the climate

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,960
crisis

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
sustainability of open source projects

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
is also

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,639
only one part of addressing the issues

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
we see in open source

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
so about those foundations with a little

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,319
bit of the scenery set

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,600
let's talk about them first let's talk

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
about who they are

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,720
just go over a few examples there are

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,759
lots of different types of foundations

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,440
first standards organizations you have

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,440
oasis in ieee who give us standards for

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
communications protocols and document

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,759
formats and things like that

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
we have the w3c as well working in that

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,319
space

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,720
arguably the open source initiative osi

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
is itself a standards organization

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,599
except it only has one standard and

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,840
that's the open source definition

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,400
standards organizations are one type of

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
foundation

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,080
then we have foundations that are

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
primarily project hosts

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
you look at the apache software

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,479
foundation and the python software

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
foundation

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
python is focused on the python

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,479
programming language and the ecosystem

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
around it

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,080
and apache software foundation is

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,039
focused on delivering open source to the

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
world

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,080
with the apache way

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,960
so we've got standards bodies we've got

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
project hosts

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,400
and then we have a few different

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
permutations on those

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
for instance we have the eclipse

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
foundation and the linux foundation

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,160
which are both trade associations and

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
project hosts

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
i'll unpack what that means a little

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
later

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,199
the last really distinct category of

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,639
foundations that i think really stands

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,759
out to me

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
are the advocacy organizations um

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,280
for instance software freedom

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,599
conservancy which is a combination of

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,240
advocacy on software freedom user

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160
freedom gpl compliance

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
as well as a project host of some of the

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
world's most popular projects

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
git for example

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
so these are just the types of

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
organizations that are out there in the

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,000
foundation space

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
now what do they actually do

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
these organizations engage in advocacy

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,440
work

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
these organizations provide fiscal

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
sponsorship they provide a home

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,719
for these projects when we have an open

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,640
source project

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
when the project is first created the

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,120
copywriting all of the assets for that

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
project

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,399
are assigned to that project's creator

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,839
that creator might be an individual that

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,279
creator might be

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,800
an individual who's working at a company

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
in which case that company has all the

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
rights and assets

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,720
to that project

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,200
that's an okay way to start there's no

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,760
problem with that

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,160
but ultimately for a project to see

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,839
massive adoption

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,399
we need to be able to trust that that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,080
project is in a neutral space

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,680
and is going to behave in a predictable

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
fashion and

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,880
that if there is a place for us all to

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,440
put shared resources for that project

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
so these foundations they do advocacy

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
work

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
but they provide fiscal sponsorship and

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,720
that includes

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,519
a bank account access to an accountant

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,760
access to attorneys you know all of this

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
administrative overhead that frankly

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
few if any open source projects want to

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
take on on their own

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
better to rely on a foundation that is

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
already expert in those things already

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
has those resources

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,839
and share those costs with other open

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
source projects

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
we also have foundations that some also

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,279
provide project infrastructure

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,519
sometimes they even provide project

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,040
governance

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,800
it varies speaking of

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,959
let's talk a little bit more about how

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,519
these different organizations

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,760
vary yes we talked about the different

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,560
types there are the standards bodies the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,480
the trade associations the uh the fiscal

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,760
sponsors the advocacy orgs

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
and realistically you look at any one

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,079
organization

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
it's going to be some combination of

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
those things

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,160
there are a few other dimensions on

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,279
which foundations vary

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,399
that are important for us to be

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,279
cognizant of first of all

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,720
where is that organization incorporated

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
every organization is officially

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,360
incorporated in

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,160
some geographic locale linux australia

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
in australia the open source initiative

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
palo alto here in california

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,000
free software foundation europe europe

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,279
the eclipse foundation

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
is going to be based out of brussels

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,920
pretty soon

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,279
this matters because this tells us both

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,640
about the

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,120
laws and rules that they are subject to

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,760
in the way that they're going to operate

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,480
but this also tells us about

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
the relationships that that foundation

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
can bring to bear

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,880
it goes without saying or it should go

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
without saying that linux australia is

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
going to do a better job

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,800
connecting a project with stakeholders

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,320
in australia than say

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,920
the linux foundation itself would

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,560
so there's this geographic distribution

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
and then there's the corporate dna you

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
know what is the

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,519
entity itself and now i

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
have not done uh i have not been

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,000
involved with running organizations that

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
are not based in the

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
united states so i don't have much of a

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,800
view into what the

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,079
options are in this elsewhere but i will

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
tell you at least a little bit about

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,920
what the

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
what that looks like here in the united

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,880
states

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
because realistically all of us have to

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,600
contend with the united states-based

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,839
foundations in this work

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
so in the united states there are

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,839
broadly two major

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
categories uh that the foundations fall

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,639
into

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
we have the non-profit charities

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,160
sometimes you'll hear them referred to

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
as 501c3s

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
and then we have the trade associations

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
and sometimes you'll hear them referred

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
to as the 501c6s

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
it's the archine reference to the irs

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,920
code into which they are organized

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,120
don't need to remember those numbers

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
these two entities

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,200
serve fundamentally different purposes

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,760
they may both serve as project hosts

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,040
they may both do some advocacy

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,200
but whereas a non-profit charity cannot

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
be a pay-to-play operation where

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,880
non-profit charity

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
cannot engage in things like lobbying

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,120
that's exactly what a trade association

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,800
is for

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
and so you look at organizations like

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,120
software freedom conservancy which is a

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,000
charity it's a non-profit charity

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,880
they cannot be bought and paid for

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
with a trade association those exist

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
specifically

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
to bring trades together in a space that

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
is

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
neutral where they can collaborate and

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
they can

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
work together on advancing their shared

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,720
interests

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
there's nothing wrong with that they're

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,160
again an essential part of the ecosystem

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,120
but they are fundamentally different

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,639
now often people like me will be heard

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
trying to

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
paint these two things and contrast them

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
the the charities versus the trade

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,360
associations

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:47,199
truth be told it's not black and white

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
the eclipse foundation behaves a little

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,959
bit more

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,320
like a non-profit charity than say the

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,760
linux foundation does

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
even though they're incorporated under

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,360
the same rules

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,240
so though this is an important

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
distinction

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
the the charity versus trade association

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
it's most important for knowing sort of

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,959
what the

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
realm of possibilities are for that

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,639
organization it doesn't necessarily tell

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,839
you a lot about what the organization

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
actually does

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,240
so you need to look further to

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,920
understand that

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
these foundations also vary on their

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,720
mission

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,120
the apache software foundation is a

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
clear plain and well i won't call it

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
plain and simple but it is a

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
clear fiscal sponsor for open source

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,440
projects

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,199
and advocating for the apache way

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
that is what it is very very good at

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,639
doing you look at the software freedom

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
conservancy

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,839
yes they're a fiscal sponsor they

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,440
provide a home for projects and they do

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
that very effectively

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,480
i should know i'm a member of one of

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
their projects north bay python

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,839
but software freedom conservancy has a

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,399
mission

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,600
around user freedom and so they only

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,600
accept projects

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,320
that align with that licensing and align

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
with those goals

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,839
so the missions vary you've got

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
conservancy focus on user freedom you've

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,279
got the python software foundation

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
focused on python the drupal association

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
focused on drupal

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
those things vary from one from one to

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
the next another way in which these

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,279
organizations vary

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
is the way that they are governed first

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,959
the organization itself

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,320
some have elected boards some have

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
appointed boards

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
some have boards where you can pay to

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,120
get a board seat

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
some don't there's also the governance

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
of

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,079
at the project level some foundations

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,720
ask have opinions about how the projects

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,920
that they

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
steward should be run for instance with

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
north bay python

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,560
and software freedom conservancy they

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,279
have some specific specific

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
rules and bylaws that we need to abide

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,000
by

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,839
in order to stay in good standing as a

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
as a member project

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
for instance as a member of the project

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,160
committee for the north bay python under

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,519
software freedom conservancy

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,480
there can only be at most you know 20

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,000
of any one company or employer

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
represented in the project management

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
committee

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
and that just ensures that there's some

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,320
neutrality around the way that the

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,639
project is run

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
but not every foundation is so

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,160
opinionated about how a project's run

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,680
some of them take a very light touch and

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,360
they just let the project define that

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,120
for themselves

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,399
and there's room for both of these some

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,639
projects need that

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,680
that extra there's extra opinionated

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
governance some don't

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
the last two ways that i see foundations

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
really

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
varying from one to the next is the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,440
level of support that they get

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
in the funding mechanisms that they have

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,079
access to

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,040
broadly speaking every foundation has

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,040
sponsors

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,880
and most foundations have some form of

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,279
individual membership

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,399
individual the the proportion of those

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,800
things

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,560
varies from one organization to the next

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,360
but by and large it's corporate under

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,400
sponsorship that is underwriting uh the

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,079
majority of their budgets

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,679
however that can take different forms

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,360
if you look at the if you look at the

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,559
python software foundation

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,679
they run pycon us every year as a profit

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,760
generating machine for the nonprofit

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,760
that they can then reinvest in giving

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,839
out hundreds of thousands of grants

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
every year to encourage the growth and

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,440
development of the python ecosystem

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
it's important to recognize how they're

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,320
funded because

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
this sometimes can tell you a little bit

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,600
about

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,080
where they need help or when they are at

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,080
risk so for instance when the pipe when

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,600
pycon us was canceled because of

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,039
the the pandemic that presents

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,559
a very real threat to that organization

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,360
whereas for others the event might not

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,360
be such a big deal

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,679
so we've talked about the types of

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,559
foundations we've talked about what they

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
do

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
we've talked a little bit about how they

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,360
vary

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,360
let me briefly share why they matter

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,880
without foundations there is no body

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,240
to convene disparate stakeholders around

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
shared interests

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,400
there's no vendor-neutral territory

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
there's no one to level that playing

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
field

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,160
open source would be less predictable

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,000
less stable

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,679
and more prone to gaming by

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,720
well-resourced interests

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,720
abstinent foundations

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,880
okay we've talked a little bit about

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
the setting how we got to where we are

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,559
who those foundations are what they do

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,760
why they matter

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,840
i opened this presentation

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
with a note of concern

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,760
i may sound concerned should you be

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,320
concerned

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,320
or am i just an alarmist full of hot air

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,440
let me share some of the concerns that i

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
see

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,320
my first cause for concern

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,799
the linux foundation is very good

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,360
at what they do and they fill a vital

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,120
niche in our ecosystem

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
but it's not exactly a secret that they

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
are the 800-pound gorilla in the

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
foundation space

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,120
the linux foundation has a way of

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,679
sucking all of the air out of the room

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,480
and has a poor record when it comes to

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
supporting

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
in shining a light on the rest of the

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,000
ecosystem

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,840
which is substantial increasingly

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
i view the linux foundation as a risky

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,919
single point of failure

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
and unless they change tac i think their

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,200
approach will not only weaken our

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,840
ecosystem

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,559
but it'll diminish the very things that

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,880
have made

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,880
them successful to everyone's detriment

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
but i'm hopeful though there are

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
wonderful people within linux foundation

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
who recognize this issue

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,679
who i've spoken to personally about it

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
and they've been receptive to that

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,400
feedback

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
let's see what they do with it

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,200
there's another 800 pound gorilla again

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,720
a vital part of the ecosystem for-profit

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
companies

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
look i've spent a lot of time on this

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,520
subject through my talks on open source

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,679
citizenship

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,400
and many many others are carrying that

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
tour so i'll keep this bit short

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,760
many companies have gotten far better

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
about investing in the open source

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,919
ecosystem

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,360
but we have a long way to go i met a

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
director of open source a couple years

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,600
ago

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
who didn't even know what the open

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,840
source definition

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,720
was which to be fair

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
isn't as much an indictment of osi's own

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,400
outreach

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,840
as it is of corporate open source

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,840
but it points to a problem

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,799
we need companies to not only be aware

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,799
of the foundations aware of the space in

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,520
which they're operating in

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
but we need them to view investing in a

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,559
diversity

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,679
of open source projects and foundations

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,960
as a necessary and use that word again

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:31,840
investment and get beyond this notion of

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,840
open source and security

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,400
open source fared well in the last

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,799
economic downturn

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
but it was a fraction of its current

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,440
size

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
and far fewer people and organizations

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,600
relied on it the same way that they do

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,919
now

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,640
the economic downturn the inability to

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,400
hold events like pycon or drupalcon

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
is a huge threat to the financial health

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,520
of the organizations that steward the

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,679
technologies we know and love

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,159
so though budgets are tight at

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,280
for-profits who benefit from open source

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:13,840
the situation is even more dire in the

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,840
nonprofit space that we rely on

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,159
this one this one hits close to home

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,559
given my role at the open source

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
initiative

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,039
some like to say we are in a post

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:34,080
open source world i disagree

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,039
we are here for a reason and that's open

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,520
source

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,360
but that's their prerogative i've

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,880
dedicated plenty of time to this subject

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,280
elsewhere so i won't dwell on it

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,440
here but the too long didn't read tldr

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
is that the open source definition has

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
always been tested

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,919
from 98 all the way to present

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,960
and licensing evolved for many reasons

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,000
the pursuit of profit moral pursuits and

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
changing technology

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,559
this has hit a fever pitch recently

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
activists

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,720
venture capitalists in some corners of

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,919
established industry are fighting

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,919
tooth and nail to redefine open source

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,559
osi and the rest of the foundation

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,640
ecosystem

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
has been on the case but we can't

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,960
survive this alone

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,360
we need everyone to jump in because as

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,720
that

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,240
consensus around the meaning

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,679
of open source deteriorates

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,080
the thing that we've come to know and

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,200
love the thing that we come to rely on

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,200
becomes more tenuous

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
okay we've set the scene

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,039
[Music]

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,159
we've talked about who some of these

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,120
foundations are

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,559
the different types of foundations and

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,360
we've talked about some of the risks

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,360
that they're facing

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,480
what do we do about it what can you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,480
do about these things

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,880
become a member most of these

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,200
organizations have an individual

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
if not also an organizational member

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
program

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
the open source initiative certainly

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
does become a member

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
of these organizations sometimes there's

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,080
a small fee attached with

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,840
attached to it but remember these are

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
non-profits they could probably use that

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,240
funding

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,039
become a member of the foundations whose

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,039
work you rely on

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,880
sponsor the foundations they need it now

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,880
they need it now more than ever

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,679
volunteer many foundations rely on

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,760
some level of volunteer label labor

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,559
including board service

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
so get involved

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,679
and just broadly participate you'll

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,120
respond to their surveys participate in

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,919
their mailing list forums or working

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,919
groups

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
again run for their board of directors

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,000
get a job add a foundation

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,520
we need we desperately need good talent

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,279
in foundations

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
and many people never even consider

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,760
foundations when they're on the job

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
search

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,080
so put that in your back pocket and

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
remember that next time

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:35,520
and then educate because

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,520
the risks that i outlined

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,880
they're not going away and

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,039
in an environment in which we are

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,120
broadly unaware

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,360
of our foundations and just how reliant

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,159
we are on them

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,880
in that environment those risks that i

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,720
outlined

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,640
are far more threatening than they

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,000
otherwise would be

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
if there was broad awareness of

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,360
not just say the open source definition

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
and the fact that it has a definition

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,039
but of the non-profits on whose

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
facts we build our careers and our

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
companies

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,159
then no one's ever gonna know that

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:24,320
there's a problem to be fixed in the

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:27,840
first place

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,039
what happens tomorrow

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,919
now that you have some of this

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,919
information is what's most important

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
will you look to the future and approach

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,919
open source

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,240
as a garden to be tended will you view

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,320
financial support of foundations as

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
charity

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,720
or as an investment in our collective

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,360
future and your ability to do business

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,840
will you share what you've learned i

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
hope so

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,720
thank you and i think now we have a

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,840
little time for

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,840
q and d

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,279
folks uh feel free to use the chat

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:35,840
feature

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:35,840
to drop questions if you have them

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,600
i'm also going to give you your 15

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,600
minute warning

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
thank you

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,039
ah great question here where do you

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,279
recommend

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,799
people look for open source foundation

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,080
jobs

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,880
there are a couple places that i

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
recommend first there's something called

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,520
the

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,440
floss foundation's mailing list um

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,880
this mailing list is is basically a

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,840
who's who of

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,520
foundations and when there are new jobs

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,720
being posted at these foundations

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,919
often they'll be posted there so i

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,840
highly recommend checking out the the

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,440
floss foundation's mailing list

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,960
uh if you can't find that

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,159
my contact information is on the screen

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
feel free to reach out and happy to

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,440
point you that direction

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,559
uh i also recommend

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,039
joining the to do group slack

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,240
um if you're okay using slack they have

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,360
a jobs channel

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,679
where often i'll see jobs uh

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
not just for foundations but also for

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,000
you know corporate open source

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,159
so you get a little bit of both there i

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,440
will put in a plug

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,640
for the open source initiative which

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,279
next year is going to be looking

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,559
for to hire an executive director and a

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,120
communications manager

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,360
and a community manager so if any one of

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,200
those house interests you

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:13,840
stay tuned because there's going to be a

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,840
job for you pretty soon

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,840
oh you folks are going too easy on me oh

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,720
there we go another question

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,440
great i'd like to learn more about the

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
space

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,679
is there a matrix survey directory

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,640
wikipedia page etc that summarizes

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,600
various open source foundations

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,520
oh you had better believe it let's see

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,559
here let me see if i can find

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,000
uh the link on the fly here if not i'll

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:53,039
be happy to share this after the fact

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,440
there has been a non-trivial amount of

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,200
research done in this space so there's

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
definitely resources that i recommend

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
you check out

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
um

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,120
thank you i will pick up that question

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
the q a momentarily and i'm going to

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,440
drop

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,840
a handful of

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,840
links

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,880
i really mean it a handful into the chat

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,200
there

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
this is a great way to get a sense of

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,360
where these other

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,360
who these other foundations are

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,559
okay

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,760
um i'm actually having trouble

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,760
pulling up the q a window

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,720
moderator are you able to see the

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,000
question in the q a

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,279
i can it says with the creation of open

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,720
source support groups

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,159
eg ospos in academia and governments

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,840
how can those groups help these

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,399
foundation issues

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,159
um thank you

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,760
i honestly

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,760
the first step is just working on

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,120
awareness you know i think it's

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
important that any time we're talking

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,440
about open source that we make sure

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,880
that uh foundations are a part of that

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,679
discussion

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,440
uh you know i i actually really some

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,960
people get a little uh

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
some people think the apache software

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,360
foundation is a little crunchy

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,120
for uh for mandating that people refer

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,799
to every project with apache

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,480
first you know it's the apache web

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
server it's apache hadoop it's not just

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,279
hadoop

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
but honestly i think that's a very smart

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,120
move on apache's part because that means

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,200
there's a greater awareness

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,480
that there's just this body behind these

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
projects

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,919
and i think we need to start doing that

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,360
for all of these projects

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,039
no i'm not saying we need to enforce the

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,559
same branding guidelines but we just

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,919
need to make sure that the foundations

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,919
are an explicit part of the

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,320
conversations that we're having

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,600
because if we're not continually drawing

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,960
attention to them

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,519
there's just no way that we're going to

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
be able to to have useful conversations

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:15,279
about the

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:18,240
problems that they're facing

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,159
ah another great question here an

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,559
observation i made is that we see the

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
same

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,120
group of people speaking at conferences

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,200
and representing open source software

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
many of them have involved been involved

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
for many years

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
how can we ensure to bring in new blood

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,600
to the ecosystem

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,279
to focus on these high-level issues that

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,559
you mentioned

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,320
i i'm so glad you asked this because

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,480
one of the things that i'm working on uh

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,480
in my my day job is a program called the

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,720
accidental maintainer program

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,720
and we're working on providing sort of

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,720
next level guidance on issues that

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
people who stumble into the role of

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
maintainer

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,799
may not have experience with you know

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,720
community management governance

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,880
succession planning

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,880
because so often open source projects

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,919
don't invest in that succession planning

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,480
and they need to

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,480
the problem that we see in open source

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,399
projects around that

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,039
it's worse than foundations it's

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,480
absolutely worse than foundations

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,159
you know i got into this as a web

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,880
developer

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,120
and it was so easy for me for years for

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,279
two decades to do my job

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
and not even really know what open

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,480
source was

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,799
or that there were you know non-profits

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,159
supporting it

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,279
and not knowing those things

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,640
means that there wasn't even an

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,720
opportunity for me to get involved

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,240
because i just didn't know

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,159
that it was there and so

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,080
the same way that we've seen mentorship

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,480
programs spin up around open source

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,399
projects to bring in new contributors

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,600
the same way we see open source projects

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,240
thinking about building

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
new contributors guides clarifying their

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,320
governance

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,200
and highlighting bright paths

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,640
uh eliminating the way for people to get

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,399
involved with the projects

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,879
we need to do the exact same thing for

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,320
foundations

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,639
i would love to see a foundation

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,159
mentorship program

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,119
probably not going to happen but i think

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,480
that would be extremely valuable

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,359
i would love to see contribution guides

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,359
for foundations

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,280
i think we need to

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,720
raise awareness we need to demystify

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,919
these foundations

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,040
and then we need to impart upon

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,800
we need to impress upon people

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,119
the critical role that these foundations

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
serve

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,000
and how important it is that they get

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,760
involved with those foundations

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,520
look i'm gonna i'm gonna speak selfishly

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,520
for a moment

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,520
you know i was first elected to the open

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,880
source initiative board of directors

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,000
in 2016. i had only been

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,240
consciously aware of open source at that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,839
point for four years just for four years

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,040
and so i got involved with the open

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,160
source initiative i ran for the board of

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
directors i got onto the board of

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,359
directors and i've been on the board for

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,359
four years i'm in my fifth year now

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,720
and it has been great for my career it's

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,680
been great for my profile

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,599
i'm very grateful for it but the

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,040
challenge is that i am largely an

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,560
anomaly

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,400
you know i got into this because i

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,079
served in a meta community manager kind

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
of role

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,880
in a role in which i could see the

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,119
superstructures

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,880
that power open source that was made

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,760
easy and obvious to me

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
through that work if i had stayed as a

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,680
web

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,119
developer i may have continued laboring

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,160
without knowing these things for much

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,760
longer

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
so you know i don't have all the answers

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,920
but we desperately

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,599
desperately need to work on outreach on

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,520
on awareness

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,640
um and mentorship and succession

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,960
planning because you're absolutely right

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,400
we see the usual suspects all the time

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,359
you know even even with osi

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,079
you know we've had people who served up

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,760
the board for

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,000
a decade or more and well i'm grateful

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
for their service

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,440
arguably that might be a sign that we're

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
not we don't have enough churn we don't

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
have enough new blood entering this

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,720
space

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,599
so again i don't have all the answers

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,359
but but i i i strongly believe that

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,280
awareness is the first step

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,839
and then mentorship is the next thing

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,839
that we really need to get into

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,680
we have another question here stumble

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,520
is a good term that you used and you

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,200
mentioned educate

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,520
so what are some good means to provide

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
some guides and maybe even mentors or

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,400
mentorship

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,800
to help guide the next generation into

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,839
the ecosystem

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,960
i'm so pleased to hear this question

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,200
one of the things that uh

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,400
one of the things that we need to do is

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,880
we need to make sure

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,040
that information about open source and

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,400
the way the ecosystem works

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,400
is in curriculum

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,800
we need to make sure that it's part of

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,119
the code bootcamps we need to make sure

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,880
that it's a part of getting that cs

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,240
degree or whatever it may be

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,440
excuse me we need to make sure that

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,599
when people are being taught how to code

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,119
how to build software but they're also

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,440
being taught

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,960
what that ecosystem looks like and why

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,800
it's possible to do what they're doing

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,880
because if we're not treating that

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,960
information as as sort of a

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,320
first order concern in their education

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
they're going to get into industry and

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,240
they're just going to be clueless

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,960
and sure maybe they're productive and

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,320
they can get their job done

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:03,359
but if they are not aware of these

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,880
bigger issues then they're going to

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,839
perpetuate this status quo

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,119
in which we're not adequately aware of

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,240
foundations we're not adequately

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,240
supportive of foundations

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,480
so education is one piece of this and i

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
think getting into getting curriculum

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,119
into boot camps and into

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
universities and other schools is a

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,960
great

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
first step the open source initiative

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,079
has partnered with

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,680
brandeis university and the linux

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,920
foundation has partnership with

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,800
some educational institution and they're

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
providing

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,119
micro courses and certifications and

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,119
other ways to share this information

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,119
so i think that's all very promising

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,079
and i don't know where else we need to

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,119
go but broadly speaking

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,800
we need to meet people where they're at

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,920
because for too long we have relied on

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,920
people discovering us

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,680
and

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,560
that doesn't scale it's not working um

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,960
so i you know we we've this is an area

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,400
where we need to do a lot of

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
we need to do a lot of work to figure

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,839
out where where we need to go to

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,839
to meet these people

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,000
another comment here the drupal

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,720
association's licensing working group

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,520
is now just three 45 plus year old white

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,320
guys

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,000
who all work at universities i would

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,480
love any ideas on how we can attract

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,240
younger more diverse members

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,960
most people i talk to see licensing as a

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,960
solved problem

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:47,280
oh yes this is this is totally a thing

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:51,440
this industry looks way too much like me

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,359
white guys and

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,280
we know that tech industry has a

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,000
diversity and representation problem

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,040
and honestly the problem is ten times

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,240
worse in open source

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:08,319
partially because open source

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:12,160
often requires free time in volunteerism

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,000
which is a filter a proxy for privilege

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,160
you know if i'm if i'm raising children

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,800
or if i'm taking care of my aging

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,520
parents

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,960
or i'm working two jobs i am never going

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,480
to have the time to volunteer

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,000
to voluntarily contribute to open source

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,839
and so we see open source as even less

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,119
diverse in the tech industry itself

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,119
which of course we know is bad

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,520
what we need to do people who look like

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,280
me

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,040
need to take responsibility for creating

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,440
space

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,040
for people not like us we need to make

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,920
sure that we are investing

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,040
in up-and-coming leaders who aren't like

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,960
us

00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,079
because let me tell you the next me

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,640
is gonna do just fine just

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,319
by merit of unconscious bias the next

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,960
white guy who comes along

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,480
they're gonna be fine like yeah they're

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,160
gonna struggle and we should we should

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,079
help them along as well

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,560
but the barriers they're gonna encounter

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,079
in getting involved in this space

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,680
just don't even hold up a candle to the

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,880
barriers faced by literally

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:26,000
anybody else and so we need to

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,040
make space we need to amplify

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,880
underrepresented voices increasingly

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,920
that's what i do with my social media

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,440
i try to broad i try to say less now and

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,200
instead focus on amplifying

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,359
other people whose profiles we need to

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,560
elevate who are the next generation of

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,520
leaders

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,880
we need to make space we need to amplify

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
we also need to make sure that we're

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
building

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,520
welcoming communities in which they know

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,640
that they're going to be welcomed

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,079
yes we need a code of conduct yes just

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
letting you know you have three minutes

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,160
left

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,280
i was waiting to give you your five

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,079
minute warning but you know

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,520
yeah time to get an edward in with me

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,000
thank you for that

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,440
uh yes we need codes of conduct but then

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,160
we also need to know

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,040
that the foundations have an enforcement

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,599
mechanism

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,560
to bear these out now there are lots of

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
things that we can do to bring in

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,839
underrepresented people

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,079
um and i'll also i'll give a shout out

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,640
to the outreachy pro mentorship program

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,560
right now

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,680
which though it's focused on open source

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,880
projects

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,319
i don't think there's any reason why an

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,599
open source foundation couldn't treat

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,240
itself as a project

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,359
and specifically work through mentorship

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,400
programs like that

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,640
that target women non-binary people

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,480
trans folks and other underrepresented

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,400
groups in tech

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,560
so all this is to say is that my

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,040
outreach when i work on a conference or

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,119
or doing any form of outreach i do

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,240
the baseline outreach for the usual

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,000
suspects

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,599
for where you're going to find a lot of

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,280
people who look like me and then i spend

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,359
the majority of my outreach effort

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,040
on the underrepresented groups because

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,079
they're the ones who need to know that

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,599
they're going to be valued

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,720
and welcomed and they're the ones who

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,359
probably won't find you on their own

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,240
so i would just say you know 75 of our

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,359
outreach efforts

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,359
need to be focused on those

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,480
underrepresented people um and there are

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,560
a lot of things that we can do to make

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,200
sure that they know that they're welcome

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,440
and that when they are joining the

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,640
project that we provide them the support

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,640
to rise throughout the ranks and the

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,400
the moral support to keep them around

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,079
because as i say it's not just a

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,240
pipeline problem we have a retention

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,480
problem

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,000
so i have i think one minute left i'm

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,480
going to briefly go through this

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,400
we have from sean says there's been a

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,160
surge of newly approved osi licenses in

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,000
the past couple years with explicit

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,440
adaptations for patent law

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
this trend may extrapolate to

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,599
customizations for trademark law

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,040
and government regulation is expansive

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,800
new licensing a good thing for open

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,560
source software to be embraced as new

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,079
markets embrace the osd

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,359
or an undertone that needs to be

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
addressed by the open source software

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,760
community

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,319
oh this is too big for one minute but i

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,640
will say

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,520
yes it is both concerning and

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,960
encouraging

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,200
and an inevitable result of our success

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,440
we need to be vigilant we need to be

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,599
watchful for

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,000
how we push the boundaries of open

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
source open source definition

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,640
is never above scrutiny it should

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,960
constantly be clarified and annotated

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,480
and refined

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,480
but there are some things about it that

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,160
are sacred and we need to make sure that

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,359
as we experiment and evolve

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,520
that we we mined those things

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,760
so that the very essential ingredients

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,040
that enable our commons

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,960
are not undermined so uh

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,280
it's a it's an inevitable product of our

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,839
success and i would say that vigilance

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,839
is very much to be called for

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,599
and with that i think i'm out of time

00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,200
thank you so much for everyone uh for

00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,760
for being here i really appreciate your

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,319
time and

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,839
and the excellent q a and thank you

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,839
