	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,880
hi there everyone

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,480
my name is jim daguelski i want to thank

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,840
you for attending

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,279
the session today about my historical

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,800
perspective over the asf a little bit of

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,600
the history of the asf

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
how it came to be what we exist for and

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
things of that nature

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
and i figured like gandalf who was also

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,760
a grey beard

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,439
i think using my lord of the rings pipe

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
is most probably a good

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
uh good addition to use as we go through

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
these uh

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,760
the these uh tales of the past

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
uh a little bit about uh myself

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
um i guess the biggest takeaway from

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
this is that i am

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
actually one of the co-founders of the

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
asf been there basically from the

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
beginning

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,680
so there is some uh some good

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
information uh that

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
i can provide to everyone uh and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
secondly

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,120
um i'm lucky enough to to work for uber

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
so if you're looking for a

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
job i really encourage you to look at

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,280
the careers page with uber

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
i'll leave the open source program

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
office there

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
i want to give everyone before we

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,920
actually jump into

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
the history of the asf talk a little bit

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,159
about what the asf

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
is uh it stands for the apache software

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,600
foundation

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
and before that we were just a loose

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
group of

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,680
volunteers called the apache group we

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
were actually incorporated in 1999.

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
we are a non-profit organization there's

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,600
actually

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,720
a specific tax criteria called a 501c3

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
which does need mean a public charity we

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
exist

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
for our memberships and for the public

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,640
itself so we're not like a

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
a trade group example or anything like

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
that we are a virtual worldwide

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
organization

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,680
um we do have an organizational

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,200
structure because obviously we need

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
a formal legal entity to support the

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,920
pure

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
open source and volunteer aspects that

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
we're running on

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,439
and this is the legal structure of it we

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
are run by a board and we'll actually

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,000
talk a little bit about the board as we

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
go through

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
the history of it but the main takeaway

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
again is that the board

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
does not or should not interact or

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,760
influence the direction

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,000
of the projects the projects run

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
themselves the board doesn't say oh you

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
need to add this person

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
you need to add this functionality that

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
is really

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
the project's desire the board of the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
foundation exists

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,840
as servants to the projects rather

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,319
than the reverse the asf's mission is

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
basically to provide software free to

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,959
the uh

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,360
to the public free of charge under a

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,680
very permissive license the license we

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
use the apache license

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
and it provides the opportunity and the

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
legal protection

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
for volunteers to do this kind of stuff

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,159
now as with most

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
organizations we've got this very

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
verbose vision statement

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
but really it's really about

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
community-created code sometimes you

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
actually see

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,519
it referred to as community over code

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
the idea being that you focus on the

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,920
community

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,640
and if the community itself is viable

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,239
and healthy then the software project

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
and the code that results from that

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
software project

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,200
will be just as healthy and viable as

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,599
well

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,480
and we'll talk about why that's the case

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,080
in just a little bit

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,239
another thing to take away is that the

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
asf never pays for the development of

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
projects as i said before

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
it's really about the volunteers the

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
contributors all volunteers all

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,560
contributors

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,159
uh have merit so it doesn't just about

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,680
hey you can be a asf

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
contributor or member if you donate code

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,159
for example

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
you can do anything as long as you

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,840
contribute you are worthwhile

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,920
in the eyes of the asf

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
so let's give a jump right into the

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
history

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,920
now back in 1995 or so there's this

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,400
thing called the world wide web

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
that was just becoming popular a lot of

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,159
people were using it

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
there was of course the old cern web

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
server that

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,199
uh tim berners-lee created but

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
really the the web server that took a

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
lot of people by storm

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,400
was one created by uh ncsa uh

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,520
and the main person behind that was rob

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
mccoll

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
now what happened is that when the

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,280
people behind

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
ncsa you know the people who were making

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,120
the browser

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,000
and rob who was doing the server uh left

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
to create

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,360
netscape you know mozilla basically

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,680
this meant that this web server was

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
stagnant there was no one developing it

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
and we were lucky enough and fortunate

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
enough to basically pull ourselves up by

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
our bootstraps

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,080
and create a fork of the ncsa web server

00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,000
which we called the apache web server

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,720
in honor of the uh the the first nation

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,800
uh colloquially known as the the apache

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
tribe the apache nation

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
because we i like the way that they

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039
governed

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,680
themselves and the idea behind that and

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,160
so for several years

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,240
the apache group was just focused on the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
web server itself that's all we were

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
concerned about all we were

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
concerned about and it very very quickly

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
became the top

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
web server in use throughout the entire

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
web

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
now as it became more useful as it

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
became more

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
popular there were two things that were

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,039
going on

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,639
first of all there was the real desire

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,560
of other entities to to use this open

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
source project and yet it was under an

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
open source license

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,440
but there was no legal entity called the

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,840
apache group

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
and ibm in specific wanted to use the

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
apache web server

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,199
inside their websphere uh web offering

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
inside there

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,800
and they were kind of hesitant about

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
using something that was open source

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
under an open source license even there

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
wasn't really something called

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,360
open source back then but the ideas were

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,840
the exact same

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
what they really wanted to do was say

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
hey enos is under open source but

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,400
there's actually this illegal entity

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
which is releasing it under open source

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
uh that was one thing is that we

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,319
realized that we needed a legal entity

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,759
to make it easier for people to use the

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,520
software because that's

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,280
that's what we wanted to do we wanted

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
people to use the software

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
with as few restrictions as possible and

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
that's the reason why the apache license

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
is permissive

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
the other thing is that we liked things

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,960
such as having

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,240
a roof over our heads and we realized

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,520
that as apache web server got more

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,240
famous more useful um it kind of like

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,000
put us in a precarious position that

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,440
people could sue us even though it was

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
released under something that said hey

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,639
you had

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,560
no warranties to it and you know we

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,440
can't make any guarantees associated

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
with it

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
um we also realize that the world being

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,160
the world and some people being the kind

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,319
of people they are

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
they like going after people and suing

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
them for things if things didn't work

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,479
out

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
so we wanted the legal protection for us

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,800
to continue doing the fun stuff we were

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
doing

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
and we also needed a legal entity to

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
create

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
and release this software and that was

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
the impetus

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,400
behind the apache software

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,599
foundation we wanted to formalize this

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,120
but in a way that was as light weight

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,039
as possible as i said before the asf

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,199
exists basically because we want people

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,360
including ourselves to continue doing

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,840
the fun stuff of hacking your own code

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
and releasing it but we wanted the kind

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
of

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
legal protection and the legal entity

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
that also allowed

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,440
other people to do that so right before

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,280
we incorporated in 1999

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
there's an example of what the website

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,280
looked like and it really was just the

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,599
apache web server project if you went to

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,240
www.apache.org

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
it was the apache group and it wasn't

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
until

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,680
uh you know about june of 1999

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,759
that uh the existing apache group

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,360
members got together

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
created the legal entity called the

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,479
apache softwrap foundation

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
formulated the bylaws associated with it

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,280
created a corporation

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,560
under delaware and apply for 501 c

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,039
3 status and right there you see a copy

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,360
of the incorporation agreement that

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,479
actually bootstrapped and kick-started

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,320
the apache software foundation in 1999.

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,000
now unfortunately the icon for some

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
reason doesn't show up in there

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,720
but you'll see the website is very very

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,000
small and we started off with basically

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,640
two projects uh the first obviously

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
was the web server that's basically the

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
only software project we had

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,440
at that time but also we had the idea of

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,000
conferences now back in 1999 there was

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,519
an apache con conference but it really

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,560
wasn't put on

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,600
by the apache group it was actually a

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,680
um a conference put on by a company

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,560
associated with the asf

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,000
and there was well with apache group and

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,839
a number of us were

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,560
involved in presenting that and things

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,920
like that but we realized that what we

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,720
wanted to do

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,640
is the asf or what would become the asf

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,519
we wanted them to be the controllers the

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
apache com

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,760
so we started off with two projects the

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
web server and conferences

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,800
and we quickly added other things

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
because

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,080
at the time open source was becoming

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,120
much more popular

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
we had a great reputation in the web and

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,640
the internet

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,560
in the it industry as far as being able

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,399
to manage large projects

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,880
and so as java became much more popular

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,519
and especially there was this desire to

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
push

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,040
the uh the java servlet technology

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
sun and and other companies but mostly

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
sun came to us

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,240
and said we would like to donate a lot

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,000
of code to the asf

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
and we'll call it the jakarta project

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
and this will be a place where we could

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
focus

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,399
on java code and especially the server

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,480
technology

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
and also xml was becoming much more

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,519
fashionable

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,320
as a way of um you know passing data and

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
information

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
uh back and forth and ibm came to us and

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
said hey you know we've got all these

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
great projects we like to release these

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,640
as

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
as open source as well so you will see

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,240
as very very quickly

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,600
um the asf in addition to

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,839
uh basically being leaders in the web

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,519
idea with the web server we're also

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,480
considered uh stewards of other

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
technology

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,440
java and xml which were critical in the

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
acceptance of the internet but also the

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
web as well

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
we started off with just basically 21

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
people

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
and one of the first things that we did

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,440
was created

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,480
uh a second version of alv-1

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
uh alv want one

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
which was basically a very very similar

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,240
to the bsd

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
uh license as well very permissive

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
license inside there

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,959
really really no difference behind it

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,079
but you can see that

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,600
at this point in time the reputation of

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
apache and the apache software

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
foundation

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,680
was really starting to grow it was in

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
and 2001 that we actually had our first

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
official

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
apache con that the asf produced and

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
managed

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,160
that was down in florida we added uh

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
apache tickle

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,800
um which and in addition to a number of

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,519
other projects and you'll notice that

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,519
some of those

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,000
projects were actually language based i

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,519
mean java of course was language based

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,920
but there was a growing interest in

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
um not only the fico language but how

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,040
can we incorporate that with the web

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,959
server the same with pearl

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
uh and there was actually a period of

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,680
time when

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,440
php the php group was considered

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,880
a sort of kind of apache project

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
but more like a sister project and for a

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
period of time

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,200
if you went to the website in fact you

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
can see it right here

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
that when you looked at projects under

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,720
the asf php was there

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
even though it wasn't really officially

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
under

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,880
the asf corporate umbrella so

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
and we'll talk about that a little bit

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
because that's a very very

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
interesting story uh we started some

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
initial work

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
on the the second version of the apache

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
license back then

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
uh and as i mentioned before in the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
previous year jakarta

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
grew up you know and jakarta was really

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
specified

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
to be sort of like the repository for

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
all things

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,560
java in fact everything that was under

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
java inside the asf got moved into there

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,880
and what happened at this particular

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,120
period of time is that as the jakarta

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,320
project started to grow

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,519
the number of projects under there also

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
started to increase

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,880
the number of people inside there

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
started to increase

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
but we didn't realize at the time was

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
that there was this growing disconnect

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,920
between what i'll call the traditional

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,399
apache community

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
and the jakarta community and so in some

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,959
ways even though

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,480
it's under the asf it kind of starts

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,519
deviating a little bit

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,560
and starts becoming its own sort of

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,480
entity such that in 2002

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,399
the problem came to a head it was really

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,680
insurmountable and what was the problem

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,320
per se

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,560
the problem was basically that the

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,800
projects under jakarta

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,800
and the contributors and the members of

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
the jakarta projects

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
really did not know anything at all

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
about apache

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,480
did not know uh any ideas or tenants

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
about the apache way

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
which is basically how you grow

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480
communities how you

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
manage the open source projects under

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
there

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
in fact it was almost in many ways its

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,800
own

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,279
independent foundation within the asf

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,079
and what we realized at that time was

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,480
that

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
even though up to that point we've been

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,959
able to assume

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,440
that people could absorb the ideals

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,720
and the tenants of the apache way dress

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
through osmosis

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,760
that that tribal knowledge would be

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,519
shared

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,880
simply because we were all working on

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
the same projects

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,320
well jakarta was kind of like on its own

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
different world

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
and that tribal knowledge was not

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
getting transformed over there

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,920
so the two things that happened because

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,000
of that was because first of all we

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,279
realized that we needed some

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,760
place some method of ensuring

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,600
that new projects that came on board

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
understood what apache was about and

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
understood what the apache way was about

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,720
and that's what the incubator did the

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
incubator is basically

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,920
and still is to this day the place

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,360
where projects learn come to learn about

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,440
the asf

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
and about the apache way and the other

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
thing that we did

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
is that we really encouraged jakarta to

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,440
become much more involved

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,600
in apache making sure that these

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,399
projects and these sub-projects under

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,880
jakarta

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
actually became apache projects and

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,279
really focused

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,399
on ensuring that jakarta moved under the

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,199
asf

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,000
rather than under its own entity so in

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,120
addition to

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,160
the jakarta sub-projects becoming uh asf

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
projects

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
other external projects came in as well

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,360
and the other big thing that happened in

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
which is an adventure that we'll talk

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
about in a bit

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
is that uh apache joined the java

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,759
community

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,519
uh uh process uh and um

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:55,120
that was really the thing that gave

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,240
java and the java community uh

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,560
a sort of important

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
sense of support uh it wasn't until the

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,600
asf joined it

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,639
that i think that java had the kind

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,639
of um you know worldwide or the

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,000
potential for the kind of worldwide

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,600
change agent that it became it was

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,120
really a feather in the java community's

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,120
hat to have apache join and it was

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
really apache saying yeah we believe in

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,320
this technology

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
we believe in the community process

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,639
designed

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,360
to control and manage this process

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,199
um we trust it and we think the rest of

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
the world can trust it as well

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,600
and we'll see in a little bit what

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,959
happens with that

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
excuse me while i take a sip

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
now the next year we started working on

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,560
as i said we were also working on apache

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,759
license 2.0

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,079
but there were certain aspects of 2.0

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,079
that a lot of the projects went in now

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
well in 2002

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,839
and so we said well what we'll do is

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,279
maybe just take some bits and pieces of

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,120
apache 2o

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,360
fold forwarded into apache 1-1 we'll

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,520
call that apache 1.2

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,039
and that never really happened we never

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,839
really got too successful

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
with that um so it was basically dead

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,959
when arrival

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
and the whole idea about what was going

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
on with apache was

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,720
with a php was also coming to a head

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
it's like

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,760
it was kind of weird that we were like

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
being so

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,000
strict with jakarta but php

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
was even in a much more different shape

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,679
than

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,480
than the asf than um jakarta was

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,039
a php was never under apache

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,039
infrastructure although jakarta was

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,880
um you know they weren't under the

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,039
apache license

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
and so it was weird that you know we

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,280
were so forceful on what to do with

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,200
jakarta

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
and we had php was sort of like the

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,160
elephant in the room it's like what

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,039
we're gonna do with this

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,039
another thing that we saw was that uh

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,559
various projects such as

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,360
xml and web services um started becoming

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,520
what we called

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,280
umbrella pmc's kind of similar to what

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,320
was going on with jakarta

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,360
where there was this large top level

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,880
project

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,000
and a whole bunch of smaller subprojects

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
inside

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,919
which really should have been and could

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
have been independent projects

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
themselves and that was something was

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,320
starting

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
starting to grow and we were aware of it

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,160
at the time

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,760
really were concerned uh you know until

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
things started you know popping up later

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,280
on

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,559
in 2004 uh we actually did come up with

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,120
the alv2

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,880
and the main desire well one of the main

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,080
desires of alv2

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,440
was to be compliant and compatible

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,559
with uh the uh the gnu you know public

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,799
library gpl um v2

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,559
um and now during the discussion process

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
and the drafting of it we were assured

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,840
that it was compliant

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,760
that it was compatible with it and it

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,640
wasn't until we released it that

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,840
people said oh no sorry it's really not

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
compatible with the

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,080
v2 sorry about that um so if you go

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,679
to the asf we think it is compatible if

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,400
you go to the free software foundation

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,960
they say it's not compatible

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,799
just take that for what it's worth um

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,559
also during this time

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,480
um we wanted to ensure that all the ip

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
provenance of every piece of code that

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,000
was under the asf infrastructure

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
we had the ability to actually use it in

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,080
re-licensing it

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,320
and so we required everyone who had

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
commit bits under cvs we were still

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,600
using

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
cvs as a version control system at the

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
time

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,600
had signed a contributor license

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
agreement

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,679
you know basically making sure that at

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,799
that point in time

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
every bit every byte of code that was

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,200
contributed

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,960
we had direct ip providence for and so

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,960
that was what i call the the great

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,520
signing we reached out to everyone

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
who had ever made a a commit um that had

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
them signed this form that we tucked

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,280
away someplace

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,039
so we could show clear i.p prominence we

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,080
also created the individual uh

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,240
cla and the corporate cla um also

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
to catch that base later on downstream

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,799
and what's really cool is that the icla

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
is sort of like the standard that's used

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,080
throughout the internet nowadays

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,480
in addition to the dco apaches icl

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
la where the apache cla some people

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
don't use the i

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,039
it's like the default method used to

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,720
ensure that there's ip

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,640
providence um also in 2004 we had what i

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
call the second big painful lesson

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,120
the first one being jakarta and that was

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,280
a project called avalon

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,720
now i included the link inside here

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
because the discussion

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,799
and the history behind it is really

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,159
something that i could spend

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,919
hours over um and the slides are going

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
to be available on slideshare so give it

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,720
a point click and find those through and

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
stuff like that

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,880
the main takeaway for avalon was

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,440
that it really showed that

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
even though apache projects are supposed

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
to be

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,480
very flat everybody's vote is the same

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,120
no benevolent dictator for life it shows

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,159
you the problem that could happen

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,600
when people inside of a project

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,000
or an entity have a personal agenda

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,080
and are able to push that personal

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,440
agenda through

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,840
either because uh the pmc or the project

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
or the entity

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,640
um don't want to be bothered with it or

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
are willing to be steamrollered or or

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,039
whatever

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,440
and what happened with avalon is that we

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,760
realize that the project itself

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
was incredibly dysfunctional that it

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,240
really wasn't

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,480
operating as a community in such a way

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
that it was harming itself apache's

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
reputation

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,039
but also the projects and the entities

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,080
which were other

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,360
under avalon so we disbanded avalon

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,880
we created um top-level projects to

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,960
uh replace avalon

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,919
um and it really showed us that

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,679
it was important again to focus on the

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,760
health of a community

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,159
and make sure that compromise and

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,880
collaboration

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,320
and consensus building were really top

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
priorities

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
um and that was a painful lesson that we

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,159
learned from from avalon

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
um and also at this point in time we

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
really decided that

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,840
a and you know amicable divorce

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,840
uh with uh with php uh made sense uh and

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
so we basically basically said hey you

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
know

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,720
php was never really an asf project

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
and we're just making that official and

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,559
so we moved the other way and another

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,760
thing that happened in 2004 is that we

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,880
were actually

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,320
um jboss came after us just before um

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,559
i think it was before they were bought

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,840
by red hat but they said that geronimo

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,840
project which was

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,400
operating in a very similar technology

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,520
area infringed on some of their copy uh

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
copyrights and what was interesting is

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
that

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,000
when you actually did the investigation

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,559
it was jboss

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,440
who had infringed on some geronimo

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,120
copyrights

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
and some copyrights of other software

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,679
projects inside of there so they kind of

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,840
got it got the

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
bit uh a little bit by that but that was

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,640
kind of interesting

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,640
um in 2005 the whole idea that umbrella

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
project started losing favor

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,880
uh what we did not want to do is

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,200
recreate jakarta fiasco

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,120
with some of the other uh projects

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,320
top-level projects xml

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,559
and stuff like that and so we really

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,520
encourage them to stop having sub

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,840
projects

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,600
and instead have these sub projects

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,000
become top level projects

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,039
and i think one of the first ones to

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
actually

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,559
uh you know leave these umbrella

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,000
projects

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,919
in jakarta was lucine um tomcat also

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
became a top-level project at that point

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,320
it was under the jakarta

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
umbrella at that period of time um and

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,080
we decided to take

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,200
um legal affairs even more seriously

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,919
than we already had

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,520
by creating a vice president associated

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,279
with that

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,320
in 2006 um was the great jakarta

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,200
migration where

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,000
a lot and i mean a lot of sub-projects

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
moved up to

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
the top level status we rebooted a

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
couple

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,480
of um you know projects and committees

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
uh the security team the public

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,720
relations committee were also

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,400
updated at this period of time you know

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
apache was the apache software

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,520
foundation

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
was incredibly popular incredibly

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,840
influential

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,320
um incredibly relevant um and so

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,559
uh the idea of controlling that brand of

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,720
doing external marketing by promoting

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,400
our projects promoting the apache way

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,400
promoting apache cons which is still

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,520
running on uh that was what the

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
prc was designed to do uh we also

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
created

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,159
a couple other projects we actually

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,799
hired a system administrator at this

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,320
time

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,159
up until then um

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,679
all the infrastructure services all the

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,640
system administration done

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
had been done by volunteers on their own

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,960
time

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,760
um and in 2006 that kind of like became

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
untenable

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,200
i mean we wanted to ensure that there

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
was you know as little downtime as

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
possible

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,279
um and there's only so much you can do

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,960
with volunteer

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,559
services volunteer help volunteer

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,960
contributors and so

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
again abiding by the idea that asf

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,039
doesn't pay for development

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,559
ever um it did make sense to hire

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,720
assistant men such that

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,480
if there was something wrong at 3 00 a.m

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
in the morning we had somebody

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,400
on staff one call that could take care

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,080
of it we also started the asf

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
sponsorship program at this period of

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,919
time

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,640
uh up until then uh really the only

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,400
source of

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,200
revenue for the asf was uh was apache

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
cons

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,039
uh the conference events and the in the

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,679
income

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
from there we decided that hey you know

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
we're going to be

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,720
doing and growing a lot more we need

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,080
some way of companies donating to us to

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
us to

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,000
push down to the next level to be able

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,159
to upgrade our hardware maybe hide more

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,760
higher more assist admins do more of the

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,720
kind of work that we wanted to do

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,000
to support our projects uh and finally

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
in 2006

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,279
we completely sucked down cvs with

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,720
subversion

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,480
now as our main uh source uh version

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
control system

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,080
uh the year after that there were a lot

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,400
of projects coming on board

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,279
uh the website was getting quite stale

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
looking very

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,840
very old and there was a big change over

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,360
within the board it was the first time

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,120
at least in my opinion

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,760
that um all the directors were what i

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,880
call

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
second generation that is not uh not

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,960
official

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,520
uh asf founders um i've been on the

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,480
board

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,279
um you know from the very very beginning

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,480
up until

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,400
last year or so so i was a director for

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,960
almost two decades but this was the

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,760
first time that except for myself

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
no one other else no other director were

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
a

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,039
founder as well and i found that kind of

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,960
significant

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,080
because it meant that we were doing

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,240
pretty good

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,760
in educating mentoring stewarding

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,080
the second generation of apache people

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,279
of apache believers inside there

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,159
so much so that they were elected to the

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
board

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,840
there was a major refresh to the site in

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,960
in 2008

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,640
um a lot of um

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
you know growth uh infrastructure was

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
growing so much so that in addition to a

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
assisted men we actually hired didn't

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
hire reappointed

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,720
uh a vice president to actually control

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,799
that up until that time

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,559
the president that had been their major

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,520
uh

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,919
role was watching their infrastructure

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,880
um

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,600
and also was curious in 2008 that the

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,279
asf

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,320
won um you know the the jcp

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,760
member of the year award for the third

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,200
time

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,799
third time in a row so the asf

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,080
had a huge really really good

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,559
reputation inside the jc

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,520
penny it was a very valued member in the

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,200
in the jcp

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,240
ec um and people

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,720
liked us inside there so what was really

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
weird

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,840
is that we'll see a little bit how that

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,039
kind of like came to hit us

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,960
in 2009 was a 10-year anniversary um

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
you know our budget at the time was

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,320
maybe about

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,440
40 000 400 000 a year which included

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,159
everything um the number of projects as

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,799
you can see

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
on the website was huge so the very fact

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,520
that we were able to do

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,919
all that with such a small amount of

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,880
money was kind of uh kind of incredible

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,240
um and we did some uh spine tuning

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,480
inside the asf

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,919
to make sure that projects and

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,399
committees were focused on the things

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,320
you were

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:06,080
talking about 2010 was an incredibly

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,440
um important time in the asf history

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,840
the uh relationship between the asf and

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,000
the

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,679
jcp really came to a head really soured

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,240
um one thing that happened was that ibm

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
dropped harmony harmony was designed

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,320
basically to be

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,720
a java runtime environment permissively

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,080
licensed under the apache license

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,840
um and ibm at this point

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,679
at that time said you know what we're

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,840
not going to support harmony we think

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,720
open jdk is the way to go

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,799
and all of the ibm employees who were

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,159
paid to work on harmony

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,159
if they still want to work on harmony is

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
fine but we're not going to support it

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,000
which really was painful for harmony and

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,279
we'll talk about that in a little bit in

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,799
the lesson learned there

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,679
the other thing that really came to a

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,559
head was that

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,880
one of the conditions of us joining us

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,520
being the asf joining the jcp

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,559
was that we would be able to release our

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,000
source code

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,960
um our projects under an open source

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,399
license

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,000
one of the things that the open source

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,600
definition requires is that

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,600
there are no field of use restrictions

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
associated with the code you can't say

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,399
oh you can use it here but you can't use

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
it here

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,600
the problem was that oracle and this is

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,200
something they inherited from sun

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,520
had a um a field of use restriction

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,799
on the tck which was the test kit

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
basically

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,559
you couldn't use or you couldn't test

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,039
your implementation

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,480
on this tck because you would bump into

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,320
this field of use restriction

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
which meant you couldn't call it java

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,159
which meant the use or the value

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,200
of an apache project in the java

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,520
community

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,120
didn't make sense you know how can we

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,640
release something as open source

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,399
when we can't release it open source

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,240
because it requires a field of use

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
uh restriction inside there there was a

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,159
lot of discussion a lot of debate

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,159
we were really complaining about a long

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,960
time we actually sent an open letter to

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,440
java

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,080
and we said this has to stop this is not

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
good

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,200
um you really didn't get a lot of

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,159
support associated with that obviously

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,880
because people

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,399
companies had requirements and

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
restrictions on java

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,120
we left the jcpec that was a big hoo-ha

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
um and one of the major things that the

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,519
asf did

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,120
to help prove again our insurance

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,880
that community must come first

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,679
uh the apache harmony project was

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,960
terminated uh mostly again because the

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,080
number of

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,000
ibm employees were no longer doing that

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,360
uh were no longer paid to be able to do

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,080
that they didn't have the time

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,720
to code a code against it and it showed

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
again

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
i guess this is kind of like you know

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,440
our third major hit is

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,640
that diversity inside of a project

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,480
is vital um such that you can't have a

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,279
project which is really really heavily

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,240
dependent

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,720
on a single company supporting because

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
if that happens if the company no longer

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,039
you know worries about that

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,600
then it'll affect the project and so we

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,080
hired that

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,000
to be we learned that as well we hired

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,679
our first only executive assistant

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
because again the workload became too

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,440
much and we were subpoenaed

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,720
in the oracle versus google uh thing

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,799
and in 2012 the jcp office was finally

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,480
dissolved inside the asf

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,200
uh apache 2.4 was was released

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,240
the budget became about a three-quarters

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,640
of a million dollars

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,799
uh you know and then um in a way to move

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,720
the president position to more of a

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,480
chief operating officer

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,519
we move some um some offices some roles

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,600
some tasks

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,960
uh design that we're ex you know

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,720
executing operations

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
we move them under the president instead

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,679
of being under the board

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,720
so basically everything that concerned

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,760
itself with executing operations removed

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,600
under the president

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,039
and i'll talk about why i was concerned

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,679
later on downstream

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,399
in 2013 we grew like crazy we held our

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
25th

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,960
apache con in 2014 we hit our 2

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,080
millionth code mark when

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,960
just a couple years ago we hit

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,039
basically you know one and our budget

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,760
exceeds one million dollars for almost

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,960
the first time

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
you know ever in the history in 2015

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,360
we continue the growth plan in 2016 we

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,919
decided you know what we're going to do

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,600
we are going to create a whole new

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,320
branding for apache

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
so we have new logos uh the website got

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,440
a major refresh

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,960
and we provided a lot more capabilities

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
and functionality for people to be able

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
to

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
you know send that to you know use those

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
those logos as well

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,480
and we saw the growth of the third

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,600
generation of asf

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,799
asfers uh inside there

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,880
in 2017 um realizing that growth was a

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,960
major uh plan for us

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,720
we started figuring out what is our five

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
year plan what should we go

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,840
where should we go how should we get

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,880
there uh

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,960
created formal really nice slick

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
annual reports that were designed not

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
just for the is

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,079
irs but for everyone else for the entire

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,879
public out there they're available

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,000
under our public records um and also in

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,040
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,480
this is more of a a a personal note we

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,240
really started wondering

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,200
what operations were what roles actually

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,919
execute operations as i said before a

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,399
couple years

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,960
but before that it was kind of kind of

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,000
clear

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,440
if you had a role that required um

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,079
immediate decision making that were 100

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,040
operational then obviously it made sense

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,159
for those to be

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,960
under the president um but

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,760
the couple years or so around that we

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,639
saw a lot

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,359
other a lot more projects and roles and

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,480
tasks go

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,639
under the venue of the president some

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,839
roles and tasks which whether they were

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,800
operational or not

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,440
were kind of like open to debate open to

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
discussion

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,920
open to consideration in 2018 we had

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
about a 200

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,599
yes um i would just like to give you

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,280
your 10 minute warning

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,200
okay perfect thank you 10 minutes

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,359
perfect

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,560
in 2018 we hit about 200 million lines

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,760
of code uh we publish an asf

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,760
vision statement we pass our first audit

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,280
uh and audit is something that goes

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,800
through and make sure you're

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,560
counting books for up to snuff and

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,480
things like that um and

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,240
2018 it's the first year uh since the

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
very beginning of the asf

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
that i decided you know what i'm not

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,400
going to accept the nomination

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,160
to to run for the board i'm not going to

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
accept the nomination to be

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,480
uh you know to run for run for as a

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,520
director

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,560
um you know it's time for me to

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,480
let that go uh to ensure that

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,760
the seat which i had been basically

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,480
sitting at all the time

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,520
was really open and available to to

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,359
other people

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:04,560
as well uh in 2019 uh there was

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,200
a return of jakarta

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,359
but not jakarta as it had been known

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,280
it's basically the jakarta uh

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
double e project which is under the

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,400
eclipse foundation

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,280
uh they had been you know kind of ironic

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,800
alert is that it was really decided at

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,040
this point in time that

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
what we need to really control and

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,200
manage job in the java community

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,440
is really an impartial foundation

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,599
um kind of like what we were talking

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,280
about and the asf was promoting for

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,200
years and years and years but it finally

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,960
became fashionable to admit that

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,560
uh and that became and that got moved

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,920
over to the eclipse foundation which was

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
a wise move the

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,440
foundation was a good choice for that

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,960
they wanted to

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,560
figure out what kind of name to use

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,960
jakarta was a great name

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,839
we had used it a while ago they asked if

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,680
they could use it

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,960
we said yeah sure and so that's the

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,680
reason why

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,200
there is this entity this project under

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,920
eclipse called jakarta

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,599
which other than the name has no

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,320
association with jakarta

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,359
from the asf we also saw another project

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,480
come back

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,880
um there was uh and this year

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,160
i guess the second major change in the

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
board of director

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,280
uh uh in general every year or so we'd

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,760
have maybe

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
two directors change we have a nine

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
person

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,960
uh board um and then you know every year

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
we would re-elect

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
um and re-nominate new people and on

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
average you know one

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,599
two maybe three of those seats would

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,079
change

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,160
um we had a large change in in 2019

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,320
uh because of a lot of different issues

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,240
that have been very well publicized

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
uh two of the directors including one

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,560
who was the chairman of the board

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,240
decided to resign from the board as well

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,240
as the executive vice president

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,640
resigned from the asf and the

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,400
replacements were uh were installed

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,320
at that period of time in 2020 we said

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,680
goodbye to apache labs which is

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,800
basically a sandbox

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,320
for people to talk about and

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
play around with we figured what was

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,520
github out there there was really no

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,400
reason to have

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,240
um you know apache infrastructure used

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,680
for a sandbox environment

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
we had a release of our feature length

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,800
film

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,880
called trillions and trillions served um

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,920
and it's available right from the asf

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
website

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,280
uh our next year's budget is close to

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,240
two million dollars it's expected to be

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
1.7

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,400
million dollars and i think the biggest

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,839
thing that

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,880
i find extremely good uh and extremely

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,000
heartwarming

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,720
about this year in the coming years is

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
that i

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,000
i think it goes without stating that the

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,240
relevance of the apache software

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,800
foundation in the open source community

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,359
has kind of like waxed and waned and

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,480
waxed and waned and waxed again somewhat

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,359
over the years

00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,000
and i think with this refocus on the

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,720
value prop of what the asf is the

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
refocus

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
on project health with the eye towards

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,400
the future

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
a refocus on the projects being the

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,119
focus of the foundation

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,599
rather than the foundation itself being

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,200
the be

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,960
all end-all i think it really

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,000
re-energizes the importance of the asf

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,359
within uh within the community

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,720
so the current status and these are

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,839
basically the slides i'll go through

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,079
very very quickly

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,079
uh this is basically as he said before

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,520
you can look and see how the change in

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,800
the directors have happened

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,079
this green line right here is uh is me

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,920
as you can see from the very very

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,119
beginning but you can also see the

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,880
changeover uh

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,640
you know we have a number of directors

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,720
who you know very very new

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,160
in fact in many ways uh you know the

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
current uh board

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,160
was uh was a lot of people with no

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
current board uh experience and that's a

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
good thing

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
um it's good to have fresh eyes and

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,960
fresh voices moving inside here

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,640
there is a lot of interconnections

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,599
between the various apache projects

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,640
inside there

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,720
this is a pretty nasty graphic that

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,400
basically shows that but it also shows

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,760
the importance of community of

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,760
code sharing inside we have a

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,160
lot of top-level projects this is

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,599
basically a graphic showing the logos

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,560
of all of them uh quite a long way from

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,359
just maybe 20 years ago we only had two

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,160
podlings

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,160
are projects which are inside the apache

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,599
incubator with the hope to graduate to a

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
top-level project

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,119
and we also have a number of projects

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,359
which have really

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,960
done everything they retire they needed

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,800
to do retired

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,520
and went to what we call the apache

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,160
attic as well

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,240
most of our projects are in java there's

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,240
really no rhyme or reason about that

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,079
but we also have projects which are

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
really under almost every language you

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,960
could possibly

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,079
think of some slides here with the

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,599
number of growth in

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,240
projects and committers and things of

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,599
that nature we've grown like crazy we

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,680
will continue to grow

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,960
and we will continue to promote the

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,760
apache way

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,800
um to the world at large so i ask you as

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,640
a main takeaway

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,560
please support the asf if you have any

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,800

or so for for q a

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,599
i don't know if there are any uh

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,119
questions or answers

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,079
well i don't know if there's any answers

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,960
because i don't know if there's any

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,800
questions

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,319
but anyway again thank you for for

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,520
attending there's a lot

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,200
a lot to soak in um i appreciate

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,960
everyone's attendance and i hope

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,079
everyone really enjoys

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,359
the rest of the day for atm i've been

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
promoting ato

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,880
since the very very beginning i think

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,000
it's a great conference so

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,240
um if this is your first hto it won't be

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,040
your last i promise you

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,440
so with that i will uh head it over to

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
the

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,079
moderator to see if there are any uh

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,160
questions that have popped up

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,520
um and let me oops i think i saw

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,760
something in q a

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
uh pop up so let me put on my specs so i

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,200
can see

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,800
and see what that q a is uh you said

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,319
that you would not run for the board

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,400
again 2018

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,440
what led to your decision to step back

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,359
at the time

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,680
um that's a great question as i said

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,440
before basically every time i was

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,040
nominated to be on the board

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,680
i was always elected i was always

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,240
handily elected either like the

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,520
first per second or maybe even the third

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,599
person nominated

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,760
in so it was pretty much guaranteed that

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,200
i would be a have a spot on the board

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,040
and the way i was thinking about it is

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,920
like that's kind of selfish it's kind of

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
conceited

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,280
um you know first of all i didn't like

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,760
being you know

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,880
looked at as sort of like the official

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,800
face and voice of the asf the asf is not

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,680
a benevolent dictator for life

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
um we don't like having those kind of

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,760
people who

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,760
are you know mr and mrs uh apache

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,800
and it was really getting kind of like

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,240
lumped in with that

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,160
i wasn't comfortable with that and that

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,000
was one reason and the other reason why

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,800
is because by me constantly

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,760
accepting the nomination um even though

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,480
it was a nine

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,160
member board and there were nine seats

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,720
really available

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,079
really with me it was always going to be

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,040
eight seats available i didn't feel

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,119
right about that

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,880
so in 2018 i said you know what it's

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,560
time for me to just step away

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,960
i can be much more useful as a member

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,000
you know and speaking as a member rather

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,720
than having that

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,920
director hat always associated with what

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,359
i was talking about

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,480
so great question uh uh thank you for

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:40,240
for asking it um any

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,960
what it's time it's a quarter past the

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,520
hour

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,079
uh thank you again for attending again

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,560
um

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,079
feel free to contact me free to connect

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,800
either by linkedin and twitter

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,800
have a great day cheers all thank you

00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
again

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,160
