Abstract: For the last 20 years, the GNOME Foundation has been the nonprofit entity that enables the GNOME Project to achieve its goals. Founded to solve the financial problem of how to fund free software, we have learned through the years what being a nonprofit entity means for the GNOME project and what it allows us to do. In this talk we will discuss some of these issues and how we have adapted into the GNOME Foundation we are today.

my name is rosanna yin

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,759
uh i am the director of operations for

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,240
the gnome foundation

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,960
um i appreciate you all coming out and

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,359
joining my talk today my first

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
contribution to the gnome project

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,800
was in 1998 and i have been an

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,439
employee of the foundation since 2006.

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,160
i did grow up in the new york area so i

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,840
apologize in advance if i talk too fast

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,000
i'm trying on working on that today

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
i'm going to be talking about the gnome

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,680
foundation

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,480
then and now

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
so let's start with a quick overview of

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,120
what the gnome foundation

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,399
is uh we are a us

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,879
501c3 nonprofit corporation

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
that means we are stewards of the gnome

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,600
project

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,040
and we are the legal and financial

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,320
entity that represents that project

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,360
we are overseen by a board of directors

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,479
who are elected by the membership and

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,920
the gnome foundation is has

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,479
paid staff to keep things running

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,720
traditionally the gnome foundation has

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,960
taken a supporting role

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,720
which means we work towards making sure

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
that the gnome project succeeds

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,079
so let's set the scene here uh we're

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,680
going back in time uh it's the mid 90s

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,159
the 1990s microsoft was

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
everywhere if you owned a personal

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,320
computer

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,399
chances were you are running windows 98

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
technical workstations used to be

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,040
dominated by

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
unix but windows nt was making inroads

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
into that market

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,600
because it was cheaper and easier for

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,160
people to understand and use

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
linux was starting to be a viable unix

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
replacement

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,680
and desktops were popping up left and

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,680
right as people tried to fill that niche

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,040
in august of 1997 the gnome project was

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,800
started to create a free desktop

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
using a free toolkit by free i obviously

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
mean

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,160
free and open source but at this point

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
in time

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,280
that term had not been coined yet

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,840
by december of 1997 red hat had created

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
the red hat advanced development labs

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,480
where they hired a handful of folks to

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
work

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,760
full-time on gnome other companies

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,480
followed suit

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
and moving forward a little bit in march

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
of 1999

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,159
gnome 1.0 was released

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,800
it was not a success uh if you were

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,760
around back then or have heard stories

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
it was not definitely not one of our

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
better releases

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,200
in a rush to get that release out the

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,800
door it had not been properly tested

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,200
a huge push followed for improvements

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,239
and stability

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,879
by october a stable version of gnome was

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
released

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,360
and it was called october gnome

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
this free this release was relatively

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
usable

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
i started using gnome as my primary

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
desktop

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,280
at this point and have been using it

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,920
ever since

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
the following year in february

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,760
slashdot.org

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,159
announced their first ever beanie awards

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,239
they had a lot of different awards from

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
the silly to the sirius

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
these prizes were awarded based on votes

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,760
from the general public

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
the top prize was for most improved open

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,319
source project

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,560
and the gnome project won this award

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,439
mainly because people had seen so much

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,400
improvement since the 1.0 release

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
this reward this award came with three

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,760
came with a thirty thousand dollar

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,440
prize money package

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,600
about a month later in march we had our

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,400
first gnome conference

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
it started off with someone at a local

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
university in paris

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
inviting a few folks to come and talk to

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,080
the students

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
the developers that were invited thought

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,280
it might be nice to get

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
more folks together and hold some

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,240
workshops

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
they talked some companies into

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
sponsoring flights for

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
developers and they were able to get

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,360
over 40 contributors to show up

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
the first squatting conference included

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,600
contributor contributors from

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
red hat sun record systems and ibm

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,520
so during this first squatting uh some

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
of the folks got together

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
to socialize in the evenings after all

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
their work was done

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,280
and they would hang out at a local cafe

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
and while there

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,639
they would start discussing what issues

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,919
they thought

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
were keeping gnome back

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
some of the issues that they discussed

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
included

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,960
the fact that companies wanted to

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
support gnome

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
financially but they didn't really have

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,240
a good way to do it

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,320
paying developers is helpful yes but

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
that doesn't help with coordinating a

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
free desk

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
a free software project that has

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
developers

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,080
and viewpoints from different companies

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
companies wanted a single source to talk

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,039
to and deal with

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
about all things gnome gnome needed a

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
way to distribute funds

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
we already had that thirty thousand

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,160
dollars in prize money

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
and it sounded like companies wanted to

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
give more

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,560
but who would decide where and how this

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,880
money would be spent

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
we needed someone or something to hold

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,199
on to the gnome assets

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,319
and we needed a way to make sure gnome

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
keeps going

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
regardless of whether any individual

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
contributor

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
is still around

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
so the solution these folks at the cafe

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
came up

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,160
with was to create the gnome foundation

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
the gnome foundation is able to invoice

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
and receive

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,120
funds from interested companies

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,479
the gnome foundation is a non-commercial

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
point of contact

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,759
for companies to work with we also act

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,759
as a mediator between some of these

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,479
companies

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
the foundation can plan and finance hack

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,520
fests

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
and conferences and invite all

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,720
developers

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,919
to attend the gnome foundation can hold

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
copyrights

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,360
trademarks and other assets including

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
bank accounts

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000
having the project tied to the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,960
foundation means that it isn't a tie to

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
any single person

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,360
so what is the gnome foundation

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,360
we are a 501c3

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
nonprofit corporation based in

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,560
california in the united states

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,639
that means that donors in the united

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
states can make

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,599
tax-deductible donations to the gnome

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,080
foundation

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,919
otherwise a 501c3 is run a lot like a

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,400
for-profit corporation

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,199
except that our shareholders are the

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,199
general public

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,560
next i will be talking about the

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,560
structure of the gnome foundation

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,479
the base of our of the gnome foundation

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
is our members

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,199
memberships are for individuals only

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
companies cannot become foundation

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,599
members

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,800
in order to become a member you have to

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,120
be a genome contributor

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,400
memberships are valid for two years and

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
they can be renewed

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
foundation members can run for the board

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
of directors

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,759
they can vote in elections and they can

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,599
suggest

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,160
referenda foundation members

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
are also first in line to for travel

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,440
funding

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
to gnome events and other sponsorships

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,479
so in the year 2000 we had 372 members

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
of the gnome foundation

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,640
anyone who contributed was eligible to

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,959
become a member

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,720
folks with cvs access were told they

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
could add themselves to the membership

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,080
roster

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,720
those were simpler times and while it

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
said

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
any contribution anyone without cvs

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
access

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
that was our repository at the time had

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
to jump through

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,600
extra hoops to join so it was mostly

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,880
developers in the membership roles

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,440
today we have 219 members

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,080
membership requires a non-trivial amount

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,440
of contributions

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
application form is found online at that

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
url

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,480
on the slide this is the same form that

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,200
needs to be filled out for renewals

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
the form explicitly welcomes applicants

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,839
who have contributed

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,839
code translations advocacy

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,160
infrastructure outreach and

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,640
documentation

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
uh we la we added this last statements

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,560
because for years

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,240
people who did not contribute code but

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,720
did contribute in other areas

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
did not feel that they could be members

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,959
and we wanted all contributors to know

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,240
that they are welcome

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,360
we also currently have 64 emeritus

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,360
members

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,640
emeritus members were once full

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
foundation members

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,399
who still want to be part of the

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
community but they do not meet the

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
contribution criteria to renew their

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
membership

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,800
emeritus members cannot vote but they

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
can keep their blogs and their gnome.org

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
email alias

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,320
if an emeritus member starts

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,240
contributing again

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
they can reapply for full membership

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
next i want to talk about our board of

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
directors

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,920
our board of directors is made up of

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
volunteers elected from the foundation

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
membership

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,120
to steer the foundation directors on the

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
board

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,399
are serve on the board as individuals

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
and

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,040
not as an employee of the company that

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,800
they may be working for

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,079
even so our bylaws it is explicitly

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,079
uh mentioned that no more than one third

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
of the board of directors at any one

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,640
time

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
can be employed at the same company

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,360
so the board of directors originally had

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,600
11 seats it turns out that

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,440
that was too many for a foundation our

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
size

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
in 2002 we decreased that number to

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
seven seats

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,440
and that's what it's been ever since

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
originally

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,959
the length of the term was one year and

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,760
we had

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,920
annual elections for every seat last

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,279
year we changed the length of term to

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
two years

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,440
the seats are staggered so that each

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
year about half the seats open up for

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
elections

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,880
as an employee of the foundation i have

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
to say that this change was so very

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,000
welcome

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,920
prior to that i would stress that

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
personally every year around election

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,959
time

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
about the possibility of having a whole

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,120
new board

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,160
with completely new directors continuity

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,160
is a very good thing

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
meetings originally were held monthly

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,839
and if you notice

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
they're now held monthly however it

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,560
hasn't always been the case

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,360
it actually went to bi-weekly and then

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760
weekly

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
and then back to bi-weekly and only in

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,200
this past year has it gone back up to

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
monthly meetings

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
it's really interesting how that's a

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
cyclical process

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
this is our current board of directors

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,760
in the gnome foundation

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,839
they come from five different countries

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,320
and three continents

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,480
uh speaking of cyclical i want to point

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
out federico who's there at the bottom

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
right

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,519
he was one of the founders of the gnome

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,800
project and he was also

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,959
an original board member in 2000 this is

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
his sixth term on the board he's come on

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,920
and off a few times

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
and we're very grateful that he's

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,639
spending time there on the board now

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,560
uh the other board members some of them

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,880
have uh

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
been board members for quite as well as

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,440
uh quite uh excuse me

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,240
for quite a while as well uh and we do

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
have

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
two members of the board who are new

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,720
this year so it's great to have new

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
blood

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
and have continuity

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,519
beyond the board we also have committees

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
committees are an extension of the board

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,760
of directors

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,519
our bylaws stipulates how committees can

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,200
be formed or dissolved

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,600
but does not name any committees by name

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
committees are created by the board as

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,160
needed

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,720
to fulfill board duties every committee

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
and every member of each committee needs

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,120
to be reconfirmed

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
annually by the board each committee

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,920
also has a director from the board on it

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,959
to act as a liaison between the

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,959
committee and the board

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,440
the gnome foundation started off with

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
just one committee

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,279
the elections committee and they were

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
there to handle the election of the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,680
original board of directors

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,440
as we grew so did our number of

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,839
committees

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
this is our list of our current

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,560
committees

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
the election committee became the

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,800
membership and elections committee

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,920
they now also process membership

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,240
applications and renewals

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
we also have the release team who handle

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
the gnome releases

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
twice a year the travel committee who

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,680
processes

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,120
applications for travel sponsorship to

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,360
gnome events

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
the compensation committee who does the

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,800
research and meets

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
to propose the compensation package for

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,320
our executive director

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
the code of conduct committee who

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
handles code of conduct issues

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
and the circle committee which is our

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,320
newest committee

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,240
their job is to help coordinate and

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
invite into the conversation

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,600
the software beyond corganum release

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,639
that is still dependent or otherwise

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,560
associated with gnome

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,959
some committees we have had through the

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,600
years were more ephemeral

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,480
they were created for a single task and

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,160
then disbanded once the task was done

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,639
for example a few years back we had

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,720
a hiring committee formed to help with

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
the hiring process for our executive

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
director

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,639
and once he was hired the committee was

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,639
disbanded

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,160
the gnome committee the gnome foundation

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,800
also has staff to keep things running

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,800
staff consists of both employees and

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,279
independent contractors

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,199
we all work remotely we have no office

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
the staff helps the foundation by

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,519
providing continuity

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,839
and fill in any gaps necessary to keep

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,839
gnome going strong

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,600
when we first started in 2000 we had one

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
employee

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,320
the executive director now we have eight

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,639
and a half people on staff

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,360
and that that there is me the director

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,360
of operations

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
remember when i said earlier that

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,279
companies aren't allowed

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,279
to have foundation memberships the

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,240
advisory board is where they can take

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,279
part

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,959
they can help the advisory board

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
is where they can take part in helping

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,720
shape to know

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,199
our advisory board is made up of a

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,480
combination of interested companies and

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,519
other non-profit organizations

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,920
the advisory board meets periodically

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,800
with the board of directors to give

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,839
non-binding strategic advice

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,240
they don't have voting authority member

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,959
companies pay an annual fee

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,959
nonprofits usually have free memberships

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,880
this is the list of the advisory board

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
members in 2000

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,079
and today note that there has been a lot

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
of change

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,519
the only two entities that have been on

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,079
the advisory board

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
since the very beginning are the free

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,839
software foundation

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
and red hat

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,799
i'd be remiss if i did not mention the

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,120
role of teams in the gnome foundation

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,079
while teams are essential to the success

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,839
of gnome

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,480
unlike committees they are not

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,880
extensions of the board

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,640
they are unofficial groups who work on

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,079
the gnome project

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
originally they were completely

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,880
volunteer-led

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
but as we have gained staff some have

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,760
become staff led

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,559
to ensure continuity and here we have a

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,200
list of some of our long-running teams

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,559
which include our design team our

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,520
engagement team

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
our localization team our documentation

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
team

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
and various conference planning teams

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
next i will be talking about some of the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,760
programs that the gnome

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,880
foundation does

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,520
conferences we don't just give talks at

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,240
conferences like i am doing right now

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,760
and we also run boots at conferences but

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,320
gnome also

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,559
runs conferences for our contributors

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,720
and users

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,679
we use these conferences to share our

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,480
work and plan for future releases

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:29,840
additionally it is an opportunity for

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,840
local communities to learn about gnome

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,360
as i mentioned in the beginning the

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,799
first gnome conference was aquatic

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,200
in 2000 we have had we have held it

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,080
annually ever since

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,640
this picture on the left is was from the

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,280
boat party in paris

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,039
i was at the first squad in paris but i

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,600
wasn't in the picture

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,200
i was a lot younger then and we didn't

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,440
have a code of conduct

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,799
at the time i didn't feel comfortable

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,280
going to a social event

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,120
and being the only female in the room

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,200
nowadays we do have a code of conduct

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,799
and we do have more diversity in our

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,080
conferences guadic is also where

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,799
we hold our annual general meeting the e

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,600
in guadalajara

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,960
used to stand for europe as you can see

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,080
on the map on the right

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,840
the blue pins on this map show where

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,840
all the guardex have taken place

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,760
now aquatic is no longer an acronym we

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
strongly believe that the locations of

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,520
our conferences

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
give us the opportunity to have gnome

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,160
outreach in those areas

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,880
that being the case we are trying to

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,440
move outside of europe and

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
throughout the world we had originally

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
planned

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
for aquatic this year to be to take

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,720
place in mexico

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,600
but unfortunately pandemic so

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,280
everything went online we're hoping to

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
be able to hold it there next year

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,880
though

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,760
and if you're free next year during the

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,679
summer

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,480
and want to go to mexico we would love

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,720
to have you at guadac

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,679
the gnome asia conference has also has

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,159
also been around for over a decade

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
you can see by the red pins here on the

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,159
map

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
where they have been held

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,679
the linux app summit is a conference

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,559
that we started and now co-host with kde

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
i couldn't fit that on the map uh but

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,400
the loss has been held

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,640
in portland denver and barcelona

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
and the fourth instance is coming up

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
next month

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,080
as i was just saying the uh

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,760
linux app summit and the next gnome asia

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
are both taking place in november of

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,919
this year

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,919
they are both online conferences and if

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,000
you are interested in learning more

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,799
about the linux app space

00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,240
or about gnome in general the links for

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,799
registration are listed on the slides

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,120
in addition if you have a talk related

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,360
to gnome that you want to give

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,280
the call for abstracts for gnomeja is

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,679
still open and i'm sure they would we

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
would

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
love to hear what you have to say

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,600
hack fests hackfests are opportunities

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,480
for

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,840
contributors to get together and sprint

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
the gnome foundation

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,679
helps with coordination and can sponsor

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,159
travel and venue costs

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
here is a list of a variety of hack

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
vests that

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,960
have been held the last two years though

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
i should note

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,240
that we have not had any hackfest since

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,919
february because of the pandemic

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,039
on this list are hackfest like uh gtk

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,799
documentation hack fest you know plus

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
rust we've actually had two of those in

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,280
the past two years

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
uh a parental controls hack fest board

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,159
of directors planning hack fest

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,559
a fractal hack fest a g streamer hack

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,760
fest

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,880
gnome photos hack fest a developer

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,919

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
fest

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
and engagement hack fest i apologize if

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,480
i've forgotten any

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,640
we have we try and have as many as we

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
can

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,159
outreach outreach is an

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,679
important part of the programs we

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
deliver

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,840
i've already mentioned before that one

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,960
of the reasons we move our conferences

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,159
around is to generate outreach

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,159
in new local communities

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
beyond that we are also currently

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,400
running the coding education

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
challenge the goal of the coding

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,240
education challenge

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,799
is to devise creative new ways to

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,520
promote

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,919
free and open source software to coders

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,960
in high school and college

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,440
this challenge is currently in phase two

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,960
and we have 20 teams working hard on

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
their proposals

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,799
it's really exciting and i'm really

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
looking forward to seeing what they have

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,400
to

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,799
and what they come up with

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
we also participate in internship

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,520
programs

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,039
through google summer of code and

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,600
outreachy

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,679
occasionally we will also run an

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,960
internship in-house

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,480
and that depends on funding and what

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,480
fundraising we have been able to do

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
the university outreach initiative is a

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,200
new program

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,880
that aims to create a bond between

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,520
educational institutions

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
and the gnome community we have some

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,799
community

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,600
members active in universities working

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,720
on making that happen

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,400
so those are the foundation of the gnome

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,880
foundation's top three program

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,320
categories at the moment uh outreach uh

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,320
conferences and hack quests

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,120
so next i want to talk about some

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
highlights from our history

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,320
the gnome outreach program for women

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,159
we noticed uh in the early 2000s when

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,400
looking at our applicants for

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
our google summer of code internship

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
program

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,320
that they were all males and we wanted

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,600
to change that

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,880
we started with an initial round in 2006

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,080
with three interns that went well

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,000
but there were some pieces missing in

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,120
2010 we rebooted this

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,760
program and we made some changes we

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,799
would run

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,159
two rounds a year to match with summer

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,919
in both northern and southern

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,880
hemispheres

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
if an applicant was eligible for google

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,760
summer of code as well

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,039
we would help them submit their

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,440
application through their first

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,880
internship internships could be for

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,520
other areas

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,799
other than coding so we tended to have

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,360
lots of

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,640
translators and uh documentation

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,039
internships in in the outreach program

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,039
for women

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,880
the gnome outreach program for women was

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,880
a success beyond our wildest dreams

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,720
so much so that i personally couldn't

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,440
keep up and it was my job

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,000
to work the back office to make sure it

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,000
was running

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,240
the program grew beyond what we at the

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,799
gnome foundation could offer

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,039
so in 2015 the program rebranded itself

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,960
to outreachy and moved to the software

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,039
freedom conservancy

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,520
we still participate in the program but

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,840
we no longer help with the running

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
day-to-day

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,970
so trademarks and other assets

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,440
part of being

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,240
[Music]

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,559
a foundation of the representation of

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,120
the gnome project means that

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,679
part of the gnome foundation's

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,799
responsibilities

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,200
is to protect our assets

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,440
if you remember from the committee slide

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
we talked about the circle committee

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
that committee is there to help

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,799
applications that aren't part of the

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,360
core gnome release

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,279
but part of our bigger ecosystem work

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,159
with gnome in ways that do not harm our

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,080
trademarks

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,360
they do other things as well but that is

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,360
part of why they exist

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,960
trademark battle with groupon uh in

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,000
early 2014

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,120
we all learned that groupon or the

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
foundation learned the grinnell

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,640
foundation learned

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,840
that groupon was launching a point of

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
sale device

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,880
and calling and planning on calling it

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,000
genome

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,200
and spelling it gnome

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,400
they had an initial filing of 10

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,720
trademarks

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
all variation of all variations on the

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,559
word gnome

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,559
or the letter g

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,720
we were told it would cost upwards of

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
ten thousand dollars to fight

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,559
to fight each one that's a lot of money

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,039
for a small nonprofit

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,360
our lawyer attempted to talk with them

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,400
but they didn't really engage

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,919
instead they filed for 18 more

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,559
trademarks

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
our advise our lawyer advised us we

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
needed to

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,919
start thinking about fundraising to fund

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
this fight

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
so we started a fundraiser and we sent

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,480
out a plea

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,520
the free software community was amazing

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,039
so i personally get an email every time

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,520
we get a donation

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,880
i filter those emails so as to not

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,440
clutter my inbox

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,520
however we had set up a new address for

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
this fundraiser and i hadn't set up a

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,520
filter

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,480
yet or turned off notifications for it

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,520
so that first night my phone kept

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,720
buzzing

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,360
on and on with more donations it was

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,440
such an

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,039
awesome feeling knowing that the greater

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,880
free software can and

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,640
free and open source community was there

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,200
for us

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,039
groupon got the message within days

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
groupon withdrew all their trademark

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,120
applications

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,000
the takeaway from that story is we are

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
grateful to have

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,640
excellent pro bono lawyers and that the

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,279
free and open source community

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,279
had our backs

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,279
so segway from that to

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,520
the patent dispute we had last year

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,320
the gnome foundation was sued for patent

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,600
infringement

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
for over one of our applications

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,600
we didn't think that the lawsuit had

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,880
merit but patent suits are

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,200
very expensive to fight with the help of

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
some

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,799
excellent pro bono lawyers we agreed to

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,279
a settlement

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,360
where the suit was dismissed and

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,279
rothschild patent imaging

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,960
granted release and covenants for the

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,320
entire rothschild

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,159
portfolio of patents and

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,520
to uh yeah for the entire rothschild

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,799
portfolio of patents

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,960
to any software released under an osi

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,159
approved license so that's any free

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,279
software

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:19,200
with open source initiative

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,840
approved license the takeaway from this

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,919
story

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,000
is we are once again really grateful to

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,159
have excellent pro bono lawyers

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,440
and we want the greater free and open

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,600
source community

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,600
to know that we have their backs as well

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,320
so looking ahead looking ahead at the

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,440
issues

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,440
uh that's the foundation is facing today

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,440
as long as this pandemic is still around

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
we need to find

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
alternatives to having in-person hack

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,559
vests

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,440
because of time zones and coordination

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,520
issues online hack fest tend not to work

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,200
very well and we are missing those short

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,200
bursts that push our product forward

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,559
fundraising it's been somewhat harder to

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,360
do

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,000
fundraising during a pandemic i'm sure

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
that's the case

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,640
with many non-profits so we're probably

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,039
not alone here

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,480
recruiting and maintaining a healthy

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,159
volunteer base

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,159
that's something we're always working on

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,559
improving

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
and i'm sure that every free software

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,520
community can

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:30,640
feel that uh what what we mean by that

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,919
and and are trying to do the same

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,799
and obviously our grand goal is to make

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,240
gnome great

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,240
and accessible to everyone

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,440
so this is a photo montage of our

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,360
aquatic attendees this year

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
we couldn't do a group photo since it

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,120
was a virtual conference

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,960
so we had folks send in a photo and we

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,039
put this together

00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:04,880
thanks for listening to my talk today i

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:04,880
