Abstract: For the last 20 years, the GNOME Foundation has been the nonprofit entity that enables the GNOME Project to achieve its goals. Founded to solve the financial problem of how to fund free software, we have learned through the years what being a nonprofit entity means for the GNOME project and what it allows us to do. In this talk we will discuss some of these issues and how we have adapted into the GNOME Foundation we are today.
