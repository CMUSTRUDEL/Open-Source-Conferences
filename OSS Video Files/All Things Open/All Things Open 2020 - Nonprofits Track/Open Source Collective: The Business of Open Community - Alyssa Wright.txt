Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Nonprofits Track

Abstract: Open source projects are the building blocks for over half of an organization’s products, services, and internal frameworks. Yet despite the proliferation of open source in the supply chain of an organization’s digital infrastructure, these blocks are often forged by unpaid communities. Businesses are not building with free and open source code, they are building on the invisible shoulders of communities. 

To collectively solve the invisibility of open source, we reframe the question. How do we design business models and licensing where not only source code is protected but also the people behind code? How do we see and sustain the people of open source?

Open Source Collective is part of a sustainability ecosystem designed to facilitate organizational contribution to open source projects. We design on all ends of a sustainability spectrum, ranging from automated tooling informed by dependency graphs to customized curations of contributor funds. We work to bridge organizational value to the open source communities that are more important to them.

This talk will cover the vision and work of Open Source Collective and Sustain OSS to build an open source economy that replaces “give and take” with “give and give”.

hi all

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
it's a pleasure to be here um as i said

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,799
i'm coming from open source collective

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,240
uh where we support with uh fiscal and

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,600
legal infrastructure

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,080
um over 2000 open source projects i

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
i thought i'd play for you today um a

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,960
video that kind of describes the breadth

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
of

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,480
our work um our history both the

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,680
projects that we support and the

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
partnerships that we're building and the

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,520
tools that we're building

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
in order to support like and sustain the

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
entire open source

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,239
ecosystem so screen share

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,239
we're going to make happen so one sec

00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,120
and good luck let me know if this works

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
who works on sustainability in the open

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,680
source ecosystem

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,360
the sustainability problem has been well

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,799
known in the open source community for

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
quite a long time

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,159
it was back in 2014 when the heart bleed

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
vulnerability

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
and openssl happened and it really

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,159
brought this conversation to the fore

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
but we knew about the problem even then

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
and here we are in 2020 and this problem

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
is still persisting so why is that

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,119
one of the reasons is because the world

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,759
of open source a distributed

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,280
collaborative commons-based approach

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
that's a very different world

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
from the world of companies capitalism

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,040
where most of the money is in our

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
society and getting those

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
worlds to connect is really challenging

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
the incentives really are different but

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
open source developers are motivated by

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
is different and are often very

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,320
underappreciated very

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
under resourced and yet somehow they're

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
still held responsible when things go

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,880
wrong

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
one example of this i want to tell you

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,560
about my friend dominic tarr we're both

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
from new zealand

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,479
and i run an overlapping circle so i've

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
got to hang out with dominic a bit

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
he is an incredibly intelligent and

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,399
incredibly prolific

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
programmer he has made hundreds of

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
packages on npm

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
that get hundreds of millions of

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
downloads per week

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,560
um he's a wizard and i mean that

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,160
literally this is a picture of him

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
uh giving a conference talk with a

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
doritos bag on his head

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
uh as a wizard hat he lives on a little

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
boat

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
um where she sails around wherever he

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
wants to go doesn't have running water

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,840
he has a solar panel

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,080
the point is dominic is free you cannot

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
buy him he doesn't really need money you

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
can't tell him what to do he works on

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
the code that he wants to work on he

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,160
builds things that he's interested in

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,239
he is intrinsically motivated one of his

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,959
projects event stream this is a package

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
that he made

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
many years ago had a problem recently

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
there was sort of a big dust up a big

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,800
scandal about it he had moved on he had

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,239
well moved on he said that he not only

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
had moved on from this package but he

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,720
made something else which he thought was

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
a better solution and then he moved on

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
from that and made something else which

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
is an even better solution and he's

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
completely over it but this package

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
event stream was out there

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
popular used by a lot of people in a lot

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
of people's dependency trees millions of

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
downloads a week and he was

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
having to continue to support it and

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
didn't feel

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
he wanted that responsibility anymore so

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
he's trying to walk away from it

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
and somebody reached out to him offering

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
to help maintain this package and it

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,360
seemed to be a good faith offer so he

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
gave this person access and then it

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
turned out that they were a scammer

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
and turned it into malware and he put

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,879
out a statement after this

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,000
talking about how he made this thing for

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
fun and if it's not any fun anymore

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
what is he meant to be getting out of it

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
why does he still have a responsibility

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,959
to continue to support this package that

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,480
he made years ago forever

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,480
while the people who are using it

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
currently are not contributing and he

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,360
said he sees two solutions to this

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,040
sustainability issue the second one here

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
that everybody should take part in

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
maintaining the code that they use

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
this is the sort of ideal of the free

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
software movement this is the pure

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,840
approach

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
the reality of maintaining a commons in

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
our capitalist society

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
is this first option paying the

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
maintainers

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
and that's the one that we work on

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
funding open source is hard

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
there's a lot of friction between those

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
two separate worlds there's a lot of

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
pain points and barriers between them

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,760
people have come up with a lot of good

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,160
ideas for how to support open source

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,040
each of these represents many success

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
stories but

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
also each of these methods has its

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
drawbacks

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
and no one of them has managed to solve

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,199
the whole problem for the whole

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
ecosystem

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
relying on volunteers we've just seen

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,040
why that is problematic

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
hiring devs in-house sometimes companies

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
can hire an open source developer and

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
have them bring their project

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,880
in-house and get paid to work on it

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
sometimes they can pay their staff

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
developers to make pull requests to an

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
open source project and that can work

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
but an open source project might have a

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
couple of founders or a couple of key

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,320
maintainers and be used by

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
millions of companies that can't all

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
hire those people and

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,800
even if you devote some of your staff

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,080
time to making pull requests there's no

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
guarantee that those pull requests are

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
going to be merged

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
and finally a lot of open source devs

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,360
are not hireable they won't work for you

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
you can't make them want to be an

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
employee of a corporation if they don't

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
want to

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
open core dual licensing services these

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
are all approaches

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,680
which can work and have worked but kind

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
of force open source maintainers to

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
become

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
business people if they don't want that

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,080
it can be not very effective

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,320
looking at this from the ecosystem point

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
of view and we don't want developers to

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
be stuck

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,680
maintaining something that they made

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
seven years ago and have moved on from

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
we want them to be making the next

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
innovative thing

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
and putting it out for the whole

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
ecosystem we all benefit from that

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,960
we don't want people to burn out and for

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
projects to implode that other people

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
are depending on we don't want to force

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,199
people to wear suits we don't want to

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
wear suits we want to enable people to

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,160
move on and for the project and the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
community to continue

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
so when it comes to donations our

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
approach is really about donations

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
to the project as a collective so that

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
the original founder isn't stuck and

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
even if they move on

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
the funding and the community can

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
continue to be supported here is a

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,520
really amazing

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,319
twitter rant about why it's so hard for

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,440
companies to

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,479
to donate to open source projects these

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,600
different worlds

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,600
are incompatible in many ways

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,880
in order for a company to give money

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,280
they can't just

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
send money to some random person they

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,319
have processes they have to go through

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,600
there has to be invoices there are

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
contracts that are assigned there has to

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
be a legal entity involved

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
um the person on the inside of the

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
company who's trying to make this happen

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
has to convince their

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,880
you know accounts payable people and

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
blah blah blah blah and most people who

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
are in these different worlds just don't

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,880
understand

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,639
how hard these things are for people in

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
the other world we're a bridge open

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
source collective is a bridge or an api

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
between these two different worlds

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,160
here's how it works once upon a time the

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,800
world was full of triangles

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,680
human organizations like companies that

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,720
are solid

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,120
top down and pretty inflexible

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
then the internet happened making it

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
easy for people to collaborate between

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
and outside triangles

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
as open communities working for a common

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
goal

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
call them circles collectives of people

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
working together

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,639
on software community projects activism

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
just about anything you could think of

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
this circle

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
is a collective called spherio they

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
build open source software

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,639
like many circles they're open and

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
flexible

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
spherio has contributors and users

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,479
around the world and it isn't owned by

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
anyone

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,680
it's hard being a circle in a world

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
designed for triangles

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
spherio sometimes needs things like a

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,120
bank account and a way to pay taxes

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,599
but they don't want to stop being a

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
circle the pyramid company

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,520
loves spherio's open source software

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
it's critical to their business

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
and they want to support it but in our

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
world triangles can only give money to

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,710
other triangles

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
because they need things like invoices

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,160
[Music]

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,000
open collective is a home for circles

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
and a triangular world

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,479
we provide the tools circles need to

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
thrive we make it easy for circles to

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
fundraise

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,080
accept sponsorship and pay expenses

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,840
without needing to become a triangle

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
everything on open collective is fully

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,160
transparent giving circles and their

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
supporters access to financial info

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
whenever they need it we take care of

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
taxes admin reporting

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,199
accounting so spherio can focus on their

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
code and their community

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
now circles and triangles can live

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
happily ever after

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,720
and together we can start smoothing out

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,680
the corners of this triangular world

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,919
open source collective is a non-profit

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
who offers a service where we take care

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,280
of

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
all of the painful stuff around sharing

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,759
money and supporting open source with

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,000
money

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
so that funders and maintainers don't

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,399
have to worry about it so they can have

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,560
a much easier time

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,200
and we call what we do fiscal hosting

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,959
because it is really similar to

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,959
software hosting with an open source

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,720
project you can either host it yourself

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
and take on all the work and bother of

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,279
maintaining

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
a server and your own instance and

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,560
updating it and blah blah blah

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
or you can outsource that and pay

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
someone else to host it for you you can

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
outsource the hosting of your legals

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,760
financials your bank account we take

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,839
care of all of that stuff

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
we have brought in over seven million

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,080
dollars for over two thousand

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,000
open source projects and that has been

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,399
paid out in over 5000 different

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
expenses and each of those represents a

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
plane ticket to go speak at a conference

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,880
a lot of stickers that's been printed

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,399
somebody's full-time wage for a month we

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
do have quite a few people making their

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,200
full-time living

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
doing open source and getting paid

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
through open source collective one of

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
those

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,160
is webpack their budget is around four

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
hundred thousand dollars a year through

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,200
our platform here's how they're using

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
some of the features you can set up

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
different tiers different ways uh levels

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
at which people can sponsor or

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
contribute those sponsors then show up

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
on your page where you can

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
thank them and celebrate the people who

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
are supporting you and also have

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
transparency to your community about

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,200
um who's putting money behind it the

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
budget is all transparent you can see

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
how much does this project have in their

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
balance and what are they spending the

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
money on

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
so this provides some accountability

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
back to the funders and to the community

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
i'll tell you about a few

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
different examples of people doing uh

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
interesting and diverse things with

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,399
their collectives

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,480
babel for example offers sort of a vip

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
support deal for their major sponsors

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,920
where you can get a direct line

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
to one of the key maintainers of babel

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,320
jhipster runs a very successful

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
paid issue bounty program where people

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
can come along and pick out one of these

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
bounty issues and if they solve it then

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
they get paid the bounty for that issue

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
and that's really reinvigorated their

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
whole project from the funder side

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
front end masters does trainings

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
technical training and they give a lot

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
back to open source and that really

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,720
stems from the founder of front end

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
masters has

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
personal experience as an open source

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
developer and just really understands

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,079
the value of open source and why it's so

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
important to give back

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
another example samsung next this is an

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
example of a large funder who we can

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,040
work with and by having a partnership

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
make the process of distributing out a

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,959
bunch of grants

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
much much easier for everyone involved

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,880
we can have one

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
contract and one financial transaction

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
they send the money over

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
and then they can just frictionlessly

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
distribute it out to as many projects as

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
they want to and it makes it possible

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
for them to

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
give out more funding and make more

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
grants to open source projects

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,279
once the channel is there once we have

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
that agreement and partnership in place

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,399
money can start coming through that

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
channel much more freely so

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
for example we have a partnership with

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
google um there was

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,279
you know a little bit of work to set

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,640
that up a couple of years ago but then

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
the other week i got an email from

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
somebody at google saying oh we're going

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,079
to send

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
through another half million dollars to

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
give to open source and it's just

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
that's all it takes that one line email

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
and it's all set and ready to go so i

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,079
really believe this is bringing in

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
more resources for open source projects

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,600
we work on the ecosystem level

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
and i think that's really key you know

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,399
we don't represent

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
any particular company or technology or

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,839
framework

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,760
our agenda is to be the voice for all of

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,480
our thousands of diverse projects under

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
our umbrella

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
and to support sustainability in the

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
ecosystem we are a non-profit and that

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
is our mission

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,279
and that makes some really interesting

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,399
things possible uh one of which is

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,720
sustain

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,079
so sustain is a coalition of people in

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
the ecosystem who want to talk about

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,200
open source sustainability

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,880
it started as a conference and that's

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
happened um three years in a row having

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,800
a large summit

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
and has really grown to more local

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,040
events a podcast

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
series working groups and we've been

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,639
able to partner with academia

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
corporations foundations

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
independent open source developers and

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,079
bring them all together because we are

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
that neutral ground fast responders

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,440
another great example

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,839
when coveted 19 hit when the pandemic

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
hit a whole bunch of open source

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
conferences and events were just

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
suddenly cancelled and the ecosystem

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,079
really relies on those

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
for funding and for lots of other

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,480
important aspects of community

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
development so

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
very quickly we were able to bring a

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,000
bunch of stakeholders together we held a

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,519
virtual fundraiser and raised 115

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
thousand dollars and put the call out

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,600
saying if

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
you if you need help if you need your

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
plane ticket refunded or you need

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
problems with your

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
venue or all this stuff that has to do

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
with event cancellations get in touch

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,000
and we will help you out

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,920
and we've also been able to do cool

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,680
things like cooking up volunteers with

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
projects in need and training people

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,240
about

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
how to host their event online for

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
example foss contributor funds

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,120
this is the brainchild of dwayne o'brien

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,639
from indeed and we've partnered up to

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
push it out into the world a false

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,800
contributor fund is where a company or a

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,120
university or any institution

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,800
sets aside usually a large budget and

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,519
then engages

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,120
their employees their technical staff in

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,920
deciding where the money is going to go

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,800
it means that funding actually reaches

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,160
the projects

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
that engineers actually really care

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
about and then also it's great for

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
employee engagement

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
and it just democratizes the whole

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,880
process back your stack it's a tool that

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,800
analyzes your dependency tree

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,839
tells you what your dependencies are and

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
then connects you up with ways you can

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,320
financially support

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
those dependencies it's only a small

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
part of a much bigger picture about

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
dependency trees so now we're partnering

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
up with other people

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,720
uh looking at dependency trees and

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,639
mapping the open source ecosystem

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,320
from the perspective of sustainability

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,720
and the health of open source projects

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,519
so

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
partnering up with osi and chaos and um

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
several other

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
actors in that space who are interested

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
in this question so we have an

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,160
integration with github sponsors where

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,399
you can plug

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
in uh your collective to github sponsors

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,120
and the money will flow through and that

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
enables you to sign up to github

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
sponsors

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,199
instead of as an individual with a

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
sponsor button on your personal github

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,920
profile

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,079
you can put a sponsor button on your

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,600
repo on your github organization page

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,279
and get make the funding go to the

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,120
project instead of a person

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,040
we also have integrations for accepting

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
bitcoin um and other

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
sort of external or third-party revenue

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,199
streams can be integrated into your open

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
collective budget

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,680
all of this is about us being a bridge

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
between those two worlds between the

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,320
world of open source

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
and the world of money and the

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,240
invitation is to get involved

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
support collective support the projects

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
that you use

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
uh start collectives for your projects

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,519
accept support

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
join our coalition initiatives i really

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,440
think the only way we're gonna solve

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,160
a sustainability question in open source

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,880
is by taking this ecosystem view and all

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,880
working together

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,839
great thank you

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,639
so that was a message from our executive

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,199
director kind of representing um

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
kind of the mission and breadth of our

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,959
portfolio of work

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
i don't know if anybody else has joined

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,600
since

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,440
we started but i

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
would love to answer any questions or i

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,240
can you know continue to

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
wax poetic on on any of the things that

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,800
we

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,800
kind of touched upon here um

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,959
there has there been anything that

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,959
surfaced that

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,600
and i'm just going to bring up my own

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,600
contact information

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:09,839
now

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:09,839
i can do that

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,839
sorry i'm not seeing the

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,120
anyway

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
does it make sense for me to just

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,360
continue to talk about this

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,800
topic of how we bring together like um

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,079
kind of business models and

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,720
open source sustainability it does there

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,720
are

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
that there don't appear to be any new

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,600
questions at this time

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
okay and yeah i see uh some attendees in

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
the

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
the waiting room like feel free to jump

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,639
in raise your hand

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,760
interrupt me etc um

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:10,000
but a lot of the kind of impetus of

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,839
um open source collective is because

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,120
you know i i think a lot of a lot of

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,959
this has either seen or

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,439
been involved with open source projects

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,919
um that you know are meaningful

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,079
and important um to their like technical

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
development but not necessarily a path

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
towards

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
raising like supporting themselves or

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,640
raising um

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,840
a family or uh has a trajectory of

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,799
either personal or or ecosystem

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,360
sustainability

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,880
and yet they often at times though not

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,919
always but often can be

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,960
really integral parts of big projects

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
um other projects or your friends

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
projects

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,320
they are you know part of a a uh

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
you heard the term like dependency

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,120
graphic part of our graph of

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,799
our um kind of technical development and

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
so open source collective is sort of

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
designed

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,280
to offer a a different

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,039
type of business model to sustain open

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
sources sustain the small projects and

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,120
sustain

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,240
large projects by um as alana was saying

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,039
building that bridge between those

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,320
projects

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,360
and the larger and smaller

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,080
um places where of contribution and

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,960
donation

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
so that we can you know so 80 i think

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
that

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,559
the numbers are like 80 to 90 percent of

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
technical projects rely on open source

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,679
technologies yet what is the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,280
kind of um identified value

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,400
and the return on of

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,960
of value to those open source projects i

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,799
i think has been both documented and we

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,559
can like feel it for those who are

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,000
part of open source like you know very

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,480
under under

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,480
um under uh

00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,480
how you know lifted um and so

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,400
open source collective um we look to

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
surface the importance of open source

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,200
projects in our technical

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,600
like development um and we look to build

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,520
like

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,120
easy pathways for uh entities again

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,039
whether large or small

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,559
to support those open source projects

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
and you might have heard like a number

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
of different

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
examples of our work it's around

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,320
partnerships

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,120
and that's a lot of what i am

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,240
look to build and so the dependency

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,679
graph partnership

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
on partnership with github partnerships

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,400
that

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
we're able to like form in response to

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
the kobit 19

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,160
kind of economic contractions all of

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
this is part of

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,320
our um our strategy

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,440
to work in partnership to sustain

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,160
open source community and you know the

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,799
like what happens if we don't sustain

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
you know

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
open source i mean these are important

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
questions

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,480
as well like if we don't uh kind of look

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,200
to sort of shift

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,360
the business models of of open source

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,000
there are

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,640
i think there are potentially a lot of

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,520
risks

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
um that that we also need to

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,960
balance as well so um

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,559
i don't know i can continue to kind of

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,080
wander and pontificate but

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
i'm wondering if any other questions

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,039
have sort of surfaced since

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:35,760
since since then

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:37,360
and welcome everyone who has joined

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
zai you listen to the whole thing is

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,679
there anything of either

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,440
i don't know the there was one screen

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
that really caught your attention or

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,159
something

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,919
that uh spoke to you maybe there's

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,440
something that i can respond to

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,880
more directly um i think that's a really

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,120
interesting

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,000
concept i i think it would be

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
interesting to talk maybe a little bit

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,280
about

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,120
about the you know about the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,679
impact not just that this has on a

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,360
global scale but on an individual scale

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:19,440
like it does like you know

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,640
what are what are some things that

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,200
you feel like this company is really

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,120
making a difference by doing

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,559
yeah that's an excellent question thanks

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,400
for bringing that up

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,679
um so yeah it's it's worth pointing out

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
like the scale

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,320
of sustainability is very different you

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
know some projects they want to be able

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,320
to

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,440
um hire a team of developers and

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,760
community you know uh leaders and

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,880
you know marketers in order to make um

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,320
and

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
that footprint sustainable and there are

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,880
some people

00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:01,120
um some projects that you know they

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,240
they're they're what will sustain them

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,559
is at a very different like place um and

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,120
yet

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,320
both are both are really valid um and

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,600
both are represented

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,240
of the um community those individual

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
communities

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,520
and so sometimes the

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
the most successful like projects that

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,480
we're able to support

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,840
don't necessarily get the biggest like

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,320
bank account but they get

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
enough so that they can hold events that

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,159
are valuable to them so that they can

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,720
give

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
stickers out to the people that are are

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,799
working with them that they could like

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,880
help

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,440
pay for some of the documentation that

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,600
is being developed it doesn't need to be

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,720
big and it could also like we've also

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360
noticed that

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
sometimes you keep a little bit of money

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,640
like you know

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,280
in your back pocket in case something

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
happens

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,200
you know say so it doesn't there are

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,880
some projects that have just

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
a couple hundred dollars that are

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,159
waiting in the bank account

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,640
for like that event that they might plan

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,360
when we all meet together again

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
or to help um support a scholarship for

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,520
somebody to come to

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,559
said event or like do a

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,400
t-shirt like printing and so those i

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,039
think are are just

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
i mean they're these are powerful kind

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,000
of

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,039
i think there's a powerful breath of

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
what it means to be

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:22,000
sustainable um and i think often we get

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,600
caught by the large numbers and the

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,240
um the scale of the impact of open

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
source

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,840
and the potential value that it brings

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
and

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
you know we can use lots of business

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,799
terms like the return on investment

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,840
etc etc but like it's also the small um

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,600
it's a small generosity of of people

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,760
and it's a small um uh there's a

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,640
there's a scale to the sustainability of

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,640
an ecosystem

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,480
what's your next question that was so

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,880
good

00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,320
so i'm putting you in the spot since i

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,570
can only be on the spot for so long

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,770
oh but emily brown just came in

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,770
[Music]

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,840
emily brown says what are some of the

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,120
best tools to help developers understand

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,120
their fiscal needs

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,960
i often run into projects that are

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
unsure of what their next fiscal move

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
should be

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,760
what advice would you give to them again

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,159
that's a really great question and i'm

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,159
not sure

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
i'm not sure any of us have like you

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
know one answer to that

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,080
um something that i learned recently

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,200
from a study that was at um

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,760
uh carnegie mellon is that

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,400
one of the things that they noticed was

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,760
that

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,559
the the projects didn't know how to ask

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,520
for money and so the most successful

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,240
projects for

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,880
um receiving money were often the ones

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,919
that had

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,960
um clear asks and

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,360
um and and so i would

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
my first thing that i would advocate for

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,279
actually

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,039
probably personally in life um but also

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,240
for open source projects

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,679
is to ask for what you need um and

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,000
if uh if if if you

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
as a project need money in order to find

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,360
some breath

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
um some space um some

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,240
support i i would

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,520
encourage you to find ways

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:38,640
to to start asking for physical support

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,000
but um but also in the cmu study

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,799
we saw a lot of projects that um did ask

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
for support

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,320
had to fit like had a kind of a bucket

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
of money like you know in their bank

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,520
account but weren't actually using it

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,080
and um i would

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,840
i would encourage like open source

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
projects

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,919
to either like potentially build a

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,080
conversation with somebody they know

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,840
or somebody in their networks i'm sure

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,039
or to reach out to us

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,720
about thinking about um like the the

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,279
rough

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
the rough framework of a of a business

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,120
plan

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,720
i mean and it doesn't need to be perfect

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,320
it's definitely not something that

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,279
um uh you're going to

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,240
you know need for something like you

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
know vc funding

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,000
we're not talking about that but we're

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,919
talking about um

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,520
what what is it that that you would like

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,960
to move towards

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,679
um and whether it's articulating your

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,919
roadmap whether it's articulating

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,880
more community and engagement whether

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,240
that's

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,200
articulating a kind of a marketing

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,919
like footprint i think identifying what

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,799
your

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,400
priorities are in like clear and concise

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,679
and aligned ways with the people that

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,600
you work with

00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,799
um are like the first steps towards

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,000
figuring out how to to where where to

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,640
put your

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,520
um your fiscal um

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,320
emphasis so does that answer your

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
question emily

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,919
and i i will say if to that this is

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
exactly the type of resource that we

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,240
hope that we provide

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,559
um at open source collective as well i

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,399
mean

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,080
we're definitely not alone in being that

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,919
sort of resource for you and there's a

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,840
lot of discussion forums that

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,960
are people you know also finding their

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,440
way but

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,880
please reach out to us on the slack

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,679
channels like

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
um you'll see we brought up the sustain

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,240
oss

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,240
like um website if you go there there's

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
a really active like discourse

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,440
channel about such questions as well and

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
so

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,520
all that all of there

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
this is um a shared question and i think

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
you know

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,360
similarly to like just the term

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
collective like it's a shared question

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
that i think collectively

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,760
um people are are trying to address and

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,760
solve together

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,039
was i gonna ask a question

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,480
[Music]

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
i was also gonna point out that you're

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
20 minutes from time

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,600
okay well and we can also like finish

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,120
early

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,880
but um but

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,840
yeah i'm is there so

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,960
yeah so i know you're here specifically

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,720
to speak on

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,000
the behalf of your organization

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,200
what do you do like what

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,559
what part of this are you

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,840
good question what does any must do um

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,120
that's fair yeah

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,240
um well so i come from a background

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,760
of well it's funny i often call

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
before so um

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,919
before working with open source

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
collective i often called myself a

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,000
bridge

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,000
um myself like i see like my role kind

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,520
of in this entire space as

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
a bridge um of of open source

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,039
development

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
and kind of engineering and its impact

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,720
um

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,600
in like the real world and

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,000
um and that bridge has a lot to do with

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,679
um

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,799
i've done like business development in

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,240
the past so specifically around you know

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,039
um like sales goals

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,919
but fundamentally whether it's for for

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,520
business or

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,520
otherwise my what i do is like build

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
partnerships that are mutually

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,520
beneficial to like the

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:49,120
open source engineering and the

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,720
the um the worlds that it touches

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,760
i i believe very much that

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,679
community health is is a part of of good

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,880
partnerships and being

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,159
that bridge between projects um

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,240
and and impact and so my role within

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,080
open source collective

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,279
is i see myself very much in the space

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,720
of that clue um i work uh

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:20,080
with open source um teams

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,919
hi there i work with open source teams

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,000
um within uh larger organizations

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,120
um both non-profit and in like the

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
corporate space

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,039
um connecting them to uh the open source

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,279
projects that we

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,799
provide you know the fiscal and legal

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,080
infrastructure for

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,360
so um i i try to

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,720
support the open source projects as much

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,520
as i can

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
by again connecting them with the larger

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,039
corporations but also

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,480
listening a lot to what the larger

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,360
corporations

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,159
need want how they find value i'm really

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,200
interested

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,760
in building tools to make this easier as

00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,919
well

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,279
the dependency graph work i think is

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
really fascinating

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,960
i come from an open source mapping

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,200
background and

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,440
building what i see is like sort of the

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
supply chains of our products

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,720
and understanding not only that there

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,399
are 80 to 90 percent of our projects our

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
products might be

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,440
based on open source software but like

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,840
where

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,120
are they in that like that building how

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,320
critical are they

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,080
um uh who

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,760
what is the health of those as opposed

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,320
to like maybe some of the others like

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,000
really

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,320
kind of visualizing and building and

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,519
understanding like the supply chain

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,799
of our of our products um this

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,519
this um this type of tooling um

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
is also my role at open source

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,919
collective

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,519
we are we're definitely a small team

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,799
considering that

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,559
we support over 2000 projects and

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,440
um actually at this point um

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,840
uh have like moved eight million dollars

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,080
um

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,000
from the last couple of years uh to the

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,519
to those projects

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,880
um it's a incredibly small team

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,399
and so like many different startups we

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,720
all kind of carry multiple hats so

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,320
that's that's a lot of what my role is

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
um within like the open source

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,640
collective

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,519
um mandate and mandate i'm not sure

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:28,000
that's the word right

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:30,000
either but that's what i do

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,320
any other questions and otherwise happy

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,840
to like call a short so

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,880
you can go to the bathroom at least and

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,880
other people can get ready

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,159

or open collect which is like the

00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,679
technology platform behind open source

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,039
collective

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,919
and and always at hello oscollective.org
