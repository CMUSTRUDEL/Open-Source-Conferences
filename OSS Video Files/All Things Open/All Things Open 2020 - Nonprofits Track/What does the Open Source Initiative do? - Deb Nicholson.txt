uh i want to thank like todd and danny

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,360
for

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,120
uh giving us a spot on the schedule i've

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,880
just joined the open source initiative

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,000
as a general manager about a month and a

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,800
half ago

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
um and so uh i didn't know we had a slot

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
so i don't have slides but i

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,400
am willing to take questions and talk

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,279
about our mission and talk about our

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,599
plans

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,199
and what we're going to be doing over

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,320
the next year or two

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,520
uh to kind of cement our

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,719
uh you know our mission into

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
more concrete action uh for folks that

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
don't know and are joining

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,840
um uh and haven't heard someone talk

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
about the open source initiative before

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
um

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
the open source uh initiative is an

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
organization that

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,360
uh stewards the open source definition

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,000
and so that's kind of

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,800
um the canonical place where we

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
describe like what open source is and

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
what kinds of licenses

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,119
uh qualify as open source and what kinds

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,479
of licenses don't qualify as open source

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,159
and so um that's uh that mission

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,360
is um one that we've been doing for over

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,320
20 years

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,080
um with a lot of different folks like uh

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
we're a nonprofit organization

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,720
and um have for a lot of our history

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
been led by volunteers and so

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
that means we've had a lot of turnover a

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
lot of different faces a lot of

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,280
different projects

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
uh and a lot of different initiatives um

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
and folks have probably had lots of

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
different conversations with people from

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
the open source initiative over the

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,040
years about our work

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
and the kinds of things that we're

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
supporting um

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,399
i would say that one of the things that

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,640
we do a lot of

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
is take a look at new licenses and

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
that's been something that's been

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,159
happening a lot more lately

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,079
which i think is really interesting it's

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,040
kind of an exciting time to be part

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
of the open source initiative when uh

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
you know we have so much

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
excitement around uh building new open

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
source licenses that

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,360
uh work with new technology working with

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,560
new landscapes and things like that

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
that said we're you know not um redoing

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
our mission and

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
re-tooling it to do other types of work

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,840
we still

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
care deeply about open source and making

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
sure that

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
open source is able to thrive and

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
flourish and that people have the

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,879
resources that they need to do that

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
so i'll open it up to questions i can uh

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,640
you know

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,560
talk a lot but that probably won't be as

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,360
interesting as hearing from

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
folks out here in the audience about

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
what they've been

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
you know what they've been wondering or

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
what they've been meaning to ask the

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,239
open source initiative about our work

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,480
and our plans and things like that

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,480
so

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
we did have a really interesting

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,400
question from the uh

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,319
last session about um

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,519
how uh newer licenses seem to have had

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,680
uh like a drift into

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
uh also covering patent lawn that's a

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,120
really interesting development

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,800
um for a lot of software's history

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,640
it only covered uh copyright law and

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
so uh because software is something that

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
you write um

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,760
we have uh we've like used

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
that as like so you write software so it

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
gets copywritten

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
um which is a little bit of a clutchy

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,680
fit also like the

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,080
um the idea of copyright was intended

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
for

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
like novels and um plays and music and

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,280
things like that

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,599
um and software is uh i mean

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,360
maybe your software is art and mine is

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,439
just a set of instructions but most

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
software is like some combination of

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,080
both

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,599
um and so copyright's always been kind

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,319
of weird fit so the um

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
the we've had to in open source more

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,720
broadly speaking

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
respond to the um legal landscape where

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
patents are being applied to software

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
and so that's

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,440
been really uh like a huge change that i

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,199
think the osi has embraced

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
um and so there's been some questions

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,040
like what else are we willing to embrace

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,199
um i don't see any huge uh sea changes

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,080
in like the legal landscape where

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
um you know we're gonna we're gonna

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
start

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,560
applying some other uh kind of field

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,479
uh or other type of intellectual

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,400
property law to

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,759
computers and software i feel like um

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
the biggest changes are not as likely to

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
come from the legal landscape like

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
already having patents and copyrights

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
applied to

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
software is kind of a lot and already

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
plenty of mess

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,440
um for folks who are trying to just use

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
software and

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
try and figure out like what they can do

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
and what they can't do so having like

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,080
two different types of

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,240
uh laws apply to the writing and sharing

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,639
of code is plenty already

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,919
but where i do think we might see more

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
stuff is

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,800
um the ways that hardware and software

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
relate to each other which has been

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
getting uh kind of like a more deeper

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,199
and interrelated intertwined sort of

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
relationship over the years

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
where it's a little bit hard to tell

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,840
like where does the

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,039
um hardware end and the software begin

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
when you have like

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,320
small chips that have like just a few

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,080
lines of code running on them

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,479
or um other little tiny pieces that in

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,320
your smartphone probably has like 30

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,919
different little devices that each have

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
a little bit of code in them

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,960
and so i think we are probably going to

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,600
have to look at some

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
new types of licenses that apply better

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,479
to the

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
mix of hardware and software that's you

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,759
know obviously going to just keep

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,280
happening

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
i don't know if folks have other

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,680
thoughts about like what places we think

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,639
more licenses are going to be needed or

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,199
other places where they think more of

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,039
the

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
um you know like that we're going to

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,000
have to respond to

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
another change in the landscape either

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
the legal landscape or the technical

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
landscape

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,319
but i would be happy to talk about that

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
with folks if people want to ask

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
questions

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,160
you can put questions either in the chat

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
or you can uh put them in the q a

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
like i can see them both uh the q a is

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,560
like down in the middle

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
and uh i would be happy to talk with

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
folks about

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
uh how they think the osi is doing what

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,400
they think we

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
should be looking at and what they uh

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,840
what they're wondering if we take a

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,479
stand on or um

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,120
have uh have been thinking about because

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,160
that's

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,199
it's a big growth year for us which um

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,280
is new uh if you were in josh's

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,440
last session he talked about nonprofit

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,400
organizations more broadly

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,160
um the open source initiative is a 501c3

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,240
nonprofit organization that's a

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,960
charitable mission-based organization

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
that

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,440
has a charitable mission-based focus

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,280
to educate and advocate and make it

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
easier for people to adopt and use

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,000
open source and so um so we stand

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,840
by that um but uh like many things

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,840
after over 20 years it needs a little

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,880
bit of a refresh

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,080
uh and so we've been looking at more

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,240
strategies that um you know

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,000
kind of meet the current moment a bit

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
better and so we've been having a lot of

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
these conversations

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,919
uh within the organization um if you've

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,400
ever been part of a nonprofit

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,479
um taking some time to sort of realign

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
and look at your activities and seeing

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
how well they are

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
accomplishing your mission for you is a

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,120
super valuable process i

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
highly recommend it myself like before

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
coming to free and open source software

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
now like

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,440
15 years ago i did a lot of work in

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,479
more traditional nonprofit organizations

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,199
and so

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
those organizations uh all kind of did

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
this like check in with their mission

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,000
and just like talk about what we're

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
doing and how well our tactics and

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,520
strategies are working each year

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,280
um or every other year and um i was a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
little surprised when i came to free and

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,639
open source

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,120
software non-profits that we never did

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
that

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,639
until now so that's exciting

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
again if folks have questions about like

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
what we're up to

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,959
or what we're doing i would be happy to

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,719
hear um

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,800
or take questions from folks in the

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,000
audience

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,000
for folks just joining us uh todd danny

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
from the all things open organization

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
where um

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,920
gracious enough to give us a slot here

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,560
and um

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,800
so i i don't have slides in particular i

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,480
was more kind of interested in what

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,040
folks have been thinking about and what

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,920
folks think is happening with the um

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
uh the you know the state of open source

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,720
and

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,839
um and where we could be going so

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
i don't know if people have some

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
questions

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,200
oh so we have one from uh

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
from josh simmons what are the best ways

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,519
to get involved with and support osi's

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
work

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
that's a good easy one right um thanks

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,279
josh

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
uh if you go over you can take a look

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,279
like we have

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,360
uh we have we definitely have a mailing

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,880
list that we send

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
that we send out to folks and talk with

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,480
them we have ways for

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
people to volunteer and get involved

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
with some of our working groups

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
if you are part of another open source

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
project

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,600
um we have an affiliate program uh today

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,959
we just added the.net foundation

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
to our list of affiliates um affiliates

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,600
are

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,320
able to participate in quarterly calls

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
about the

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,839
like open source at large and what's

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,720
happening in the community

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,720
um like sometimes commiserate about

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
shared challenges but also like talk

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
about resources that they

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,839
found um they uh our affiliates like

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,880
often share each other's opportunities

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
and events

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
uh and things that are coming up that

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
could be of interest to the larger

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,800
community and not just

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,040
their uh sub-project within the open

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,600
source community

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,560
we also of course have a membership

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
program where

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
you can be part of our membership and

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,519
elect

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
our board and have some input on the

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,279
direction

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,839
of the organization from that sense um

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
that's just one perk of course you can

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
also

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,440
um we we love like keeping our members

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
informed about what's happening and

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,600
what's going on with the organization

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,079
um and as we are adding more

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
like kinds of or like kind of refining

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,560
our mission like there's gonna be more

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
uh opportunities to get involved in

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
those

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
uh in those committees and in those

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
working groups

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,399
um and we're we're looking to sort of

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,200
deepen our engagement with

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,640
our affiliates and so um so there'll be

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,640
a lot of stuff coming down the

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,160
pike um we um

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
let's see um

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,200
if uh we if folks have like specific

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
things that they'd like to do

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
like if you if you really like licensing

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,399
we have like a mailing list where people

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
discuss that

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,079
um might not be staying a mailing list

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,720
forever but

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
um there is a lot of conversation on

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
there well sometimes there's a lot and

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
then sometimes there's none for a little

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,480
bit it goes up and down

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,279
uh and so uh that's another place

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,800
where people can participate and we're

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,600
looking at more ways to kind of like

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,440
convene conversations so that folks can

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,320
um discuss the uh things that are

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,160
happening with other practitioners so we

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
want to really make sure that

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
folks who are doing open source are able

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,519
to talk with other folks that are doing

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
open stories like whether from a

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
business

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,399
perspective or like a hobbyist

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,040
perspective or as a student

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,839
um yeah does anyone else have any

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,839
questions

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
cool um

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,880
i don't know if uh people saw josh's

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,079
talk maybe they got like a lot of their

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
questions out there

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,320
um he talked more deeply about like kind

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,839
of the wide range of nonprofits in the

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,040
space that they're doing for an open

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
source software

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
um and one of the things that we're

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
looking to do is to work more with

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
partners

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
um that are also working in this space

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
and doing

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,880
uh work on you know to promote and

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,040
advocate for open source so

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
um so we're we're always open to

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,200
conversations with other organizations

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
so that's another thing that if you are

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,160
part of another project and you think

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
that there might be places where we

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:07,600
could collaborate we would love to hear

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:11,360
from you

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
all right um

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
so um

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,480
yeah i don't know um

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,079
maybe people are being nice and they

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,519
don't want to ask like the

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,360
question they have or they think their

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,360
question is maybe to

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
minusa but um if you have something

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
that's a little bit more

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
uh you know nuts and bolts we can talk

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,279
to that too

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,880
uh so i have another uh what do you view

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,760
as the most challenging things

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,959
uh facing osi and open source more

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
broadly

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
uh that's a really interesting one and

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
it gets a little bit more

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,839
uh philosophical um i would say

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
that right in this moment one of the

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,720
things that we have is that we have like

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
a really

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
kind of like heavy

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,040
in one direction like folks who have

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
been here for a long time

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,839
um and have like a really specific idea

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,680
of like how open source should be done

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
and um and a lot of times they've

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,959
created organizations that are or

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,040
projects that um have kind of forgotten

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,600
how to be welcoming to newer people

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
and how to bring in like fresh voices

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,839
and fresh perspectives

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,480
um but at the same time we have like a

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,519
lot of

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,600
newer and often younger people who are

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
doing open source they're just not like

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,040
plugged in

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,480
um in some of the ways that we would

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,880
want them to be like they just

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
happen to be doing open source like i've

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
had this experience before when i'm

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,360
talking to someone about like

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,360
what they work on and they're like oh i

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
do javascript you know no open source or

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,519
whatever and i'm like oh

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,279
javascript's usually open source um so

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
you are probably working on open source

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
so we have a lot of opportunity where

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,560
folks are doing that work but they're

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,160
not

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,240
plugged in and they they don't

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,440
maybe have as many of the resources that

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,720
we would like to

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
be able to provide or they don't know

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
where to look for the things that um

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,639
maybe folks who have been here in the

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
open source communities a little bit

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,720
longer take for granted so

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,560
like i know you mentioned the open

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
source definition and said like you were

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
surprised to find out that there were

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,800
people who had been doing open source

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
programming for a while but didn't know

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,560
about the

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,040
open source definition and so you know

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,399
we're

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,800
uh i think like as a movement like

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:32,560
open source didn't really start with um

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,120
an innate love of marketing say and so

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,120
um so that's i think been a little bit

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
hamstringing us as far as like fully

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
embracing like oh we should be doing our

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
messaging we should be doing our

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
marketing

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,600
we should be creating materials for

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,399
newcomers and resources for newcomers

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,680
so that people who are not yet here have

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,000
a really clear sense

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
of what open source is why we do it why

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
we think it's important

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,279
and um we haven't done the greatest job

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
of that like

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,519
uh it's part of it's like a little bit

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
messy i think it's not always clear

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,240
where people are coming in

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,680
like we um i mean maybe one day we would

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
have a presence at every single

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,040
university where every single person

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,320
who first learns to code is showing up

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,199
um but you know it's one of the

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
great and then like kind of uh like

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,800
challenging things

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,680
about um learning to code is that you

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,480
can do it at home

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,720
anywhere so you might you might learn it

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,880
without learning some of the things that

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
uh would really help you out and i mean

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,480
that's true technically but it's also

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
true as far as like the

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,600
uh way that uh open source is and why

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
you can't mix certain code bases with

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,720
other code bases or why you have to

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,600
talk to your um you know the folks who

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
are you know doing the business piece of

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
your

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
organization before you incorporate a

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,680
giant code base

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,279
into the work that you're gonna sell to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,519
clients and customers

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,199
um you know and so like a lot of it's

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,120
like oh it didn't occur to me that i

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
would have to talk to someone in another

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
department

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,120
before i brought a giant code base from

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,120
outside into like our technical work

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
um i think that part's getting a little

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,919
bit better at least at larger

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,120
organizations although

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,600
i think it was maybe just a year ago

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,559
someone added me on twitter and said you

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,799
know like i

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
this copy left license i can't believe

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,799
that you all set up this honeypot

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
and i'm like it's it's like a

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,400
i don't know like a 20 year old license

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
it's not exactly like this

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
secret honey pot like there's a whole

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,360
website about it

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
um and i'm sorry that you incorporated a

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,640
bunch of code that you found out on the

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,679
internet without understanding

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,320
why that wasn't the way that didn't go

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,280
the way you thought it was gonna go go

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,160
so i'd like to like echoing what josh

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,200
said in his

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
previous conversation that obviously

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,600
points to a lot of opportunity for us

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,000
here at open source to do a better job

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,679
of making sure that when folks type in

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
like what is open source

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,320
like into like a search bar they get an

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
answer that is maybe not only just a

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,919
list of licenses

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,520
but uh talks a little bit about the

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
ethos and

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,799
the community and some of the places

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,400
that you might plug in

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
and some of the resources that you might

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,480
need to kind of get started

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
um you know between like a list of

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
licenses and

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
um you know whatever you are

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
encountering like at school as you learn

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,440
to code or at work as you

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,799
learn to be part of a business operation

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,120
so um so yeah some of those it's

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,840
like i guess like none of those are like

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
bad

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,480
challenges they're good challenges i

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,320
hope that we meet them with enthusiasm

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,440
and um and a little bit of humility

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,640
we're trying to uh kind of

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
channel our own earlier selves when we

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
didn't know

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
literally everything there is to know

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,720
and we didn't have opinions about every

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,039
single license out there

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,960
and you know that type of thing you know

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,480
you didn't have like a hierarchy of six

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
favorite programming languages and

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,160
things like that and try to

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
channel a little bit of that like what

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
was it like when i first got here and

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
didn't know

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
all the things there are to know because

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
we've been

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,960
now we've been doing this for a long

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,240
time so there's a lot of information out

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,760
there

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,520
and some of it is some of it's not

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,120
great um and so i think we want to

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
be kind of like singing with one voice

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,520
and making sure that we're

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,799
directing people to like good solid

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,000
sources of information

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,559
not stuff that seems like legal advice

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,039
from like a random person on a message

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,280
board that isn't a lawyer but like

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
stuff that's been vetted and looked at

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,080
uh by people who

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,200
know what they're doing um stuff that is

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,480
you know uh like reasonable

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,280
like actually kind of encapsulates like

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
the current

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
general thinking about like how you use

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,880
these licenses and like

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,360
how you set up an open source programs

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,679
office or how you do open source at work

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,720
um and so that you know we're all kind

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,159
of like

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,919
coalescing around a single uh body of

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
best practices for those things so

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
that's the challenge

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,640
that we have to meet and that's the way

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
that i think we have to meet it so i

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
hope that we're

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,840
we're excited to do that as a larger

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,240
community

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
um i don't know if we have other

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,880
questions

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,720
huh oh that's a good one too um

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,640
we've seen a lot of people experimenting

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,880
with licenses do you have any advice for

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
folks who aren't licensing experts

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
trying to make decisions about what

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,919
license they should choose

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,360
that's a really interesting one because

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,280
i feel like i've been answering that one

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,600
for 15 years

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,679
because there are a lot of licenses and

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,799
now there's even more just in the last

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,880
few years

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,760
um the the first place to start

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,880
on that conversation or that decision

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
tree would be

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
are you writing code for work because if

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,159
you're writing code

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,080
for work the first person you need to

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,960
speak to is your boss

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,280
like you cannot choose a license and put

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
stuff

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,159
out there without talking to your boss

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,760
unless you don't want that job anymore

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,520
but you do you if you want to keep that

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,000
job you should talk to your boss

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,679
uh the next thing you should do is if

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,559
you are building like a module

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,360
or an add-on or a library or you know

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
like another

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,679
piece of functionality on top of a giant

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,440
platform of other code

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,039
you should look at the license that that

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
other code is using so if you want to

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,000
put something

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,159
onto the linux kernel it should be

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,840
compatible with gpl v2

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
because the linux kernel is under the

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
general public license version too

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,679
so if you choose a license that's

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,360
incompatible with that license

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,200
then you can't add something to that

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,400
code base so like codebase is get

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,000
mixed and match pearl has its own

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,840
license so if you're writing pearl

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,679
modules you're probably going to use the

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
artistic license which most of the pearl

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,600
community does

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
and this is i'm kind of assuming that

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
you want people to use your code like if

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,720
you're doing open source and you're

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
thinking about open source licenses

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
then i'm kind of assuming that you want

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
people to use your code

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,600
if you're trying to i don't know like do

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
something

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,880
weird or troll people like that's a

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,919
different decision tree that i can't

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,039
help you with

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,679
um but so look at the the thing that you

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,000
are putting your code on top of so if

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,520
you're joining an existing community it

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
has to match

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,799
um if you're writing your own thing from

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,600
scratch

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,559
then i would say take a look at what do

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
you want to do

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,240
with that thing like what kind of

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
relationship do you want to have with

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,840
other contributors and users

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,520
and like are you monetizing the hard

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,000
like are you selling hardware

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,320
if you're selling hardware and your goal

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,440
is to get lots of home tinkerers

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,120
to write lots of cool code and programs

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
to work on the hardware you're selling

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,120
then you want to make it open

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
like choose at the very least a

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
permissive license

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
if you think that you might be in a

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
really interesting like

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,480
exciting patentable area you probably

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,600
want to choose a permissive license with

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
a patent clause

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,640
so that you don't get sued for patent

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,480
infringement um

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,080
and then if you want to make sure that

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,159
people share their changes back

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,600
and don't just like run off with them

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,159
then you want to choose a copyleft

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,400
license

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,440
so it depends a little bit on your use

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
space there

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,280
i love copylift i think it's great and

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
it helps you

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,039
have uh like it helps you create a

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
community where people

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,720
give back and they freely contribute on

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,480
each other's stuff

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,480
um you know and then but it's

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,640
because of the way that software as a

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
service works like sometimes copy left

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
doesn't

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,320
really work as copyleft because it's on

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
your own server

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,039
um i also worked on a project called

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
media goblin that used the agpl so we

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,159
were trying to create like a really

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,200
exciting um

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,080
platform for sharing media that was like

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,000
not

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
specific to a type of media so you could

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
put your speeches you could put your

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,159
songs you could put your movies your

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
music your

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,679
uh ascii art your photos whatever all in

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,080
one place like design around you

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,240
and then we've discovered there's like

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,320
all this stuff about like sharing on the

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,840
internet that's really there are some

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,440
like really hard problems that

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
when you're doing a smaller instance

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
that you need to solve so we wanted

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
people to like come

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
to media goblin and then add stuff and

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,960
then fuel

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
uh like they ought to return their

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
changes to the large body of

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,919
code in media goblins so we chose the

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,279
pharaoh general public license for that

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,480
i'm not a lawyer no one should take that

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,600
long conversation about theoreticals is

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
legal advice

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,919
but um yeah you really want to think

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
through like what kind of relationship

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
do you want to have with your

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
contributors

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,600
how important is it to make it really

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,880
easy for people to add code to your

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,840
code base and like

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,360
how important is the excitement around

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,120
whatever you're building

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,720
going to be for you to get the word out

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,200
so the more

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,159
um the more you want to have people like

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
contributing

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
and you know feeling invested in the

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
code base that you're building

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
um the more likely you're going to want

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,080
to pick like a good modern open source

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,039
license

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,840
so i hope that answers like anyone's

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
questions who are

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,840
thinking about like how to do that the

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,559
um

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,159
the experiments i think like those are

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,159
going to keep happening it's really

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,559
like i think for us at osi um

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,720
don't write your own license if you kind

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,400
of if you didn't do any of the thinking

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
that i just talked about and you kind of

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
painted yourself

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,000
into a corner where you forgot to talk

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
to the folks who were responsible for

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,279
business and sales

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
at your company before you chose a code

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,240
base and a platform to build on top of

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,159
like

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,400
don't come and then ask us to write a

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,960
carve out for open source for you

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,400
um or to rubber stamp a carve out for

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
open source for you

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,559
um take a look at the licenses that are

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,960
there that's not to say that we would

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
never

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
consider a new license there's

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,360
definitely like i said

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,799
i think the you know the uh dissolving

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
relationship between hardware and

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,919
software there's going to be some new

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
licenses that are going to come down the

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,640
pike there

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,320
that um we're going to look at and uh

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,919
i'm not saying we're gonna take all of

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,520
them um it has to be

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,200
written in a way that other people can

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,440
understand and use

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,799
and uh and feel like they they have a

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
reasonable expectation of what the

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
license does

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
um but we probably are gonna have to uh

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,960
approve a license like that at some

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,640
point so i hope

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,320
i hope a good one comes a little earlier

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,799
rather than later so we don't discourage

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
people

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
but um and there might be other places

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
like with the

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,679
experiments as far as like what people

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,279
are doing

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,039
um you know it's uh

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,440
data might be another place where we see

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,120
some new licenses coming in

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
um and you know that that might get a

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
little

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,240
that might get a little squishy too um

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,760
or might we might decide that belongs to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
like an open science foundation or

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,039
something instead

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,960
we'll see i mean what i'm saying is

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
don't be afraid to

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,520
consider the possibility of new licenses

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,960
if you've exhausted all the existing

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,799
licenses and nothing

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,200
meets your needs but you should

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,320
when i say exhaust i really you should

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,679
really exhaust

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,360
the list of existing licenses

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,480
um all right uh i don't know if

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,279
folks have more questions about uh what

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,960
we're up to what the osi is doing

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,000
um let's see

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
or more uh more things

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
i'd like to ask about like the affiliate

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,799
program or

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,880
the license review process or um

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,159
you know josh uh mentioned in the last

00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,600
talk but if you weren't there we are

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,760
going to be doing some hiring in the

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
next few months

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,600
specifically for an executive director

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,720
but also for like some folks to do

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,320
community management

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,279
and some communications work and so um

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
so that's uh it's really exciting for a

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,760
small

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,600
organization to go from one staff person

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,559
to like two or three or four

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,320
a huge growth huge opportunity to have a

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,799
lot of impact on

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,720
uh the way that the organization feels

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,159
and interacts with the community for the

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
next few years so

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
um i hope you'll keep an eye out for

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,760
that

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:44,799
uh let's see any other stuff that people

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:48,559
want to ask about

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,559
i don't know if folks are feeling shy

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,720
i'd just like to give you your 15 minute

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,679
warning

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,679
okay thank you cool

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,480
so um yep

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960
if um if people are quiet or they want

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,240
to

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,880
ask questions offline i'd be willing to

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,080
drop an email into the chat so that

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
people can

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,840
like if you have a question that you

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,520
didn't want to ask in public or in front

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,520
of the group that's also okay

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:32,240
so um any questions either about the

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,279
job openings that i mentioned or how to

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,480
get involved

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,159
or how to bring a project into our

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,320
affiliate program

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,279
or how to get involved with one of our

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,880
working groups

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,520
uh all of those queries can go to gm

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,880
opensource.org and i

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,120
read those and take a look at uh what's

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,840
going on there or folks have ideas

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,720
um but other things that they'd like to

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,320
see or they think that

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,760
you know they'd like to see on the

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,360
website the website is

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,200
probably due for a little bit of a

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,880
refresh

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
we'd be happy to hear from you about

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,120
that

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,480
so um yeah so josh says

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,480
what are the current job openings and

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
what are other openings uh that we

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,600
anticipate in the coming year

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
i'll drop in a link for the current

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,640
opening we are currently looking for

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,799
someone

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,679
who is able to help us with relationship

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,440
building

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,480
and uh fundraising and so

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,840
that one is a sustainability coordinator

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
um i'll type that in

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
and so that rule is it's it's 10 hours a

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,279
week

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,200
pays 30 an hour um it's

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,880
probably either someone who does this in

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
a couple of other places like as a

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,279
fundraising uh

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,520
professional or um someone who

of uh applicants would be very much

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,679
appreciated

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,360
uh some of the uh the next big thing

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,000
that's coming up we're probably we're

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
going to be hiring

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,760
for an executive director and we're also

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,840
looking for someone to do communications

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,679
so those are two big things the

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,080
executive director role is still in the

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,600
process of being

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,679
kind of tooled and described there are

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,120
a lot of if you have much experience

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,399
with nonprofits there are a lot of

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,399
different ways that

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,120
executive directors function at very

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,519
large organizations they just show up at

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,120
news conferences and galas we're not

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,200
probably looking for that kind of

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,480
executive director we're a pretty small

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,440
organization

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,880
um so the you know the person will not

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
be spending a lot of time

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
in makeup but be spending a little bit

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,080
more time um

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,440
doing work uh and so so it'll be it'll

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,640
be like a

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,279
like a high amount of hands-on um work

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,760
with a

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,480
with a small nonprofit organization so

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,679
that's

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,240
you know and when we have that post um i

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,320
hope that you'll all take a look uh

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,440
the communications or community

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,320
management role is

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,200
also not quite nailed down but um you

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
know will

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,240
encompass a lot of the traditional work

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,320
that happens

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,279
in those kinds of roles so like helping

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,279
us um

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,279
do more outreach helping us make sure

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,559
that we're creating great content

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,039
and convening great conversations with

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,240
people around open source and

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,919
the tools and resources that people

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,519
have been asking for or would like to

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,960
provide or the conversations they would

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,399
like to have with each other and sort of

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
sussing out what that is

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,600
so it'll be like a fairly traditional

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,480
like

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,360
community management like communications

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
type of role

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,240
