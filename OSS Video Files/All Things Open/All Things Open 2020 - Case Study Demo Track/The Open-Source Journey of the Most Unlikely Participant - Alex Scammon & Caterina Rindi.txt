	Presented by: Alex Scammon & Caterina Rindi, G-Research
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: How does an insular and secretive fintech company move from primarily Closed-Source tech to Open-Source tools? We'll discuss the technology, the culture, and the security changes needed to make the leap. We'll also talk about how this moved G-Research to embrace, support, and engage the Open-Source community, including the pitfalls, resistance, magic, and breakthroughs.

hello everyone um i'll be watching the

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
questions in the q a

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,719
so uh ideally actually if you put them

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
there that would be the best spot for us

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,640
uh welcome very cool if you were on the

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760
last one to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,000
see terence's nsa presentation

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,400
but i want to welcome you to ours this

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,960
is the open source journey of the most

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
unlikely participant in the history of

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
history

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,120
itself um we are

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,120
katarina rindy the um community

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
head director of community uh open

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
source community

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,239
at g research and uh and i'm alex gammon

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
head of the open source department at g

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
research

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
and what is g research g research is a

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
quantitative

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
finance research film a firm based in

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
london

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,079
and we use machine learning big data and

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
other tools to predict

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,359
movements in financial markets so do

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,000
research tackles big questions

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
and as you can imagine we are very

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,799
serious about security

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,600
and competition in this field

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
yeah and so along those lines part of

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
the

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,040
uh as kevin mentioned we're really

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
focused on security here so

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
if you come to our offices it looks

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,640
something like this

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,400
uh archers are stationed at all those

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
points along the battlements if you try

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
and get in

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,799
you'll be shot at you'll also have to

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
get across the

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
moats of lava uh it's very very serious

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,240
here

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,560
on an actual real note

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,320
we famously if you walk through our

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,320
metal detectors and you have a bit too

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,040
much metal in your shoes

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,759
people will give you slippers for the

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,960
rest of the day until you go home

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,600
so it really is very very heavily

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
security minded at this place

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
and uh just to give you a little more

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
background

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
just to sort of set up the the notion

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
that this is a really

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
difficult place to be doing open source

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
work from um

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
here's just a little breakdown of what

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,040
katarina and i have to face to

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,040
just deal with email there are about

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
three email addresses plus our personal

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
address

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
there's an internal only email address

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
there's an internal

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,920
external email address and then there's

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480
an external email address for talking

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
with other

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,400
outside people but to compound the

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
problem

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,080
you can't actually get to all of the

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,599
email addresses on any one device that

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
we have

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
this is sort of a rough breakdown of

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
what we have to go through to

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
actually get to certain emails and these

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,840
email addresses don't really

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
talk to one another it's all kind of

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,040
complicated so

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,840
just just take it from us if this is

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
our email address situation you can only

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
imagine how hard it is to

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
actually deal with getting code from

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
inside your research to

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
outside we have a very complicated

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,760
system of levers and pulleys

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
more complicated and complex than i've

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
ever had to deal with at any company

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
before

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
so this is we have many more examples

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,159
but this is a brief conversation

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
so take it from us this is really hard

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
to do

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,440
yet uh we're still doing open source

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
we run this team and so let's take you

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,720
through

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,720
how we got there

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
so understanding how g research got to

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
that point

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
in 2001 big data wasn't really a thing

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,080
yet

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
that's when g research was founded

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,480
in 2004 google's mapreduce paper this

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
was a seminal moment describing how to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,599
process

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,680
big chunks of information 2005 hadoop

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
was founded and the term big data was

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,720
coined

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
and since then everything has exploded

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,519
in

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,159
that world so g research was building

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
everything

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
in-house prior and the technology the

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
open source

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
work was really passing us by

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:20,560
and in reality uh even though g research

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,919
started as a very insular and in-house

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,000
engineering universe by

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
2018 when we started this open source

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
team

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
the reality was that open source

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,400
software

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,720
was just in every facet of

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
g research from programming languages to

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
operating systems

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
you know all sorts of flavors of linux

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
we have

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
any number of monitoring systems that

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
are all the

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
open source uh options that you would

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
expect orchestration

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
layers we've got chef we've got ansible

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,120
you know

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
everything that you would expect from a

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
normal

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,720
technical company in 2018

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,240
2020 we're using those tools and they're

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
all open source

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,960
and specific data science tools

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
that we rely upon are more and more open

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
source

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
um so given this

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
backdrop we realized that we had to

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
change we had to move from being a

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,400
bespoke artisanal in-house

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
engineering team to actually engage open

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
source software

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
and we obviously ran across the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
technical challenges of

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
disconnected devs you know we we'd fork

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
some of the software to try and solve

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,160
problems internally and then of course

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,120
the rest of the the folks working in

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
that project

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,560
would pass us by so that ended up

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,680
wasting a lot of time on maintenance and

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
code but

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
we realized that there were other

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,160
benefits as well there were financial

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,199
benefits

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
along the way we've

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,919
gained almost or we've recovered almost

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
uh saved

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,560
1.07 million dollars

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,400
in and financial savings

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
we've been able to focus much more on

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,639
our core business by using

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,000
open source and we've been able to hire

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
folks we've become a little more

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
transparent

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,440
um still maintaining our security and

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
hire folks that want to work in open

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,400
source or

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
our internal software developers that

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
want to contribute to open source

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
um we've been able to to set that up for

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
them so these were

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
some things that came up along the way

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,880
thank you you can go ahead

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,479
for the next one um

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
i just want to talk a little bit about

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
how we were actually able to

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,840
to move this company from being the

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,680
insular

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,080
back water that it was um and

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
very fortunately we had leadership that

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
uh that

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
understood this and came to this

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
realization uh along with the sort of

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
grassroots efforts of the

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
engineers um which doesn't happen at

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,599
every company

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,720
i know that some of us have to fight

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,039
to get our leadership to understand what

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
open source could mean for our companies

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,240
we we had that um and

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,440
the the next step for us was to put this

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
team together

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
and actually put our money where i'm

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
where our mouth is and

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,440
and hire people dedicate people to

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,800
this cause but not just

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,520
to contribute code we decided to embrace

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,080
all facets of open source there's

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
there's more

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
to just doing open source than

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
contributing code there's a whole

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
community

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,199
and uh multiple many multiples of

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
communities that we have to

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,199
uh foster and help so whether that's

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,960
running meetups hosting meetups

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,160
writing blog posts writing articles

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,400
there are a number of different ways

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,080
that we have our team engaging in

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,199
the open source world

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,919
and the last piece of how

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,759
we've worked to make this happen is

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,919
internal to g research

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,879
there were still a lot of people who

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,879
were very very security minded and

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,919
really it's it was a process to win over

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,960
the skeptics within g research to to

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,639
make it clear that open source software

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,879
had a place at g research and that we

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,240
were going to get amazing value from

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,560
contributing and benefiting from it um

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,360
and

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
we could do so without actually uh

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
damaging our security

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,360
so those are the those are the main

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,959
steps

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
and we mentioned some of the challenges

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,240
that we had there were other practical

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,919
considerations that we hadn't quite

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
anticipated but that

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,800
came up and we've been able to work with

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
our legal teams for example

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,760
um teaching them what open source is

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,519
we led a training on that and

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,519
helping them figure out and helping us

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
figure out which open source licenses

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
now

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
our internal software developers can use

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,720
and

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
when we are maintaining projects or if

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
we

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
are taking over projects which open

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,160
source licenses

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
are still um jiving with jr and legal

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
we also worked with marketing team and

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
the recruiting team as i mentioned

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,920
the savings and finance and we worked

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
with our internal corporate social

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,519
responsibility

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
team because we have been giving a lot

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
to

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
back to the open source ecosystem so

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
there's larger

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,240
benefits um that we also hadn't

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
necessarily anticipated but that have

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
been great and have

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,680
along the way and so

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,040
what are we actually up to now there's a

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
lot of

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
uh contributions technical contributions

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
that we're making directly

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,279
uh we've also in a certain few cases

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
offered to take over maintainership of

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
some projects projects that we were

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
using that we could see other community

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,600
members using

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,760
but had lost their uh the attention of

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,760
the maintainers for whatever reason

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,320
um and then in a certain few cases

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
we've moved to fill gaps in the open

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
source

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
universe by actually creating projects

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
and

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,600
making them open source this i will say

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,519
though

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,160
is a form of last resort for us we

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,399
prefer to engage with existing

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,279
communities and existing projects and

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,360
make them better before just depositing

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,440
a bunch of code on the open source world

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:38,160
that's just our particular philosophy we

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,079
try and uphold that um and so

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,839
that there are just you know there is

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,839
not a huge team there's about 10 maybe

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
12 members on our team

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
but over the last year we've contributed

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,040
to over 140

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,399
uh open source projects which is i think

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,720
rather remarkable and great uh that

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,560
it doesn't take that many people to make

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,440
a meaningful contribution in the world

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
that's by and large what we're up to um

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
here's

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
oh here's a list if you want to go

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
through

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
yeah just a few of the projects that we

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
have worked on some of them are big

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,240
names openstack

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,959
kubernetes some of them are smaller some

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,519
of them are projects that we've

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,959
taken over and are maintaining and if

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
you have any specific questions about

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
some of the tech that we're using there

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
put those in the q a and alex can help

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
answer answer those

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,000
and really the whole point of this talk

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
is just to communicate what we believe

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
and

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
and hopefully inspire you we really do

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,880
believe that open is the future

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,079
and this is us the most

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,120
isolated company in the universe

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,440
before two years ago and so

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
the takeaway is like if we can do it

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,839
with our four

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,279
email addresses and our slippers and our

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,200
uh moats of oil

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,160
burning and all that kind of stuff uh

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,360
we believe that you probably can too and

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,279
uh and we really believe that everyone

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,600
needs to engage in this so

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:14,320
that's that's our main takeaway for this

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,480
so as since we're here we'll just put in

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
