Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: New Relic is committed to open standards, open instrumentation, and open collaboration, and, as part of that, we are making a hard shift to be a much more open organization. The code prep for open sourcing and change of focus to open technologies and standards is major, but so is the company culture change. This presentation will detail what changes we have made, both code (e.g. single-source development, GitHub for issue lifecycle, etc.) and culture (e.g. customer support in the open, open source marketing, etc.), to support opening up and provide resources to other organizations that would like to do the same.
