Title: How New Relic Went Open Source: Code & Culture - Gavin Johnson
Publication date: 2020-12-14
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Case Study Demo Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Gavin Johnson, New Relic
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: New Relic is committed to open standards, open instrumentation, and open collaboration, and, as part of that, we are making a hard shift to be a much more open organization. The code prep for open sourcing and change of focus to open technologies and standards is major, but so is the company culture change. This presentation will detail what changes we have made, both code (e.g. single-source development, GitHub for issue lifecycle, etc.) and culture (e.g. customer support in the open, open source marketing, etc.), to support opening up and provide resources to other organizations that would like to do the same.

hi

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,679
everybody um i'm gavin i'm from new

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
relic and today we want to talk about

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,360
um how we went open source with our our

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,040
instrumentation which was kind of a

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
pretty big thing for us like a pretty

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
big lift for us to do

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
and we wanted to talk about it and kind

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,800
of share our experience and hopefully be

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,600
helpful to somebody else and frankly i

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,680
think it's just kind of interesting

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,199
story anyway

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
so i have to put this up because we

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,359
always have to put this up just the safe

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,039
harbor

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
basically nothing i'm saying here

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
indicates anything or tells you anything

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
about future performance don't invest

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,559
based off the stuff that i'm saying here

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,600
today

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
it's more or less what this says

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,040
bullying is up here just for a second

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
so you guys can take a look at it real

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
quick

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
okay let's move along so

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
um i want to start by introducing myself

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
i'm gavin johnson

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
i'm the product marketer new relic for

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
all things open source that we do

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
prior to new relic i was a product

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,000
marketer att

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
working on their video products um

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,960
notably at t

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,640
tv the little box that you can get

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
streaming video on in your house

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,360
i was a product marketer on that as well

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
as the relaunch of directv now

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,200
a little bit on the directv like digital

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
applications and some of their att uvers

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,479
tv stuff as well so

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,759
really a lot of att video products

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
before new relic

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,680
uh and then before att i was at deloitte

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
i was a tech consultant as a manager

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
over there

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,759
so i managed big tech projects um the

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
one that i did

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,840
the most or spent the most time doing i

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,759
spent about two years at fox studios

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
uh you know the the studio was bought by

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,479
disney um

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
helping them build their theatrical

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
release planning system

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
uh and then before that i was in

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,799
business school at university of

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
southern california and before that i

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
was a

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,920
assist admin before that i was a dev and

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,840
to start my career off i got a bs in

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,240
computer science from oregon state

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
so x-dev turned into a marketer and i do

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
product marketing for tech companies now

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,439
so this whole talks about how new relic

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
open source transportation

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,960
the code and the culture of it what went

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,439
into it so to give you context around

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
that

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,319
i kind of want to describe what our

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
instrumentation is to give you an idea

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,879
of like the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
the amount of software that we were open

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,959
sourcing uh so

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
really when you think about new relics

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
product

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
there's kind of three layers to it um

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
and there's this this isn't necessarily

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
lined out the way we build or anything

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
like that

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
there's three layers of way that

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
software works uh one's the

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
instrumentation so

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
for us it's our agents and our

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,200
integrations it's how you send data from

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
your applications or your infrastructure

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,239
into new relic so that's that's one

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
piece

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
the second piece is the data platform

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
where that data actually goes

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,640
where it gets stored where you can

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
operate on it uh and then the third

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
piece

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
is analysis and visualization and you

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
could say there's a fourth piece around

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
applied intelligence too

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
um and i think that will grow more and

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,239
more like apparent as things go on but

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
really there's kind of three layers

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
right now

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
so what we're talking about is the

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
instrumentation layer

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
that is about a third of the software

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,920
that we had

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
um and what we did here is on april 30th

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
of this year bill staples our chief

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
product officer

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
announced internally that we are going

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,920
to be open sourcing all of that

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
instrumentation

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,599
um all of it you know we had spent

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
hundreds and thousands of hours building

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,200
this instrumentation out

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
building out our agents our integrations

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
our sdks

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
um our cli and we were going to open

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
source all of it and we were going to do

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
it to align with

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,599
a big launch that we had three months

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
later so we had three months to open

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,440
source about a third

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
of the software that we write so that's

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
a pretty steep ass

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
that's how we got that was the step of

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
the story so that's what we're gonna do

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,360
i'm gonna walk you through how we did it

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,599
but before that i kinda wanna talk about

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
why we we decided to do this

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
because the why is extremely important

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
too um you know you don't just decide to

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,680
open source your software usually

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
doesn't just come out of nowhere

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
so again the reasoning behind this is

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
relatively simple

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
um our instrumentation team the team

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
that builds all of our instrumentation

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,959
our agents our integrations

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,720
um their goal their mission statement is

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
to enable every engineer in the world to

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
gather complete telemetry about their

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,159
digital systems

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
uh when you look at open telemetry which

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,799
is one of these key

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,000
cncf projects right now uh it

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,160
shares basically the same goal uh

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
and you know we we've noticed we noticed

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
that like we've been a contributor to

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
we've been continuing to open telemetry

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
for over a year

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
now we're the number three contributor

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
in the last quarter number six in the

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
last year

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
like we're heavily involved in already

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,440
uh and we can see that that's where

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
instrumentation is going it's going to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
be based off of open telemetry code open

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
telemetry standards

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
um and we're going to align with that

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,240
and that was a decision we made that we

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
that we felt we needed to make to really

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
get towards and make our mission more

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
likely to be successful to enable every

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
engineer to gather complete telemetry

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
about their digital systems

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
we need to be making our instrumentation

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
in the same way

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
that the most popular standards are so

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
we're going to be making

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
our future instrumentation downstream

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
from the openslim tree project and the

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
prometheus project

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
so we're still developing and supporting

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,400
our current agents but as these cncf

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
standards mature

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,160
they become more generally available

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
more and more of our instrumentation

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
will implement

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,759
the open telemetry and prometheus

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
standards and be built downstream from

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,880
those projects

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,639
so that was this choice that we made a

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
strategic choice that we we need to do

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,680
as a company

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,360
and part of that because these projects

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,560
are open source projects open telemetry

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
and prometheus

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
is that we can't work in the closed

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
while we're working on these open source

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
projects like we have to be working open

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
source

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,720
um so that's why we're making our agent

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
sources that's why we decided to make

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
them open source

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
and you know this wasn't the the first

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
time that we had done this really like

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,720
we had done some of this before

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
our elixir agent and our roku agent were

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
both launched as open source

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
projects um and we've had stuff that's

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,320
been code available forever

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,319
so like even our node.js agent which is

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,840
pretty popular and our ruby agent which

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
is very popular they've both been code

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
available

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,000
um it is under an open source license uh

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,280
and also like just looking back like as

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
far back as 2012

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
probably further we've been open

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
sourcing parts of our instrumentation

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,800
software maybe not our agents directly

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
but other pieces that help enable them

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
and we've been contributing open

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,120
telemetry for over a year so open source

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
wasn't a new thing this wasn't new to us

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
but it wasn't something that every

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
engineer was doing

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
it was a major change for a vast

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
majority of our instrumentation teams

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
engineers

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
you know they weren't working on open

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
source projects they weren't working

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
with opencylindria prometheus

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
um they're working on private

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,800
proprietary software but private

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,000
proprietary tooling for the most part

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,000
so just thinking about that like

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
the way that you build your code in a

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,960
private proprietary environment is very

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
different the way you build an open

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
source environment

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
the way that you maybe comment and

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,639
document your code is different maybe

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
even the way that you just write your

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
code frankly

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
is different when it has that public

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,160
view and that public scrutiny as opposed

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,840
to being private

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
so there are a lot of changes just in

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
that approach alone and just the way

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,280
that our engineers needed to

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,960
write their code but in addition to that

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
like we also know that

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,479
for this to actually work for us to

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
actually get any any lift off of this

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
like we need to be a little bit more

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,520
community or in a community friendly

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,440
and we need to be more of an open source

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
partner instead of being just a company

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,599
that drops open source code

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
um on the on the people that may or may

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
not use it

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
you know and to be that partner to

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,360
really work with these projects well to

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
integrate with them well

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
we needed to transform the way that we

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
created maintained all of our

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
instrumentation

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,000
i mean just straight down to it we

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
couldn't keep doing the same things and

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,960
hope for different results

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
so we needed to change the way we were

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
doing things to align with what we were

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
going to do

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
and that is the reason that july 30th

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
date was set they decided this couldn't

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
be a quick thing and it's going to be a

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
slow thing it's going to be a thing that

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
takes months or years

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,160
needed to happen quick there also is

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
going to be painful to make this

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
transition from

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,080
private and proprietary to open source

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,599
um and that's one of the big reasons

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,759
that three month deadline set

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,639
detroit light a fire under this team

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
right and

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,599
in that three-month deadline really the

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
work that was going to be done was open

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
sourcing all of our most popular

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
proprietary agents integrations and sdks

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
so this wouldn't be all of them because

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
some of them really aren't in a in a

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,759
state to be

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,039
to be open source they need some work to

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,479
get there they use a lot of third-party

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,599
libraries and stuff like that that would

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
need to be rebuilt

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,759
but our most popular ones especially apm

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
and infrastructure agents could all be

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
all be ready in this timeline so that

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
was the goal to open source

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,320
all of the most popular agents

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
integrations and our sdks

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,959
and the reason that we set that july

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
30th date was because we were completely

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,240
shifting the way the new relic was was

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
packaged and sold

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
um we were making it more friendly i

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
think went from like 12 skus or

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
something like that down to three

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
just making it simpler and easier to

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
understand and really putting the

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
the way that you spend your money the

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,080
way you pay for new relic where the

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
value you get out of it is

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
um so that that was the the big reason

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,519
for pushing it towards the state not

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,040
only did it align well

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,399
with that date and you know having a big

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,240
announcement and getting you know some

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
notice behind it but even beyond that it

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
was complementary to this um

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,839
now you can really just buy our

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
telemetry data platform straight and

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
just

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
ingest data into it and use the open

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,519
source tools to set it in

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
so us open sourcing our agents aligned

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,480
really well with that change

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,839
and we wanted to make sure that it

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360
launched with that change so it wasn't

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,600
like a big hangover afterwards

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
they're like cool i can ingest into your

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
data platform but

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,920
i don't really have anything open source

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
to do it with it it's a little tricky i

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
still have to use your old agents

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
like it's we just wanted to make it

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
simple we want to line that store yet

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,360
so that date was set uh and that's what

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
we pushed towards

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,920
so this is awesome right this is great

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,640
there's a ton of amazing work

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,880
that anybody can use or build on now and

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
it's available you can go to

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
opensource.newrelic.com and see all of

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
our instrumentation that we've open

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
sourced it's a ton

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
right and that's determined right we

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
can't wait on this the longer we wait

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,040
the greater the pain is going to be

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,079
and this matters to our business so we

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
need to do it now we can't waste time

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,519
and that seems you know a little

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
inspiring right like the the the right

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
thing to do for business now

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,760
for a lot of businesses for a lot of

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
these tech companies is to open source

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
parts of their products

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
to open source parts of their software

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
like that is where their competitive

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,880
advantage lies is having the access to

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
it

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
having people to people be able to build

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
with it and build off of it

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,399
it's inspiring right we're a big company

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,440
we're pushing people to do this

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,680
that's awesome but that's not

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,279
easy it's hard this is difficult to do

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
like you don't do something like this

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,839
overnight like there's an enormous

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,279
enormous amount of code preparation uh

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,320
that goes into this and it kind of

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,920
breaks down

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
um into a ton of tasks but you can

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519
loosely group it into like three

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
and one was making sure that we weren't

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,880
using any third-party non-open source

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
libraries

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,839
so you know we can't open source code

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,800
that uses other code that isn't open

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,920
source it doesn't work with the

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
licensing models

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
so we had to go through and do that and

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,279
part of that was do using like code

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
scanners

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
um but other parts that was actually

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
going through and like having to rewrite

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
libraries or pieces of software that

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
were third party that we couldn't use

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
in open source agent we also had to

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,839
update as much

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
as reasonable of our commenting and

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,040
documentation um

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
because standards vary over time and we

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,000
want it to be standardized and easy for

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
people to use and understand how they

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
would need to

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
document and comment if they built on

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,399
top of our platform or with our platform

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,680
uh and then lastly is just code cleanup

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
right a lot and making sure that your

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,839
code's

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,279
not messy making sure it runs well

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,640
making sure it's like built in a way

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
that makes sense for an open source

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
project

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,560
um really just getting it ready for the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,320
world to use

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,399
and the instrumentation team took all of

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
this on with this aggressive timeline

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
which wasn't an impossible ask but it's

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
it's a difficult one that's a lot

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
of work for a three month time one but

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,200
they took that on

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,639
but even more than that um

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
a lot of us here especially a lot of

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,200
leadership here understands that

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,519
making this leap from closed proprietary

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
culture to an open culture can can be

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,000
make or break for business

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,200
right um if you don't do it well it's

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
kind of the difference between you being

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,000
innovative or becoming irrelevant

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
um if you go open source and or a bad

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,040
open source company then you're not

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,399
really an open source company right so

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
to really get any of the benefits that

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,360
we expected have out of it to get some

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
community engagement

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
to get people working with and better

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,920
using

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
our instrumentation by open sourcing it

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,600
we'd have to

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,120
adopt an open culture as well um and

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
there's a lot to that

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
you know we have to change the way that

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
we handle issues and feature requests

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
uh we have to change the way we deal

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
with customer escalations we have to

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
change

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
the security within and around our

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,399
products um

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,000
we've changed engineer work tracking

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
frankly right just the way engineers do

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
their code

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
or attract their work with change the

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,519
development process itself because the

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
way you develop an open source is

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,360
different than in a closed

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,959
proprietary environment and frankly we

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,720
have changed the hiring profile

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,160
right everything about the way we built

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,639
maintained and supported our

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,360
instrumentation had to change

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
so uh the leadership and the

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,079
instrumentation team

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,560
put together a project team um of people

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
that were purposely selected to help do

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,519
this well

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
uh and they called this team the open by

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,519
default team by default project

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
uh and the leaders of this project were

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,920
char creden she's a director

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
in our software engineering group she's

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
uh

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
basically the director of our

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
instrumentation team she's responsible

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,079
for all the instrumentation engineering

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
teams

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,880
making sure they operate well make sure

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,680
they produce what they need to produce

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
next was melissa klein she is our open

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
source

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
program manager i'm from our open source

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,160
program office uh we have one of those

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,360
and melissa has a ton of open source

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
experience she was the open source

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
program manager ibm for 15 years prior

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
to new relic

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
and then lastly was ben evans and if you

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
have heard of ben before it's probably

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,880
because he's he's one of like the

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,000
japa people he's been involved

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
in open source projects frequently in

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
leadership positions for about

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,040
20 years if not longer he's been

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
involved in

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,079
creating java standards for many many

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,079
years

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
he is literally the author of the java

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,040
book dropping a nutshell from o'reilly

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,360
like he's he's the

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,680
java guy and he works for new relic and

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,160
and we knew that his experience

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
would help us go open source and adopt

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,000
nova culture better

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,360
and that's how the open by default

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
project started with these three

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
in the open by default project they

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,519
developed four guiding principles that

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
they want our engineers to

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
to really focus on and work with and the

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
first one is open by default

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,639
and this is very simply any new software

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,880
that the instrumentation team builds

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
will be open source by default the

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
amount of work that the teams do in

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,360
non-open source repositories

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,199
will over time decrease to a minimum and

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
just doing this requires a major shift

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,959
in thinking goes beyond code

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,959
includes transitioning into workflows

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,279
where things like project governance

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
or design decisions take place in the

00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,519
open instead behind closed doors like

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
they did

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,120
currently the second thing is go where

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,040
the engineers are

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,639
so unless there is genuinely no existing

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,360
community to fit the purpose

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,800
a new relic will contribute to or new

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
relic won't build a community

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
uh and frankly simply what we're saying

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
there is you know

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,199
if there is already a project out there

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
doing what we're trying to do

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,240
or doing working towards the goal that

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,760
we're working towards

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,199
we're not going to fire up a new project

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
and try to get people to come and work

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
on ours

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
if there's a community where people

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
communicate around the projects that

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
work on we're going to go there we're

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,880
going to go work on their projects we're

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
not going to bring them into us if we

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,040
don't have to

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,399
we're only going to bring people in as a

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,600
last resort if there's absolutely

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,639
nothing available that fits the need

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,959
the third is do the work so

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,800
you know while we expected that a lot of

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,959
and still do expect that a lot of

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,320
a lot of our contributions will come in

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,120
in leadership areas in some of these

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
projects

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,639
um we wanted to not emphasize that or

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,000
focus in on like trying to be

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,920
leaders of these project leadership

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
positions really just showing up and

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,440
doing the work

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,800
we know that a lot of the work that

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
needs to be done in projects like open

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
telemetry isn't

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
leadership it's just writing the code

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,279
it's doing doing the work that needs to

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,720
be done

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
and we'll show up and we're going to do

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
the work and that's that's one of the

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
the guiding principles behind what we're

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,040
doing

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,720
and we're going to be seen doing it and

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,560
like our belief is that those leadership

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,279
positions will follow as

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,240
as suited um based off of the work that

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,920
we do so

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,160
we're about doing the work not about

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,240
trying to drive the boat all the time

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
and then lastly our contributions are

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
visible so not only are they visible in

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,880
projects that we work on

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,240
but we needed to as an organization um

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
in the engineering team and frankly

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
outside the engineering team talk more

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,959
about what we do with open source and

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
open standards projects

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
we need people from our engineering team

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
to be willing to you know do more talks

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,560
at conferences like this one

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,600
which is why you saw michael wang a few

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
minutes ago

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
do a chat on ruby and changing over to

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
github actions which is one of the major

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
things

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,000
this instrumentation team did um in this

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
project you know that getting people

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
going out there and talking more about

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,839
what we do make sure that we write more

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
stories about what we do

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,679
um in open source and make sure that

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,240
it's it's clearly known to our customers

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,240
that

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,559
you can find open source a new relic

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,319
like if you want good open source

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,799
monitoring software and instrumentation

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,199
you can come to new relic for that

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
so those are the four guiding principles

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,679
that the team had

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,360
and they produced one

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
big guidebook i guess to get away but

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,720
it's not a big guy but they produce one

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,480
really key piece of content i'll call it

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,600
um for our instrumentation team and

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
frankly for a lot of our other

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
supporting teams around

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
the instrumentation team and this was

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,760
called the open by default

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
transformation guidebook

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,919
it was simple it's nothing complicated

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,440
it was it was a google doc basically

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
with link offs to a bunch of other

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
policy documents that this team had

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
built and was collaborating on across

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,240
the instrumentation team

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
uh and those documents are the ones

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,760
listed on the screen

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,440
um it's basically just a library it was

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,360
a one-stop shop to go to

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
like figure out if i need to comment on

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
something if i want to give feedback on

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
a process that's going to be put in

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
place

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,080
or if i need to know the process so i

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
can start implementing it this is where

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
i go

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,559
and the primary function of it is to

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,000
communicate information efficient

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
efficiently and provide

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,120
you know mechanisms for collaboration

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
and feedback that that's really all this

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,080
was for

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
but it did a lot of things really well

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
and the things that did really well was

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
it made it very clear what we were

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
changing

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
and what people needed to change by

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
going off and look at the specific

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,840
details and conversation

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,200
had within the team around that so the

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,559
areas that the open by default

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
transformation guidebook

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,600
addressed are issue life cycle

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,760
management um

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,679
historically we defined our issue life

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
cycle process on per team basis more or

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
less

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,240
so different agent teams had different

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
slightly different processes for issue

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
lifecycle

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
the open by default project decided to

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,000
standardize these across teams

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,919
um and the big notable change here in

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
michael and his presentation references

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
as well

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
is that there was a change over to

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,320
github so we changed our

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
issue tracking system over to github

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,440
issues we previously were in a

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,880
private jira so we we moved over to gab

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
issues to make it easier for

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,240
people working in the open source

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,520
community people working around our

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,720
projects that want to contribute to our

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,720
projects make it easier for them

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
we also just adopted a lot of other

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
github processes

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
as well like michael talked about we

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
adopted github actions for our ci cd

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,200
um but we didn't write process and

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,559
policy around a lot of them outside of

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,760
github issues and you have projects

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,320
we'll go into that a little bit later

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
too

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,240
so we moved our issue lifecycle

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,600
management over to github

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,559
um our feature request process

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,320
also moved over to github so the

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
existing feature request process had

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
three entry points

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,799
through our product roadmap software

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
through account teams and

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,960
through uh our support channels uh the

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
by default team decided that we didn't

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,080
really want to get rid of any of those

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
because those teams were used to them

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,520
they already worked in them it was

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,240
mainly changed the the endpoint

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,679
so for account teams and our support

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
channels um

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,080
instead of jira going into github issues

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,760
and filing the feature request there

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,360
for customers in our product roadmap

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,559
software directly um

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,320
for them they can still enter in the

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,760
procro map software we implement an

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
integration between the two that syncs

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
them across

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,919
and all of the issues are managing

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,280
github issues in the public but some do

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,320
come down from our product

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,679
roadmap software into github issues and

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,679
then our sync back when appropriate

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
public road maps this is the the other

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,799
piece of moving to github that we had to

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,799
put some policy around

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,720
so currently like i mentioned we had you

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,240
know a product roadmap software that our

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
customers could access to see

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,520
where things stood and when things were

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,480
coming from our products we decided that

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,919
because we were moving

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,919
our issues and our feature requests and

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
our ci cd and basically all of our

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,559
repositories that weren't there already

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
although i think almost all them were to

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
github

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,799
they would make sense to move to github

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,240
public road maps as well uh and to do

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,480
that we had that or we were gonna

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,919
make it have projects um just frankly in

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,640
the time frame that we were working with

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,120
we couldn't move to get out projects

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
during uh or for this launch we had to

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
we're still working on that right now

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
um but we instead we decided to

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,840
splitting to kind of two phases so the

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,919
early phase

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,080
we put a roadmap markdown file at the

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,840
top level of of all of our repos

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,840
that would include a roadmap and then in

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
the future we'd move to github projects

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,960
and start tracking our projects with a

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,960
regular roadmap via github

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
for security this one's this one's

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
actually um kind of interesting too

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
because

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,320
what one of the one of the issues with

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,600
moving to github issues one of the

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
problems i say won't to really help a

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
problem one of the uh

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,799
one of the issues with moving to github

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,600
issues let's stick with that

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,240
is that any security issue anything with

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,320
embargo level or highly sensitive

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,520
material or data in it can still come in

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,679
through github issues

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,720
in a open way that was not available

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,960
previously so this

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
opened us up for people to possibly get

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
exposure to

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,080
security issues that we don't want them

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,000
to have access to or know about um

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,159
and the open by default team that just

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
decided that you know for these security

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,360
issues

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,760
uh unless they had embargo level

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,200
uh security issues like a customer could

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,559
sue us or something like that

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
or a partner could sue us frankly

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,039
basically if it couldn't get us in

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,240
trouble legally

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,240
that we would leave them in github

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,000
issues we'd leave them uh open we'd

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,760
leave them searchable after they were

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,080
after they were resolved so people could

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
go back and look at them um

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
and that that was just a decision that

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,799
we made anything that we do need to pull

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,480
back that is embargo level we will

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,840
revert back to you we have a private

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
jira a very small one

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
for this right now that we'll be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,120
reverting back to using in those

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,360
instances

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,799
but in general the idea is you know

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,000
we're working in github issues our

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,520
security issues will come in through

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
github issues too and they will stay

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,320
publicly visible so people can go back

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,320
and reference them if necessary

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
customer escalations also had to be

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,880
changed

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,640
a little bit as well uh because we you

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,159
know aren't an open source project right

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
off the bat we are a

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
company that you know sells ingestion

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,480
seats uh

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
and customers pay for customer support

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,039
um

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,120
we have to have a way to integrate

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,000
customer escalations into an open source

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
process

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
uh so the way that we decided to do that

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
was to keep you know all of the

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
uh all of the process in place for the

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,039
most part

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,799
but adapt it to the new channels

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,600
primarily get out and get up issues

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
um so we created templates for issues

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,679
and feature requests basically make it

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,919
easy

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
for a customer to come in and make an

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,039
issue or a feature request

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,720
make it easy for our global technical

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,159
support team to do that for customers as

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,760
well or for an account team to do that

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,240
for customers

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,919
and we also provided templates for

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,440
common replies and routing

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,200
for the engineers that need to triage

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,480
these issues basically we tried to make

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
it so that our customer escalations

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
could be more direct

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679
inside of github and also be addressed

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
more directly by our engineers without

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,279
having to do a bunch of toil on a bunch

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
of work

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
engineering work tracking was pretty

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,640
straightforward um

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,000
because the instrumentation these

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
engineers are going to work on

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,679
working on would be open source and be

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,559
working with github

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,120
and github issues and the open telemetry

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,520
project

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
also works with github issues the best

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
way for us to actually track engineers

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
work across these projects

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,919
is to to more or less just use github

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,279
issues as well so

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,320
we shift our engineering work tracking

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,240
over to github issues too

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
we also had to adapt some of our

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
management practices

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
um notably the career ladder and

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,679
performance analysis to better align

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
with

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,799
uh the the new work process and open

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
source the engineers we're going to be

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,039
doing

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,960
as well as you know building in some

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,320
some timeline expectations

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
to better align with the open source

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,600
workflow uh because

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
especially when you're looking at some

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
of the projects they're working on

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
outside of

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,480
our own like open telemetry we don't

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,960
always get to decide timelines right

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,200
um things happen when they're ready and

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,440
then we we do the things we do often so

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,039
the the management timelines that need

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,240
to be used as norms had to be updated to

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,520
reflect that change you know if you're

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,360
working on open telemetry

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,799
the timelines that you have may not be

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,080
100 solid

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,520
you know 90 days out six months out it

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
will get more and more solid as you get

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,240
closer to the day

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,679
so we update our uh engineering

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
management practices to reflect that so

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
people didn't get

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,960
dinged for working on projects that were

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,960
critically important to us

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,400
this one's a kind of a i know that this

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,679
one doesn't seem like it's a big deal it

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
seems relatively straightforward but

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,400
it's actually was kind of a big deal to

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,200
some of our developers

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
um and this is single track development

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
uh

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
none of none of our instrumentation team

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
none of our development

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
would be done half in open source half

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,320
and closed we're going to be working all

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,000
in the open all the time

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,840
having multiple code repositories is not

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,360
acceptable there was a bit of

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
consternation around this but

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,559
overall this was what the team decided

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
to do and this is what we implemented

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,400
and honestly i think it's really a

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,159
really good process policy to have

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,320
to work in the open on your open source

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,799
projects

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,120
we update our hiring profile as well um

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,640
prior to the open by default project

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,919
we hadn't emphasized open source

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,000
development it wasn't the thing that we

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
had really prioritized at all in hiring

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
uh and we needed update ironing profile

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,039
to align with that better

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,880
so we revised the attributes and traits

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,039
that we look for in the new hire or in

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,799
new hires we revised the code challenge

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,960
to allow candidates to demonstrate their

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,400
ability to work in open source projects

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,200
um

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,240
is as opposed to our previous uh code or

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,799
coding challenge

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,720
so really just change the emphasis of a

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,159
hiring profile to people that had worked

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,520
in open source and had

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,720
knowledge of how to work in open source

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,720
and it could show their contributions

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,200
and then lastly is the moderation

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,320
guidelines so we have a site called the

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
explorers hub

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
um it's a form for our customers

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
especially developers

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,159
to learn how do i build with new relic

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,320
how can i build on top of new relic

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,919
um and users can post questions and

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
answers get feedback you know all

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,480
the normal stuff so for our open source

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
project categories and explorers hub

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,080
we defined a process that detailed the

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,760
expectations and norms for

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,159
any questions that required engineering

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,360
support as well as a response cadence

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,720
for this engineering team so that

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,720
questions wouldn't just sit there stale

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,360
so we went through we did all this

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
planning we executed on it we had all

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,400
these changes like were we successful

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,440
um with the initial july 30th launch uh

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,520
yeah i think it's

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
an understatement to be honest we not

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
only hit all of the instrumentation we

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,960
had planned

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,840
in open source by july 30th we hit it

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,760
far before

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,080
and we actually pushed up the the launch

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,880
date a week to july 22nd

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,399
um which was awesome like it was nothing

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
anybody really expected until we started

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,960
getting into it and then you start

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,640
seeing all these projects start clicking

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,080
on like oh can i put the license in

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
yeah license drops in and it's open

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
source you know they apply the template

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,120
oh hey i'm ready to put the license on

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,799
the ruby agent like okay do it click and

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
now you have an open source agent

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
it was it was cool to see that happen

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,320
and just watch it accelerate

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,840
right up to the july 22nd date and it

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,480
was really really cool and really you

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,080
know

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
it felt great to be able to get it done

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
early it's not something you usually get

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,000
done early doing something like this

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
but when you really think about it how

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,320
do you manage your success beyond that

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,360
launch right

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
um the other major success that we

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,399
wanted to look at was how well our

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,760
engineers adopted to these new open

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,760
source practices

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,240
as well as how engaged the community was

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,159
around our products that we open sourced

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,840
and to satisfy this at least initially

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,440
looking at what we were going to measure

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
we looked at the open source guide on

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
open source metrics

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,080
which is you know the open source guides

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
are developed by github they're super

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
useful

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,240
so we looked at that and we implemented

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
a lot of the metrics that they provided

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,159
and the plan going forward is basically

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,679
a baseline and work towards improving

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,279
every area covered in that guide

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,120
and the four areas that guide coverage

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
are discovery usage retention and

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,720
maintainer activity

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
so really make sure that we're doing

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
well or improving in all four of those

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,320
areas

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,240
um but by that measure

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
like were we a success like we don't

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
know yet right

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
i'm telling you what we did not where

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
we're going to be at the end we're still

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
in the process we don't know we're still

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
baselining

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
we're trying to figure out this was

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,279
successful and if it's not what we need

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
to do

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
but having these metrics defined

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
beforehand helps us identify when

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,279
something isn't working

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,520
with our policies and processes

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,200
especially so that we can take steps to

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,520
immediate the problem

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
and that could be you know revising a

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
policy

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,039
or a process it could be providing

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
initial training if we're not doing

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,200
something well if we're not training our

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,360
engineers uh

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,840
sufficiently or it could be taking it to

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
a you know a project leader if there's a

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,000
problems on specific teams to find out

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
what's going on

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,240
all right talk to y'all for a while now

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,919
uh gone into probably more detail than

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
your i thought i would or you really

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,919
cared to hear

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
uh but you probably have one question

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,320
like

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,159
great so what like why am i here like

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,440
why is this guy up here telling us about

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,640
how new relic open-sourced their

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,039
instrumentation

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
um especially why is this marketing guy

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,840
here right what's he selling

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,360
right uh so i'm here today because uh

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,440
i'm a marketing guy but i'm an open

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,200
source guy first um

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,720
i think this story is important i think

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,000
these stories are important to tell

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,520
i think these stories are important for

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,399
other people here uh

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,080
and i think that our experience gives

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,120
other companies other organizations

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,760
other teams

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,000
like a way to start thinking about how

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,720
they would open source code

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,840
so what am i selling you today i'm not

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,600
selling you new relic like our

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,720
platform's awesome go try it our free

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,919
tier is great that's not what i'm

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,120
selling you though i'm selling you on an

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,799
idea

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,200
and since we're at all things open i bet

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,520
everybody here basically believes in it

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,480
but i bet a lot of you don't action on

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
it

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,679
and that idea is that open source is

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,960
important and more importantly

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,600
if you have software that's good it's

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,640
useful

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,640
you should open source it

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,039
if your software is not a competitive

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,520
advantage

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,799
but it's useful you should open source

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,000
it

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,440
the world runs on software i believe and

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
we believe in new relic

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,279
all the people i work with believe that

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,039
to build

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,399
a more perfect internet like a better

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,399
world

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,159
that we need to build better software

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,080
and the way we can best do that is by

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,039
doing it together

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,120
and that starts with each of us sharing

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,799
open sourcing what we can so that we all

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,279
can build with each other's work

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,640
so that we all can do better so if it's

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,399
not a competitive advantage

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,519
open source it like it's not simple

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,039
it can be difficult but if we can do it

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,640
if new relic can do it

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,840
you can do it this is our story right

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,760
learn from us do it better than we did

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,440
then come back and share your story with

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,440
everybody so they can learn from you

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
it's not an exaggeration to say that you

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,480
know soon

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
if we all start doing this we all take

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,080
this mindset we all start open sourcing

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,760
what we can

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
the open sourcing software isn't like a

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,559
one-off weird thing at companies anymore

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,679
it's not a one-off

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,000
hard difficult thing to do it's a normal

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,000
everyday standard process for all of us

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,960
all the time

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,240
so go out look at your software and open

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,399
source what you can

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,000
that's my ask of you guys today all

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,120
right thank you all

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,799
uh this is my linkedin my twitter um up

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,919
there also there's new rail at the sign

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,200
up page if you guys want to go check

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
that out it's pretty awesome to be
