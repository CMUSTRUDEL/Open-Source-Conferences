Description: 
	Presented by: Kevin Nelson & Randy Olinger, UnitedHealth Group/Optum
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: Executing open source strategy which works at scale inside a large complex corporation is all about understanding the needs of each constituent group, the questions they need to get answered, and what tools can be infused into existing processes so all parties succeed. Organizations typically have open source strategies which revolve around cost reduction, managing technical debt and increasing speed to market.  But these strategies must meet the needs of several critical groups in order to be successful; including the engineering community, technology leadership, and the in-house legal department.

For example, open source consumption is all the rage in large organizations primarily in hopes of reducing license costs in the short term.  While this is a great reason to use open source, it is far from the only reason and ignores the obligations that go along with adopting an open source code base.  UHG/Optum has developed and released an enterprise grade tool to the open source community that will recursively analyze a source code tree and report on all open source library and framework licenses, as well as divulge security threats as listed in the NIST National Vulnerability Database.  Use of such a tool allows architectural guidance and governance for specific projects.

Kevin and Randy will walk attendees through the primary UHG OSPO customer personas, and how they employ processes and open source tools such as the one described to play a vital role in the engineering success for a Fortune 5 company with a technology team over 28K members strong.

	00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,359
good morning

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,720
good afternoon or i guess good evening

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
depending on where you are in the world

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
um

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,799
randy and i are excited to be here we've

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
got some interesting stuff to

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
to share with you today in keeping with

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,640
the nature of this track

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
uh being a case study we're gonna try to

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
spend a little bit less time on

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,119
on slides and a little bit more time

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,000
doing some live demos it's always risky

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,160
but we're gonna

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,519
we're gonna take a chance here and and

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
hopefully show you some cool stuff

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,480
that'll help you with your open source

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,760
program office

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
um real quick let's let's run through a

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
few things

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,520
just some introductions myself um i've

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
been

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
working in this open source program

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
office field for for the better part of

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,399
10 years

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,879
although as i'm sure many of you know uh

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
this field has evolved quite a bit

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,960
um i am an attorney that's how i got

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
involved in it from the governance side

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,640
um randy is much more technical than i

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
you know he's he's helped us with a lot

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,600
of the

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
the tooling and so forth that we

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
developed

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
but uh we we started the open source

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
program office a couple years ago

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
and it we we've made a pretty good start

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
and we're proud of some of the things

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,760
we've done

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,759
randy go ahead hi i'm uh engineer

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,119
uh here at optum i achieved the

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
illustrious title of distinguished

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,280
engineer

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,720
um i've been in software engineering and

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
test systems engineering

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,000
uh for over 30 years and i think um

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,880
what i one thing that that has

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,840
contributed to my to the makeup of my

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
personality is that i am frugal and uh

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
so i kind of

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
started really digging into open source

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,320
probably 20 years ago

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,840
thinking it was uh going to be very

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
useful both in my home life

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
and in in the work life and in the last

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
10 years it's

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
it's become more and more accepted my

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
participation in this project

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,119
has been around infrastructure as code

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
expert might be a little bit of a strong

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,159
but i'm

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
i'm getting pretty good at it and i've

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,479
been in the healthcare manufacturing

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,759
domains

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,159
in my career uh i worked for a

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,360
another large company that had

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
manufacturing plants and i think

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,959
bringing

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
some of that skill set and the learnings

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
from

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
how to streamline operations really

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
helped me understand

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
information technology better all right

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
thanks randy

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
um just real quick a quick disclaimer

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
randy and i are speaking for ourselves

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
these are our opinions

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
a lot of the things that i might talk

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
about might touch on legal topics

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
please don't take that as legal advice

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,720
and as always please check with your own

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,480
professional legal counsel for any

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,760
particular issues you might have

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,080
real quick one of the things that you

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,239
need to understand to

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
to see the perspective to see where

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
we're coming from is we've tried to

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,480
implement these tools to run our open

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
source program office

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,319
is that we're dealing with extremely

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
large volumes

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,319
so anytime we go to implement tools or

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
look at vendors

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
we always have to consider size and can

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
they handle the volume and are we going

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,159
to make an investment that we can't

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
get away from five years later so this

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
slide is just

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
something to throw up there to give you

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
a feel for the kind of of

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
sizing that we have to deal with we're

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
talking about 28 000

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,040
plus engineers we're talking last glance

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,879
over 8 000 individual applications

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
most of which are only used internal to

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
our organization so that also sort of

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
colors our opinion

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
although we do do some commercial

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
products and services

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,760
they almost all used open source we're

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
in 140 countries

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,879
around the world our technology

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,480
organization as a whole

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
again we're a public company so these

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,319
numbers are all public

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,720
uh you know we invest over 3.6 billion

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:50,239
dollars in technology

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,040
annually annually right and um again we

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
we've got lots of people over 325 000

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
people

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,840
across all groups within opt-in so

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,720
everything we do we have to worry about

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
size

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,239
go ahead randy oh what we do here uh at

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,439
this company is

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
our our mission statement is dual uh

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,040
helping

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,159
people live healthier lives and which i

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
always have to be reminded making the

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,480
health system work better for everyone

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,639
we're trying to

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,959
quote unquote uh fix the health system

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
we have business units that are

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
separated into

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
two basic operating entities one is

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,479
united healthcare that is

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
we provide benefits uh or our insurance

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,960
administration so

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
just you know we provide health

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
insurance for people

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
and we process claims and we manage

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
networks of doctors

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,759
and we negotiate discounts and it's kind

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,960
of classic

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
insurance for both self-funded and

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,120
also we we will fund or take the risk as

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,479
well

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,560
in that operation we generate

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
mountains of data which is extremely

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
useful for other types of health

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,520
services and for research

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
so we have this other business called

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,080
optimum health services and

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
that is um kind of a kitchen sink of

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,479
many

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,400
different operating entities that cover

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,080
uh everything else in the health system

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
besides the insurance

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
and uh so things we do are like nurse

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
chat lines

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
um or we'll send nurses into people's

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,520
homes with house calls we've

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
recently just made the move into primary

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
care so we've been

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,639
acquiring and growing basically doctors

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
offices and clinics

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
around the country we're not really big

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
into hospitals

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
yet but we seem to get into everything

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
we have the largest

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
behavioral health services in the

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,600
country we manage

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,240
literally thousands of behavioral health

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
experts

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
and millions of patients and you know we

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,039
do that

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,680
by taking our technology

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
and integrating it with data and insight

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
at scale

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,120
and as kevin said before scale is

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
pretty much been key to the success of

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,680
this company from the beginning

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
but going after the big picture has been

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,199
the

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,680
strategic win over the last five to ten

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
years

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
particularly in the united states we do

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
operate internationally

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
uh we are in the country of brazil in

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
pretty big way we have a large presence

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,120
there

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,280
and we do consulting and services at

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
several countries around the world

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,919
but as you can guess the united states

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,199
you know has a unique health system and

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:29,440
is where our expertise is is is based

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,639
all right so again real quickly and i

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
promise we're almost done with the slide

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
where we'll get on to some of the cool

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
stuff

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
just to kind of show you where we fit

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
within our organization from an open

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,039
source program office perspective

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,319
i'm sure most of you have seen diagrams

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,240
like this in in the past

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
it just kind of shows how we deal with

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
policy and process we deal with legal

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,120
requirements security requirements

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
and then we also give back to the open

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,520
source community

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,800
we're working hard to ramp that up as we

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,479
speak we've got a big

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
upstream engineering program that's

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,680
gotten started this year but today

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
specifically what we're going to talk

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
about

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
is this top box up here on the right

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,360
about how we do our open source

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
consumption governance and tools we use

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
to get that done

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
again at our scale and at the volume we

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
have to deal with and we're also going

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
to talk about

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
how we do our upstream engineering the

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
governance around

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,319
contributing back to open source and

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
some of the tools we've done

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
and hopefully what you'll find really

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
useful out of this and what you can

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,919
share

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
is that all the tools we're going to

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
show you today we have open source we

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,160
have released

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,560
to our public optum

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
organization on github and so therefore

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
you can

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
test them out try them out open issues

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,880
you can tell us where we did it right or

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
wrong and you can help us make them

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,599
better

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
so we're going to show you stuff and

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
then we're going to share the code with

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
you and hopefully

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
we can all do a better job at this sort

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,319
of thing

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,759
all right randy's going to talk about

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
the engineering you know what do we have

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,240
to do for them

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,560
yeah so there's a lot of statements on

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
this slide that are descriptive

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
of what an engineer might think about

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
open source starting with you know why

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,560
is this important a lot of times

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,840
uh we find that engineers are not aware

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,000
of some of the rules or uh

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,039
importance around open source in terms

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
of being compliant

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,039
with the uh the obligations in the

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,599
license so we you know we start off with

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
the why

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
and we try to answer the why and then

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
they ask why and they

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
do usually five rounds of y before you

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,960
get everything across

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,360
um we found a while ago we were using

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,360
another product in the marketplace that

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
seemed like everybody else was using

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
uh but it did not it did not make sense

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
after a while because it wasn't

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,519
scratching the itch that we had which

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
was our our scale

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
and automation we wanted something that

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
would be

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
frictionless for the developers to use

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
or at least very low friction

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,640
and that's to increase adoption because

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
as a large company

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,240
we have had a lot of tools be purchased

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
over the years

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
and then find them sitting on the shelf

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
or

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
ignored after six months to a year

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,519
because they were just too darn hard

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,519
you know people don't have to do that um

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,839
so our our use case uh brought in

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
uh we wanted open source licensing and

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
vulnerability

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,160
analysis and management uh had to be

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,360
something that

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,360
users could use themselves and

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
we wanted it to be api driven so people

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,560
could integrate it into their processes

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,399
uh in in new and innovative ways

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
again extremely high volume we have

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
thousands of projects that we want to

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
analyze

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,000
and um we had to get it in there

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,480
with uh without much impact

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
the vast majority of this this last

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
statement on the slide about our

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
software we do sell software in the open

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,920
market

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
uh but most of what we're doing in our

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,240
development world

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,560
is for internal use uh where we we use

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
it

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,880
uh to manage people's workflows during

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,920
the day

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,480
or to manage portals for in uh for

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,279
customers to come to on the internet and

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
we have

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,839
you know fairly high number of

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,880
concurrent users in those portals so

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,440
it's important for things to scale

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
all right so now we'll move away from

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
the safety of

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
powerpoint slides and and we'll actually

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
show you some things

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
we developed a tool called barista and

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
there's just some

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,240
logos up here of all the different

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,560
technologies and the technology stack

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,680
that we use to put it together

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,959
but what i'm going to do now is move us

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,279
over to a live demo this is an azure

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,399
hosted instance of our tool um it's

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,839
public so there's

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,680
there's nothing in here that's that's

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
a problem for us to show you i've

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,399
already logged into it we'll try to show

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
you different pieces

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,079
as we go through today but the idea is

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
we want to show you how this is

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,279
important to different groups within our

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,519
organization

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,279
so randy was just talking about what the

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,880
engineering community needs

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,360
and so we're going to take a look at

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
that first and i think

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
randy we were going to talk about use

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
the web go project as an example so i'll

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
go ahead and bring that up and you can

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,000
kind of talk about

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,360
what's here so what we we like to see

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
is something that's visually appealing

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
so we put a little work uh into

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
some good good libraries but the the the

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,560
big thing here is to give

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,200
an at a glance view of the state of your

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
of your application um the way barista

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
works

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,360
is the end user would

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,720
uh give us their github location and

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
then some processes run in the

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
background

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
here's our detailed slide that that this

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
is what the user would enter to get

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,360
their custom

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
their project into the into the system

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
anyway they would

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
instigate a state a scan could go back

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,920
to the overview real quick and

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
let's just go over this the pie charts a

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
scan would run

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,279
and it would end up showing them what

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,720
what kind of license they use and what

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,320
kind of security

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
holes they have we're using open source

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
processes or projects

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
to perform those two tasks behind the

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,560
scenes

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
but the the data from those projects was

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,279
not easily consumable

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
we found and the reason we built a

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,040
portal around it was to make it

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,399
something that would would drive

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
utilization if we just gave people a

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,880
bunch of scripts and said go run these

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,560
on your project

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,480
some might do it but the data would just

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,120
be fragmented all over the organization

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
this gives us the ability to easily scan

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
projects at scale

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,160
and store the data in a way that's

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,480
easily retrievable and that we can run

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
analytics and reports against

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
if you want to click on the scans tab

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,480
we'll show a scan real quick

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,079
so this is where the the user would

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
initiate a scan and they hit the plus

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,240
scan button we don't need to do it right

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
now but

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
uh when they click on a scan it will

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,720
show the results of that

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,000
and terms of licenses and security so

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,839
here's an example

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,360
of all the licenses that are used in

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
this web goat project

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,160
and the takeaway message is people are

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,880
often surprised at how many licenses

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
fall on on their project they they

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
hadn't

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,279
they never knew they never even bothered

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,279
to look in most cases they just figured

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
it was okay to use all this stuff

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
and in most cases it is but it's

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
important uh

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,920
it's becoming more and more important

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,519
especially if you're distributing

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
software or making

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,600
deals customers are asking for proof

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
that you understand your licenses and

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
your

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
obligations and that you're meeting them

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
so that they don't end up getting

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,760
encumbered with

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,399
um a legal battle sometime in the future

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,519
so like uh in this particular product

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,040
we're seeing

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,279
the eclipse we're seeing canoe we're

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,959
seeing apache we're seeing mit

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
you know each one of those has its own

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,920
obligations that you need to follow

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,360
and luckily it's a lot of overlap so

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
it's not

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
impossible but we needed something that

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
would aggregate that together

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
into one list which if you go back to

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,440
top you can

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,399
click on our obligations tab

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
and sure well that's sorry yeah go ahead

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
go ahead

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,000
i just want to mention again from an

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,199
engineering perspective the one thing

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that barista does

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,040
that i think a lot of even vendor tools

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
doesn't do

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,760
is we not only look at your primary

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,160
project dependency manifest we actually

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
go

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
and dig through your your primary

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
dependencies

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,680
the dependencies of those which are your

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,440
secondary dependencies your tertiary

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880
dependencies we run all the way down the

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
dependency tree

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,920
and as randy said a lot of folks are

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,959
surprised

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,959
when they look at their projects and the

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,880
bill of materials and realize that

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,800
hey i'm only referencing you know a

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,639
dozen primary dependencies

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,639
but those dozen primary dependencies

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,160
once you run down the dependency tree

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,839
can bring back hundreds or even

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
thousands of secondary and tertiary

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,360
dependencies

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,920
this example project as you saw down

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,240
there at the bottom has something like

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,519
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,680
dependencies once you run down the tree

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
right and that's you know it's very

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
difficult

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,880
for people to track that stuff manually

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,079
without using some sort of a tool

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
and the other thing we found that was a

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,760
surprise

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,079
was the um acceptance by our community

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,959
of the security results so we

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,000
didn't plan on doing security scanning

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
in barista

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,680
but the tools we use some of them did

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,560
that as well or there were tools that

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
were easy to

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,320
add so we said well let's go ahead and

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,480
add it and see if anybody looks at it

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
and as it turned out that was a huge

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
feature for teams

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
because they'd been inundated with

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
security tools by our centralized

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,279
security team that weren't

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,079
always either easy to use or they didn't

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
always provide

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,600
information that was actionable or

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,040
useful where

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
when they would run barista the first

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,920
thing i found was they would actually

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,920
start

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
if they saw security items they would go

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,720
deal with them and then they'd fix them

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
or they'd ask us for advice and

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,639
how do we go rescan this or how do we

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
fix this and it's like they cared we

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,040
were very surprised it was it was a

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
great thing

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,199
so um what what brista does is it

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,880
scans against the cve database uh and or

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,959
from from the nist

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,120
and then categorizes them pulls the

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,000
categories as high lower critical and

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,399
gives them a nice list of work to do and

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
um

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
i find that when you give developers a

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,000
list they're pretty good at turning that

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,279
into

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,199
projects and and taking them off

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,560
and that's also going to mention too we

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,800
pull back all that data from the

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,920
national vulnerability database so

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,519
the all the details are here

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,600
so they can even see you know what was

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,279
the origin of these reported

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,399
vulnerabilities they can go back to the

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
original

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,519
reporting entities and how the national

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
institute for

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,880
science and technology found out about

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,040
them so that can be useful when they're

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,959
trying to fix things

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,120
yep and that's scanning so the

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,240
uh last thing we were gonna are not the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
last thing but another thing we're gonna

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
talk about is the software build

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
materials

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,600
or also known as an s-bom and uh

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
this is useful for teams that want to

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,199
have a look at

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,279
all the products as kevin was mentioned

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,480
when you follow the dependencies

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,639
all the way down this gives them a list

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,160
that they can then refer to

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
when they when someone asks a question

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
of well what modules are you using

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
in in addition though since this is a

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,079
centralized data store

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,079
this is starting to build a repository

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,360
for our enterprise of all the different

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
open source software

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,160
that we are relying on and using so when

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,880
it comes time for when someone says

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
hey there's an impacted thing like uh

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
openssl

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
who all is using that we can easily go

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
to the database and pull out a list

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,600
of of areas that we know are using and

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,679
it may need to remediate something

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
sure and and we can we can show you that

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,000
here we've got our

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
our module search feature um

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
i i'll look for something here that i

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,799
know is in our sample database

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
so you can find um occurrences of

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,600
anything

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
that refers to to apache beans for

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,480
example you can see that web go project

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
we were looking at

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,160
um has it if i click on it it'll show me

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
the exact

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,200
module that i found so you can you can

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,039
use it to do impact analysis and again

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,960
from an engineering perspective

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
that's really valuable and by the way in

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,480
the chat in the

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,400
zoom chat i put the urls

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,880
for barista again all this is open

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,720
source it's all out there

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
anybody can get this set up and running

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
hopefully with the minimum of effort if

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
you want to try it out yourself

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
yeah to that as if you're familiar with

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
uh docker and docker compose that's all

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
it takes to run this

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,880
uh there's instructions at our github

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,640
for how to pull it off

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
but to get a basic instance running that

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,760
will do scans and give you an

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,000
idea uh the ability to demonstrate it

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,520
to people it's all there and very easy

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
to do from either a

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,320
small server or a cloud instance

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,919
we run this uh with kubernetes or

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,160
openshift in the background

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,960
meaning we have it set to dynamically

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
scale

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,480
if we find usage gets high we haven't

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,720
found it to be a problem yet where we

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,880
need to just scale it too much

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,080
but it was built as an enterprise uh

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
level type of asset uh not as a bespoke

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,080
workstation

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,200
or um you know snowflake implementation

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,600
system cool and this is our net we call

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,520
this our nascar slide right or i don't

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
but it's got all of our vendors just

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,840
wanted to point out that

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,360
these are the products that we use to

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,200
implement barista

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,559
there are also higher level modules or

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,679
scanning tools that are integrated that

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,520
these tools helped us

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,080
integrate so there are some other

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
props we could give later sure and we'll

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
jump back into the tool in a few minutes

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,840
but again now we want to talk about it

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,280
from another perspective so

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,240
um as an attorney i work with our

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,799
in-house counsel

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
all the time because if you've tried to

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,520
run an open source program office you

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
know that the groups that you have to

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
keep happy

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,720
are your in-house counsel your

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,640
engineering community

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,039
your procurement community if you if you

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,520
have a big procurement office

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
um as well as your security folks and so

00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
we wanted

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,440
today to kind of give you a pers our

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,320
perspective from each of those

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,679
uh different personas so from the from

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,280
the in-house council perspective when

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,400
they're thinking about open source

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,720
you know they're thinking about how can

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,360
we automate it again 28 000

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
developers 8 000 applications this is

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,320
not something that we're going to hire

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,679
an army of attorneys to look at

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,000
so we have to be able to set up

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,600
automated rules to look at the results

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,880
of those scans that randy was talking

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,200
about

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
um you know training contribution

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
license agreements

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,799
if your company does any merger and

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,600
acquisition activity how do you respond

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
to due diligence questions or or so

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,240
forth

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
you know how do you respond to rfps from

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,640
your customers a lot of times

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,559
customers nowadays as part of their

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
vendor management will say hey show me

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,600
how your product or service is using

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
open source because i want to make sure

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
you don't introduce something into my

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,200
environment

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,200
that's going to cause an issue so these

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
are all things that we have to deal with

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,280
and again barista was an attempt to

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,120
have a self-service tool that was as

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,919
automated as possible that could operate

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,320
at volume so again let's just jump back

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,679
over to

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,880
the tool and

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,720
we'll show you a couple other things

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
that for example the attorneys might be

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,280
interested in

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,159
so if i if i jump back over to my my

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,520
projects

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,039
and i'll go back over to um to our my

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
web goat project again just because it's

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,919
a good example

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
one of the things that's really helpful

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,200
from a legal perspective

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
is the ability to customize obligations

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
in plain english

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,679
that anybody can understand so

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,280
essentially what we've done and i've

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,640
just got a few samples set up in this

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,480
this demo site

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,799
but in our internal site we've gone

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,080
through all the licenses

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,000
that are being used and consumed we've

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,120
taken the licenses themselves

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,159
we've taken the obligations or the

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
things that you're supposed to

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,600
affirmatively do

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,039
if you use software with that is

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,320
licensed according to those open source

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,559
licenses

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,159
and we've laid them out here so that the

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,039
project managers and the engineering

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,799
community

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,720
can understand without having to read a

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,760
bunch of legalese as to what

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,440
is required it also gives

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,799
your organization or in this case our

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
organization

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,240
an opportunity to word things

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
that involve risk mitigation you know

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,760
sometimes we even go beyond the license

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
right we want to be

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,440
center of the circle ethically we want

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,520
to respect copyrights

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
of anybody for third-party intellectual

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
property that we're using

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
so because you can customize those

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
obligations you can associate them with

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
different licenses

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,120
once the scan is done you can go to this

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,440
tab and it'll lay out here

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
here are your obligations for example

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,559
almost every open source license

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,159
requires attribution of some sort

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
it's worded lots of different ways and

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,039
lots of different licenses but we kind

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,240
of distill it down

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
to some of the basics right we want to

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
make sure

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,600
that for most licenses that we keep open

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,320
source components isolated right

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
this is sort of a copy and paste rule in

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
other words

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,280
you know don't go to an open source

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,200
component that you like grab a function

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,480
or some code and just copy and paste it

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,559
into your own code

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
right instead use it in a more

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,520
appropriate modern software development

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
fashion which is

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,200
you know make it a dependency you know

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,440
make your your function call

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,280
all those kinds of things but all this

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,799
can be can be customized

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,640
i'll pull up here one of the

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,159
administration screens just to give you

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,720
a feel so

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,679
we can write rules based on the licenses

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,159
and based on the use case

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,480
so our in-house council loves the fact

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,960
that

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,320
and i apologize for covering over part

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,480
of this maybe i can move that there we

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,480
go

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
so for example a lot of folks worry

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,000
about agpl licensing because it's

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,880
incompatible with certain use cases

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,880
so what we can do

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,559
is we can we can associate

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,120
rules that say you know for the

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
agpl license um if you're if your use

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
case is going to distribute that code

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,279
when you first set up that your project

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,559
to scan you have to tell us how your

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,559
your project is going to be used you

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,919
know is it internal is it going to be

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,600
hosted as a website

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,200
or are you going to distribute that

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,240
software outside the company

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,919
and in this case if it's if it's an agpl

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,600
licensed open source component that

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
you're going to use that we find when we

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
scan your

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,480
your project you know we're going to

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,679
throw up a big red flag and say hey if

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,000
it's distributed

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
that's a problem right we need to stop

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
and reevaluate and those kind of things

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,559
but our in-house council loves the

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,080
ability to dynamically set up these

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,080
these rules which is really helpful

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,120
another thing they like and again i'll

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
go back to our our web go project

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,440
a new feature that we just added pretty

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,559
recently to barista

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,520
is this attribution tab essentially what

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,320
this does

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
is it builds a downloadable file that

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
has

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,080
all of the copyright information and all

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,679
of the license text

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,360
that allows a a project manager or

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,200
project owner

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,799
to comply with the attribution

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,760
requirement they can literally download

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,520
this file

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
include it in the distribution of their

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,720
software if it gets distributed

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,000
if it's a hosted piece of software that

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,799
is you know hosted in one of our data

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,520
centers or in one of our cloud

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,720
leased facilities then um they can

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,279
include this as a you know

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,720
readme or a legal link in the in the

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,279
website

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
but this makes it really easy the the

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,679
project manager

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,039
the technical folks don't have to go

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
pull all this together

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,400
barista pulls it all together as part of

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,320
the scan

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
and if anybody's aware of microsoft's

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
project in the last year or so called

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,799
clearly defined dot io

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,279
that's our source for all this

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,000
information and that way we're

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
pretty assured that as thinking changes

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
or as people discover new things about

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
new components

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,120
it's going to stay up to date so again

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
our legal folks are really happy that we

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,279
can pull this sort of

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,480
bill of materials package manifest

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,279
attribution file

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,080
together for them all right

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,760
let's jump back over to our our next

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,559
group here

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,080
randy you want to talk a little bit

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,360
about what the procurement folks are

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,400
worried about

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,200
yes so for uh for a long time uh

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,480
our company and and many other companies

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,080
uh would not

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,760
allow open source software because they

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,159
were worried about lawsuits just you

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,919
know going back 15 years

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
uh thanks to kevin's work and a few

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,400
others that has largely been eradicated

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,320
and now

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
using open source as a strategy but our

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,640
vendors uh

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
i'm sorry our procurement experts our

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,520
purchasing team

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,039
they still want to do diligence as we

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
bring in new um

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,640
software to make sure that we're using

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,440
it even if it is open source and

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,840
free is in free beer open source so we

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,919
uh

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,440
also built in functionality in the tool

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,600
to allow

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,880
people that essentially do that

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,080
diligence on software

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
to enter in projects just like

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,080
everything else

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,480
that will record

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,200
the licensing for anything that is being

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
distributed

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,840
this particularly hits our desktop

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,120
software where we have

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,600
packages that are more individual usage

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
based

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,159
it's not so much about libraries but

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
they want to make sure that they've at

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,480
least recorded it

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,960
the the obligations are really the same

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,320
though

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,679
and the um the

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,399
warranty clauses uh in open source often

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,200
we want to make sure that we're uh we're

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,919
aware

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,360
of what those are and or are not in most

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,760
cases

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,640
um we also have a

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,000
um a place where a vendor was building

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,840
something custom for us

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,039
and we wanted to know what are the rules

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
for that open source

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,640
framework so we were able to help the

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,960
vendor figure out

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
what their obligations were and catch it

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,919
before it went off the

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,799
off the rails because when you're having

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,240
a third party build things for you

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,279
you often don't have control all right

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
i want to do a little bit of a time

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,600
check because we've only got about 15

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,679
minutes left so

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,360
i want to make sure to get to everything

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,360
um one of the last groups that

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,840
everybody's always concerned about is

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,120
you know what does executive leadership

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,640
think what are they worried about

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,760
they're often real excited about saving

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,159
money when you're using

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,440
open source software but you know they

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
want to know what about exposure to

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,399
vulnerabilities which we've already

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
talked about and how barista helps us

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,320
with that

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,919
they want to know about software

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,240
builders and materials and those kind of

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,480
things can we govern this at scale

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
again we talked about the the whole

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
purpose and the structure of baristas

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,159
that it's self-service

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,640
so there is no central choke point um

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
the start

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,559
the software itself is rules driven and

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,600
based on the scans

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,880
we give engineers answers the one

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,799
feature in briefs that we haven't shown

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
you that our executives do like because

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,399
it gives them a high level overview

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,720
and let me jump back over here to the

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,720
tool

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,120
is something that we put in place this

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,720
summer

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,279
um randy if you want to talk about this

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,600
just a second yeah i mean this was uh

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,960
again having the data centralized in a

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,399
large data store gives us the ability to

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,279
do some analytics so we can

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,240
make pretty charts but we basically

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,640
wanted to know

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,159
uh from a metrics point of view are we

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
getting better or are we getting worse

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,120
so they can get a quick glance come in

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
and find out

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,520
how vulnerable are we how many of our

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,240
projects have high vulnerabilities so we

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,799
were able to do

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,480
a quick compute with a simple sql query

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,240
and put that on the front page

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
we can also show what our

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,080
vulnerabilities are that's the the

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,159
chart below and um also give

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,600
some aggregate counts of of where what

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,480
kind of licenses we're using which

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,159
turned out to be

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,679
a surprise to most people they didn't

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,840
they would have probably thought gpl was

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,120
our number one license but mit by far is

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,559
our number one license

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,480
uh if you go back to the top real quick

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,960
kevin i wanted to also point out

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,159
that as a user you can look at it from

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,440
your own

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,360
data or you can look at it at an

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
organize organization wide which is

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,360
really scanning the entire database

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,720
in this example instance there's not

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
enough data to really show difference

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,320
between those two

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,159
but in our internal internally deployed

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,880
version of this we have hundreds of of

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,120
projects

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,159
and uh you can you know as a user you

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,480
can come in and find

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
what do i have a problem am i worse in

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
the organization am i better than the

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,480
organization

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,799
do i have some work to fix so this has

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,960
turned out to be pretty popular

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,880
all right thanks randy um so

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,640
um we've been talking a lot about our

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,919
barista tool we put out there again it's

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,760
open source it's out there

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,039
please go out and take a look at it you

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,360
know watch what we're doing

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,279
ask questions in the issues download it

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,440
deploy it

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,559
see if you can break it tell us what we

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
can do to make it better

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,080
we really would like to build a

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,159
community around barista and

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,240
it's something we put out there to share

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,760
with everyone

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,600
i promise at the beginning we talk about

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,200
our upstream engineering program

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,320
so this is kind of the opposite of of

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,360
what barista is designed for

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,360
this is our concept of how we govern

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,120
giving software back to the open source

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
community

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,320
we call it upstream engineering we

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,679
didn't create that name i think i'm

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,279
sure i grabbed it from the to-do group

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,640
at the linux foundation or or something

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,880
like that

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
but i want to talk real briefly about

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
sort of how our process

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,000
works and then i'll show you the results

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,960
of the tools that we

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
use to track this so in our case we've

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
got

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,480
corporate policies of course you know

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,880
where a public company everything has to

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,279
be

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
done by policy the policy says it's

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
allowed to

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
contribute back to open source as long

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,399
as you follow certain rules and

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,200
processes

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,720
okay we came up with those rules the

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,080
rules have to do with certain kinds of

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
reviews that are required you're

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
required to have

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,480
sponsorship by a leader in the

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,200
organization someone

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,240
who would know if it's a good thing from

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,159
a business perspective

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,240
to for us to contribute back to a

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,200
particular project

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,880
so we require leadership sponsorship we

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,039
require technical reviews

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,840
peer reviews to make sure that the code

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,000
that we're putting out there is good

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,880
code

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,880
we require security reviews we obviously

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,399
don't want to put any code out there

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
into the world into the open source

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,840
ecosystem that causes a problem for

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
folks so

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,559
you have to get a security review of any

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,240
pull request or contribution that you're

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
going to put out there

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,000
all that's covered in a class by the way

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
we use an automatic

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,279
an automated learning management system

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
to do that i'm sure

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,000
most people do you know something like

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,200
moodle or whatever to to put your

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,720
class together so everybody has to take

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,679
that before they can be an approved

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,679
upstream engineer

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
that happens and then we use a process

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,840
where

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,200
again our our corporate um

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,000
approach is self-service so we created a

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,679
github repo

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,760
internally we have an enterprise github

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
installation internally

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,039
and there's really only two required

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,279
fires for those files

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:16,000
in this repo one is a markdown file of

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,200
the list of open source communities that

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,279
have been approved for

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
contribution again based on those

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,720
leadership reviews i do a legal review

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,440
of it to make sure they have

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,039
licenses and contribution policies that

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,120
are acceptable

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,240
so there's one list of approved

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,000
communities

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,519
and then there's one list of approved

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
contributors you know the people

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,799
that have taken that class and agreed to

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,440
follow the rules

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,000
okay and then with those two simple

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,159
files

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,679
in our our our github repo internally

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,159
any engineer in the company any of those

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,519
28 000 people can go out to that repo

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,519
they can do a pull request against

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,600
both of those files to add a new

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,799
uh approved community or to to add

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,360
themselves to the list of approved

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,320
contributors if they've taken the class

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,080
and from there we've got an automated

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,399
api that runs that we host

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,280
we created that reads from those files

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,520
every day

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,200
it goes and checks all of the people

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,280
against all of the approved places

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,240
out on github to see what they've

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,079
actually done

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,240
and that way we can track all of the

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,440
code that we put out in the world

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,560
and that's the automated part that we're

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,320
going to share with you we've open

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,119
source that

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,679
so i just have a slide here that shows a

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,520
sample of our internal

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,520
our internal repo there's an example of

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,919
both of those files i was talking about

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,520
the one on the left is the markdown file

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,679
where we ask you to

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,280
to tell us the information we need to

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,480
review for any given community that

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,079
we're going to

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
contribute to and that's true whether

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,800
it's a public community that we have

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,879
nothing to do with

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
or if it's a community that that optum

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,520
or united health group has published

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,359
ourselves and sponsored and then over on

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,440
the right is a simple text file

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,280
of the public identity the public github

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,839
identity of our people

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,079
that want to be approved to contribute

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,079
so it's really that simple

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,760
let me just jump in um if any of you out

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,960
there are wondering you know why are we

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,560
bothering with all this

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,040
the title of talk was open source on

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,079
purpose and what we have

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,079
realized is that um if you let

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,359
this go without any kind of

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,119
understanding or control

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,560
it's very hard to put the genie back in

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,160
the bottle if your

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,760
employees are out and they just start

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,720
randomly contributing under your name

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,599
the company could be

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,000
at great risk or just wouldn't even know

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,480
where

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
all the company's contributions live so

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,680
this process is

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,520
put in place in order to help us track

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,400
and be aware

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,040
of the enterprise's contributions to the

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
open source

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,320
community all right so

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
real quickly again this is supposed to

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,040
be a case study a demo

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,359
talk so again here's our live

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,960
github uh community that we share for

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,560
for everybody to see um there's a github

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,839
link right up here where you can go get

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,240
the code for this site this is the

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
docusource site so you can take our site

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
and

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
and modify it and use it for your

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,480
organization if you like

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,599
but what happens with that api that runs

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,079
every night that we just got through

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,280
talking about is it produces

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,720
two files and those files are json files

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,000
and they're automatically checked into

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,119
our public project

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,720
every night and this is how we share

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,680
with the world all the work we're doing

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,119
so

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,280
this is our public community

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,119
contributions file so you can see

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,920
these are all of the communities that we

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,200
have contributed code to

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,960
and you can see some projects are

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,960
approved but don't yet have

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
contributions other projects are

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,880
approved and have contributions so

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,200
you can see eric has done two pull

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,680
requests to this particular

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,880
open source project you know there's

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,119
elasticsearch you might

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,760
recom you might recognize or doc or the

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,680
actual docusource

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,280
but there's over there's over 100 of

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,839
these i think the last count was

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,960
somewhere in the 130 range

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,240
of projects that we've approved for open

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
source contribution

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,359
and then of course all the links here

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,720
you can actually drill down and see

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,480
amy's specific contribution if you want

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,720
if you want to see what that what that

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,320
is and these are just listed in

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,119
alphabetical order so if you scroll down

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
a little bit further

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,640
you can start to see all of the optum

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,480
projects that we have um

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
published and there's optum barista you

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
know the tool we were talking about and

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,119
you can see

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,400
all the people um several of these

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
people are internal

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
folks so you know there's me and there's

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,280
one of my teammates ben and there's

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,160
randy who's been helping me with this

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,520
presentation

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,520
but then there's some other people here

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,480
who were either students or outside

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,040
contributors

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,240
that have helped us make barista better

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,480
and again the api

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,839
builds and pulls all this stuff for you

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
so hopefully maybe you can make use of

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,520
that

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,680
the other interesting page in our

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,119
open source site is our engineering page

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,560
so these are all the people and it just

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
kind of looks at this data from a

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,960
different perspective

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,640
so this list lists all the people and

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,560
all the different projects they've

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,760
given to so all of these are upstream

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,320
engineers within

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,880
optimum or uhg we pull their public

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,440
profiles the api does all that

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,200
and it builds this cool little little

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,040
page dynamically

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,800
and you can see the the projects that

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,839
people contributed to so pradeep over

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,079
here has given

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,760
you know 83 pull requests um to this

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,359
particular optum project

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,520
um and then you've got amy down here

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,720
that i'm called out before she's one of

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,119
our most prolific

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,560
open source folks and you know the box

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
that it builds for her is so long and i

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,240
have to scroll several pages just to get

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,599
just to get down to it and then if you

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,119
see somebody without

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,400
any contributions it just means they've

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,560
taken the class and they've been

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,119
approved but they haven't

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
done any contributions yet so this is

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,280
our way of kind of recognizing our

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,440
people and

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
sharing with the world the public work

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,200
we're doing

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,960
um i wanted to point out and i'll pull

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,240
it over here and share with you

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,400
so um

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,040
if you go to our our github

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
organization for optum um you know

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
there's the link that takes you directly

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,200
to that

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,599
site i was just showing you um and then

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,640
here is the github repository

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,920
for that site so again if you want to

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,400
play with this api

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,680
if you want to take it and use it help

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
us make it better

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,599
you know submit issues or whatnot it's

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
all out here it's all open source

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,880
you're welcome to to do that and we

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,000
encourage you to do that right we want

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,240
to make this

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,320
easier for for other folks as well so

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,440
i think we're down to like the last five

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,800
minutes um

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,240
we've got a couple other things we can

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
talk about but i want to make sure we

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,160
leave some time for for questions

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,960
if anybody's got any questions if you

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,240
want to enter them in the q a tool or or

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
in the chat

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,079
um randy and i'll be glad to to try to

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,000
answer those

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,040
yeah any questions about deploying it or

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,119
trying it out

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,240
we'd really love it people tried it and

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,280
gave us some feedback

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,079
it's uh like we said before available at

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,880
github

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,440
go pull the code fire up some docker

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,079
images

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,400
and you're off and running

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,520
i will also add since there's no

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,359
questions yet

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,720
um we had to

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,760
put in capability for the process or the

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,560
project

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
to handle both internal github

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,119
repositories and public github

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
repositories

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,560
so it does manage to have credentials to

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,200
both and it's

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,960
able to work across those boundaries

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,800
which was not trivial but turned out as

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,720
an enterprise that was pretty necessary

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,720
because we have components that are in

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,480
the public sphere and we have

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,520
things that we built internally that are

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,520
in our internal github

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
so kevin asks do you know how barista

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,960
compares to the oss review

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,560
tool kit um yeah so actually that's a

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,720
great question kevin because i've

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,240
uh i've evaluated that and i've been on

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,599
some of the calls i'm actually part of

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,720
the linux foundation

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,119
tooling group um that worked on ort

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
and the folks primarily open germany

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,119
that put

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,599
work together and and that's a great

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,880
question

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,680
and here's why um as we mentioned in the

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,400
beginning

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,119
we're primarily an internal organization

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
that is

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,319
that needs to be able to do things at

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,000
high volume and

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,599
in a self-service manner right so if

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
i've got a project manager

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,119
in ireland that's working on a big

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,119
project

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,240
he's only got so much time to devote to

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,599
open source governance

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,680
right and so we needed to make it as

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,400
simple as possible for him

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,359
and we believe barista lets that happen

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
um

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,400
ort is a great tool you know i've done a

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
lot of

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,880
testing with it and some other kinds of

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,680
things ort is much more designed for

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,560
someone who's

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,079
shipping software and has to be very

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,119
particular about

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,319
complying with all the rules for

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,200
shipping software let's say they're

00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,760
shipping

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,440
a linux type component maybe they're

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,359
shipping it with a device maybe they're

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,560
shipping it as part of an automobile

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,359
manufacturing um type

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,240
application and and the reason i say

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,800
that they're different

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,680
is ort is very detailed is that in our

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,240
experience

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,599
when you go through and develop a scan

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,960
in ort instead it all

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,000
set it all up and you and if you're

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,079
familiar with it you know they've got

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,319
this concept of curations and other

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,599
kinds of things

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,440
it can take a week or better to get

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,800
a scan for a relatively complex

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
application working

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,119
right that's a lot of time to devote um

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
to get it up and running and it's not

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,599
because ort is not a good tool it's a

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,520
great tool

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,079
it's just that it approaches things

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,319
differently with how it pulls code

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,119
and there's lots of ways for things to

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,000
go wrong

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,720
and so our engineers for our internal

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
uses

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,000
they're just not going to devote that

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,800
kind of time to it the other issue is

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,359
that ort

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,440
isn't really designed to collate all the

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,839
information it finds into a central

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,119
database or into a central repository i

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,720
imagine you could do it

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,480
if you were willing to figure out a way

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,000
to deploy it that way but that's by

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
default that's not how it's set up to

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,960
work it's more

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,680
set up to be a distributed effort where

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,000
a particular project team scans their

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,720
code so it just two different approaches

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,079
to the same problem you know i would

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,880
suggest that if you're

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,160
shipping software to customers

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,040
especially in countries like the

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,240
european

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,160
the european union where there's some

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,920
very stringent intellectual property

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,520
rules

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,560
and you can devote a large amount of

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,040
time to getting it exactly right

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,079
ort may be the way to go barista is

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,040
really good

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,400
when you're primarily concerned with all

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,839
this software that we're pulling into

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,359
our organization that we're using for

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,640
internal projects to make sure that

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,839
we're recognizing

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,480
copyright holders rights and we're not

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,000
making any big mistakes

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,680
it's a much more self-service kind of

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
approach it's much quicker to get up and

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,880
running for any given project team

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,400
i hope that answers your question i can

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,359
talk at length about the differences but

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,920
that's a great

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,920
great question

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,440
let's see i think we got one one one

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
minute left

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,480
i hope some of this is has been helpful

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,280
to folks um again please share with

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,800
folks because

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,079
uh you know just selfishly we'd like to

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
get more people involved with any of

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
these projects whether it's our

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,640
contribution api

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:31,760
barista we would really like to

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,760
to have folks contribute help us make it

00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,359
