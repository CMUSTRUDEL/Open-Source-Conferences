Description: 
	Presented by: Terrence Pugh, NSA
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: One of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption of an application is user familiarity. If users don’t know how to take advantage of all the features of your application, they might stop using it entirely! But what if the users could simply and easily train themselves – and have fun, too?

In this talk, Terrence will introduce SkillTree, an open source solution for gamifying user training. SkillTree creates a rewards system that awards users skill points for executing defined actions in your application. It can be easily integrated into an existing application and quickly configured by the development team. In early deployments, SkillTree has dramatically increased user engagement and utilization of application features and generated significant cost savings over traditional training methods.

hello everyone

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,000
and welcome to the national security

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,599
agency skill tree talk

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,759
and this is gamification made easy

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,279
so today i first want to start off by

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,400
just going over a little bit about

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
myself

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
i've been a software engineer at the

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
national security agency going on

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
about six years now and there i actually

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
serve

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
under the development experience which

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
we like to call devx

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,519
effort and under there i am the team

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
lead for the uh

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
for the ecosystem team and so there all

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
of our products and services are

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
centered around making the lives of

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
developers easier

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,000
we want to make sure that their

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
experience internally at the agency is

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
the same or as close of a of an

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
experience as they would have

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,640
externally at home developing one of uh

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,239
the other great uh opportunities we have

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
there under the ecosystem team is we

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,199
support the open source software center

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
and there we help shepherd the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,800
developers and projects through the open

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,000
source process so all the fun

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,239
legal and policy questions that arrive

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
and all the processes putting things

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
actually that

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
all the things that it takes to actually

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
get our on that software

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
open source and within get in our github

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
repos are

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
we help shepard them through that

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
process

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,159
so outline for today we'll briefly go

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
over what gamification is

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
then we'll dive into what skill tree is

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
and we'll provide

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,520
our architecture of how the service

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
actually works then we'll go into

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,960
the skill tree demo and then of course

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
we'll also want to

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
let you know how uh how you can also

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
contribute

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
so gamification so when you think about

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
gamification there are

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,640
two and now three with this conference

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,119
that can probably come to mind

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
uh yelp stack exchange if you've ever

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,479
answered questions on stack exchange you

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
get points you get badges

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,759
with yelp if you leave reviews you you

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
get points you

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
there's different tiers and levels of of

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
experience and

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,960
when you have more levels you have

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
people tend to weigh your comments or

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
your feedback uh heavier

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
and even with this conference uh if you

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,440
visit the booths

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
you'll be able to actually get uh get uh

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
points and you go up within the

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
leaderboard and then hopefully receive

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
prizes so when you think about

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,959
gamification

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
that's a good example so when we when

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,879
you're using skill tree we're

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
enabling developers to be able to easily

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
integrate

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
gamification features into their web

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
application to encourage

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
engagement and there are a lot of great

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
benefits when we see

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,360
this service integrated with web

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,160
applications

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
so benefits of skill tree when when

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,959
users

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
or when developers integrate this

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,680
service into the applications we've seen

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
more traffic

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
um cost the the big things for lowering

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
costs

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
as geared around training a lot of and

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
us personally a lot of our applications

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
are

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
very feature rich and dense and we can

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
look at

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,959
user traffic and usability um metrics

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
and we can see that

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
hey there's uh these hundred features

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,319
and

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,319
users are really only using these 10 or

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,879
20 and it's not really saying that these

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
other

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
features on those applications aren't

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
helpful or beneficial

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
it's just that they haven't made their

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
way to be able to really taken the time

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,840
to master those so we see

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,560
lower calls and within training and so

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,239
with a lot of these tools you might have

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
a subject matter expert come

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,000
and help train uh users on how to uh

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
to really get the full benefit of what

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,400
these applications have to offer

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,159
so when you integrate skill tree you you

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
can still have that training but even

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
when that

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
training is not available users are

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,040
still encouraged to really explore these

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
applications and

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
you can use skill tree to really map out

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,720
and encourage

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
use across the application and then as a

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
result of that you just

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
really have more skilled users and with

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
more skilled users you're getting less

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
questions

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
from a project standpoint

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,720
so skill tree out of the box it gives

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
you the skill and ranking visualizations

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
that you'll see soon

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
they're beautiful in my opinion the team

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,360
did a really really great job with that

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,799
and even for um the way developers were

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
integrated into their applications

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,280
there's reporters

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,040
on action so the user clicks a button um

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
it triggers and sends it up to the skill

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
tree service and then it's reporting to

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
this beautiful dashboard so out of the

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,320
box developers are able to use vue.js

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,280
react angular and just plain javascript

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,160
and we really

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
know that that's a very wide variety so

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
that's when we say we feel as though

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
it's

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
really easy to integrate with just about

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,080
any web application that's one of the

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
main reasons why

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,400
so uh skill tree um

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
with uh this is the dashboard where you

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
can actually

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
go in and even if you're not a developer

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,120
you can go in and you can actually map

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
out the achievements

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
the levels the skills and badges through

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
this dashboard application

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,919
and so even if you're not even if you're

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
not a developer from a project

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,440
from a project manager standpoint you

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,360
don't have to go into terminal or you

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,919
don't have to write code to really map

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
out

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
and add um the features or the the

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
badges and the skills and the levels

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,680
that you would want the

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
end users to be able to go in and

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
achieve so

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
you can have the developers uh stand up

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
the instance and we'll see in a demo

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,759
how easy that is and as a product owner

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,080
or

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
a project admin you can go in and map

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
out you know where you want the users to

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
be able to interact

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
and and provide incentives for those to

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
be um used

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
and so um from the user standpoint uh

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
this is

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
the view that you would easily be able

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
to to see within your web application

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
and it's really like a portal that you

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
they'll click a button and then this

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
will come down within the web

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
application

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
and they can just get a status on where

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,600
they are within um

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
within their ranking for that

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
application

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,639
all right and the architecture so this

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,080
is a high-level view at how a skill the

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
skill tree service is laid out

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
you have the dashboard where the project

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
admins or

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
um managers can really interact with

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
it's it's uh

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
no need to know how to code or develop

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
from the dashboards dashboard standard

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
view well point of view

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
then of course we have the skill service

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
that really communicates between the

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,759
storage

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
and the reporters that you see on the

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
right where we uh

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,280
developers use to integrate with that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
service and so this is really a high

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,639
level view and so when we go through the

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
demo try to keep kind of picture this in

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
your head you have the dashboard you

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
have the skill service

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
that communicates with all portions and

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
to the right we have our reporters which

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
is where you'll see on the client in

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,600
where

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,199
developers can easily install install

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,800
the client and have those reporting

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
events sent to the skills service

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
all right and now we are going to the

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
demo

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
all right so for prerequisites uh we uh

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
there are only about uh there's only

00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
four

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,880
uh key ones that you need to get started

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,639
to run the service and the dashboard and

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,160
the skill service is actually in

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,919
inside of docker hub so with just uh one

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
simple command you can you can pull

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,840
and get that your uh your skill tree

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:20,880
dashboard up and running

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,800
so right now we are we've visited docker

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
hub and now we're doing our docker run

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
command

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
and so now we should be able to view our

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
skill tree dashboard that we saw an

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
image of before

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,840
and the development team really made

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
they really kept uh developers in mind

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
so when management hears about skill

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
tree and they say hey can we integrate

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,960
this into our application

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,400
we they developers can really go out and

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,000
and get this up and going and seeing

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,199
really what the level of effort is to

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
integrate into the application

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
so we'll um so when you run that uh that

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,199
docker container um

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
this it'll prompt you when you visit the

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,039
site to just

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,039
enter in a root account

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:17,100
looking for that strong password

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,100
[Music]

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,919
and with that docker hub pull and run we

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,640
have our dashboard up

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,519
and so this is the uh the view you will

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,479
have from

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
a root user

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
and you can see how the how the

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,000
dashboard is laid out similar to the

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
image you saw in the slides so we have

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
our dashboard up so the next thing we

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,680
want to do is start our authentication

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
endpoint

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
and the team provides a jar within the

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
repo where

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
you can easily just do a java jar and

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,839
then it'll it'll run that service and so

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,240
you get that authentication endpoint

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
it integrates it adds in sample data to

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,640
your um to the dashboard

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,640
and then it also creates a user a

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
project admin user or a demo user for

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
this uh for this use case

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,240
and so now we'll run this service and

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
then we'll have

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
the authentication endpoint which is

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
needed for the

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,680
client the clients that will have the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,160
triggers that report back to the service

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,440
this is going to enable that to to work

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,800
so um through running that we get this

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
uh

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,160
this project admin account and then

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
we'll see all the sample data

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,279
now that's populated within here so

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,959
then movies you can think of movies that

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
would be of your website and then

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,160
the different subjects are different

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,680
features of your website

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,839
so we can see the badges we can have

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,839
here that users can earn

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
and so now uh you're not a developer but

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
you want to create

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,440
you kind of want to start creating

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
things to the dashboard you can easily

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
do

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
start adding your project name to the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
dashboard so we'll see how easy that is

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
here

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,320
it's done hit save all right and so you

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,920
can see now below our sample project

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
and then the movies above that project

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
which is generated through the service

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
that the skill tree team provides to get

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,120
developers up

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,399
and going so within the dashboard you

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,399
can still see

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
uh your your personal different level

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
certain things are locked until you meet

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,839
certain thresholds and you can

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,839
map all that out through the dashboard

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,200
[Music]

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
and so for each subject you have manage

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
options here

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
and so you can really go in deep and see

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,800
and manage

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
each each skill and you can set the time

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,600
so

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,959
sometimes you can have award points for

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
people visiting the site but you don't

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
want

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
them to keep receiving points for

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,480
visiting multiple times in the same hour

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
or same day so you can set all those

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
thresholds

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
and then you can also see the level from

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,160
the project admin view you can see

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
the users as well and you could and then

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,000
what every management

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
uh loves and which how you can justify

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,279
uh

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
things is is metrics so skill tree team

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
has done a great job of integrating the

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,680
metrics into the application

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,839
you can export or download those um

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
those different metrics and so that

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
really paints a view of

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
okay what parts of the application are

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
underutilized and then you can start to

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
create badges to have more incentives on

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
those portions

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,200
and so similar to how we created the

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
project we're going to create a badge

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,839
right now

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
so like we said the team made it easy to

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
where you don't have to go and

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
and put in a request or ask a developer

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
to do this you can create the badges on

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
your own

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,279
so we've really seen it some of the um

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
very very feature rich

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,639
applications you can have with the one

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
subject matter expert kind of come in

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
and map out what's a good progression

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
for those badges as well

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
and another great feature is you have

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,639
dependencies so you can have one

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
um one function depend on another in

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,680
order to receive an achievement

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,639
and then you can also have cross project

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
um skills so

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
say there's two applications that are

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,839
totally separate but they are tightly

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
coupled in some form of way

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,680
similar to like what analysts might use

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
you can have skills depend on each other

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,440
across

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
projects which is awesome

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
and then from a product standpoint you

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,440
can also have the you can also have

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
some access management features here

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
to be able to get your admin stuff done

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
all right so now that was really from

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,160
the project admin and dashboard

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
standpoint but now we want to look at

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,959
how developers integrate this with their

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
application

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,399
so we're in npm you can easily do a npm

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
install

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
and so the out of the box all the out of

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
box javascript

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
offerings we have the team has has great

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,560
examples

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,320
provided here so we're going to look

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,600
look at uh the vue.js example and so

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
should be highlighting here the

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
configuration the import and

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,440
configuration on how

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,040
to uh communicate with that that

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,639
authentication endpoint that we

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,680
service that we set up a few steps back

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
and so how do we insert those um those

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
triggers so

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
we'll um see here we're going to

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,120
eventually see

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
how to um how to when a user clicks a

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
certain button

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,199
that action is triggered back into the

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,639
skill tree service to show like hey that

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,839
this person reported it's going to

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
report the event and that

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
that that user has completed that action

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,800
and so we see here

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,320
our report skills using the js utility

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,920
you can use directors as well but this

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,920
example is highlighting the js utility

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,760
so we're going to run this application

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,839
so um just in

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,000
summary we've set up the dashboard we

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
set up the the skills service

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,279
and now this portion is showing how

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
developers with those services

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,279
stood up how they can integrate it with

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,079
their application so we did that npm

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,760
install

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,600
we followed the examples that the

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
developers offered

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,279
and from there we can easily say hey

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
let's just do a quick test if a user

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
comes in

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,560
and clicks that button can we report it

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,639
saying they they received that skill

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,040
or that that they achieve that that

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,600
action so here this is where you're

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
tracking you're tracking what you've

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,880
done

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,079
and then we should be scrolling down and

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,079
seeing that button that we just

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
highlighted

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
so you see the directive on the left and

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,120
then below that on that code was the

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
report skill

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
with uh jsutil and we see that was a

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480
success there

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
so clicking that button those components

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
there that's sending that
