	Presented by: Ricardo Ferreira, Elastic
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Databases Track

Abstract: Since Pac-Man was originally released in the ’80s, it has been a beacon of fun and joy for people of all ages. What few people know is that this game can also be used to inspire developers on how to build streaming data applications. In this near-zero-slides talk, attendees will get to play the game to generate events. As they play, the presenter will write from scratch a scoreboard using ksqlDB — an open-source streaming database built for Apache Kafka. After building the scoreboard, it will be discussed the different strategies to send the generated scoreboard to ElasticSearch and Kibana — where the real action actually happens.
