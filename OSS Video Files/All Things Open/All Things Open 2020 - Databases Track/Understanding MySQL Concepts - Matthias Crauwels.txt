Abstract: MySQL is the largest open-source database in the world. I will guide you through the basic concepts from architecture to replication and installation of the product. We'll discuss features and we'll go into some details about what we experience as the strong points and what are the weaknesses. I will focus on the latest release of MySQL Community Edition, version 8.0,  but we'll go into some of the differences with popular forks such as MariaDB and Percona Server.
