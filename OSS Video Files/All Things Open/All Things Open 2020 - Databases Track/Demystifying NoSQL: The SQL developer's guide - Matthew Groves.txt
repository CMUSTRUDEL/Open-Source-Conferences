Abstract: We’ve been using relational databases like SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle for a long time. Tables are practically ingrained into our thought processes. But many organizations and businesses are turning to NoSQL options to solve problems of scale, performance, and flexibility. What is a long-time relational database-using developer supposed to do? Do I just forget about all that SQL that I learned? (Spoiler alert: NO). Come to this session with all your burning questions about data modeling, transactions, schema, migration, how to get started, and more. Let’s find out if a NoSQL tool like Couchbase, CosmosDb, Mongo, etc, is the right fit for your next project.
