Abstract: Postgres is moving beyond it's olden days of being a stodgy relational database. Once upon a time SQL was doomed and relational databases were going to give way to more modern NoSQL data stores. Fast forward to today and Postgres has rich document support with JSONB, has full text search support, geospatial support, and even more. We'll take a look at where it came from, and what's in the box today. 

It'll be a whirlwind tour of all the shiny features that make it an ever more loved database.
