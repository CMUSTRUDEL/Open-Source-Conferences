yeah i'm

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,599
so happy to to tell you a bit about uh

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
what it uh what it is like to build a

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,759
machine learning company around an open

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,240
source product

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,480
project and yeah i will illustrate this

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
a bit on the journey of deep set so i'm

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
happy to introduce a bit to deep set and

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
also then to

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,760
introduce you to a few let's say

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
concepts and core learnings we made uh

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
on on our journey so far briefly about

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
myself my name is milos i'm one of the

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
co-founders of deepset

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,239
um exactly and i think not

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,680
much more needed with regards to that so

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
let me let me

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
start right away with our journey that

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
started in june

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,680
2018 we found a deep set back then with

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
the mission to

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
actually find the most valuable and

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
scalable way to bring natural language

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
processing to the enterprise

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,199
who are we this was uh myself and two

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,960
other co-founders who knew each other

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,039
for quite some years all of us with a

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,719
background in

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
mathematics and computer science

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
actually so this is an aspect we'll

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,559
touch upon later in the presentation

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
again

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,600
when we talk a bit about the the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,799
different variations of

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,600
of machine learning and

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
we were quite convinced at that point in

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
time that

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
natural language processing as a

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,479
discipline of machine learning

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,360
is going to take off is going to make a

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,960
big leap and

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,560
is also going to then be let's say ready

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
for the mainstream adoption uh

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
um i want to take the opportunity to

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
briefly frame a little bit uh the whole

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
space we're in because i was now

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
throwing around some terms like machine

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
learning and natural language processing

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
just very briefly the whole big spectrum

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
we talk about is artificial intelligence

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
i would say

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
a term that is not very well defined

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
today we refer often to it for with

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
with regards to general artificial

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,439
intelligence what we mean is affect

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
anything that is somehow

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,240
human behavior that is let's say

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
mimicked by a by a computer and i think

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
i do not need to tell anyone that this

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
doesn't need to be or or rarely has to

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
do with true intelligence but maybe

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
rather also with

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
rule-based systems or things like this

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,080
machine learning as a discipline

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
is in fact the paradigm of building

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
machines and defining rules this means

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,120
we do not

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
explicitly program every rule anymore so

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
we do not need to define them

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
we can train models so we take data and

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,640
put the data into an algorithm and the

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,959
algorithm then

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
if you want to say so implicitly find

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
the rules and this is

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
and this is how we then can build

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,840
different systems for example for

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
predictions or for classification

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
and once up discipline of that is deep

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,519
learning and deep learning is

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
um as okay if you want to say so can be

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
distinguished in

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,080
machine vision mainly and in natural

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
language processing so

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,200
everything that is very high

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
high dimensional and highly context

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
specific

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
for that we usually use deep learning

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,360
and to give a brief

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,879
distinction here also what is machine

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,560
learning what is deep learning

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,400
machine learning is um is um

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
so it's it's mainly about the main

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
architecture um

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
from machine learning which are

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
artificial neural networks

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
you see them here how they were used in

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,920
the machine learning sense so pretty

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
let's say small only few parameters and

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
few layers

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
and what happened in deep learning is we

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,519
were able to

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
through the increase of compute power

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480
through cheaper computing through more

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
data also

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,799
we were able to actually make these

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
networks deeper so we could add

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
more and more layers what enables us

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
again to learn

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,440
more and more complex relations in data

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,760
and

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,280
again to make to make to make the loop

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
to natural language processing if you

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
think about language which is highly

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
context specific

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
where words have different meaning

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
depending on where they appear

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
it makes sense to have something that

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
can really capture the whole variety and

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,599
this is why

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
the deep neural networks and deep

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,560
learning is in fact um the

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,280
the field of of of science um we are in

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
here and when we talk about nlp

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
and yeah as mentioned in 2018 we founded

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
the company mainly on the hypothesis

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
that

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
this deep learning base natural language

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
processing is going to see a big leap

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
we're expecting some

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,439
shifts and model architectures and ways

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
of training those so that they become

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,959
better performing and it was great to

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
see that by the end of 2018 actually

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
our hypothesis somewhat became true back

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
then google research

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
published a paper and open sourced also

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
the source code

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
for an algorithm called bird and burked

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
as

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
probably you guys came upon it if not

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
maybe the term transformers is familiar

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,600
to you because

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
it's the same name of in fact the most

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
popular nlp library out there which is

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,680
hiding phase transformers

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,919
and these transformers were

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
very new kind of deep learning based

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,520
models and they had a lot of

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
let's say semantic capturing they were

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,600
very powerful you see here

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,120
what what leap they cost in the end um

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,840
through their release for question

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,919
answering which is one of the most

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,440
popular and most powerful also

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,360
tasks you can perform with natural

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
language processing so this was really

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
clear okay

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,639
nlp now had his magical moment and it

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,360
becomes now more practical we can use

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,919
very powerful models we can really bring

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
this

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,800
this whole idea of of language

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
understanding to machines this is

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,840
something that is now

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,199
way way more possible than it was before

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
so we threw ourselves after that

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
opportunity and said okay

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
let's let's learn what it is what people

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
want to do with natural language

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,639
processing so what are use cases they

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
want to capture so

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,240
we um we we used open source

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
technologies as mentioned bird was open

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
source

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
and there was then the transformers

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,759
library the great library which is

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
which was evolving at that point in time

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
where we were contributing and also

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
using stuff

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,199
and we worked with quite big enterprise

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
customers at that time and we're seeing

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,919
okay what are the requirements what is

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
use cases they have in mind

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,400
what do they need in the end also for

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,840
such a technology to really adopt it and

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
really let's say

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
pull it over to the mainstream and we

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
identified um

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
we identify in 2019 that search

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,000
information retrieval is

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,759
on the one hand one core task and one

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
solution to the core problems of those

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
enterprises and on the other hand it was

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
something

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,800
that worked very well with um with these

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,400
new transformer architectures

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
so it was clear that we want to throw

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
ourselves after that opportunity

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
and this is why we then built a product

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,600
around search based on these transformer

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
architectures

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
and the product is at the core open

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,080
source it's um

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,560
it's um it's it's haystack what haystack

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,520
does is it utilizes these transformer

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
models these birds and all the others

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
and

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
it's it's um it's integrated with

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
adjacent technologies that are needed

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,600
focuses on scale and production so

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
really that you can use it in

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
real world practical setting and it's

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,199
also targeted

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,440
to an audience that is not an nlp

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199
researcher or an nlp expert who can

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
really go down to every parameter but

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,160
rather someone

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
who wants to use it and who wants to

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,120
package it maybe

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,880
into into an own product and of course

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
it's an open source product um but i

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
will talk a bit more about um

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
about uh about about this in a minute

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
and what is also the rational for

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,560
for for doing that um i'm also happy to

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,360
very briefly show you um

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
what is something you can now build with

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
haystacks so what kind of

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,400
search information retrieval is possible

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,319
um here are like some documents from

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,919
from from it security so

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,440
mainly newspapers let's say we're

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
interested in ransomware we're

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,919
interested in

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,440
wannacry we can ask something like how

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,039
many machines were

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,880
affected by wannacry

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
yeah this was like this big ransomware

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,639
in 2017

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
and you see we get here the exact

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
answers uh

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,520
um here it's written computers so this

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,960
is what i mean with semantic

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
understanding semantic search the

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,440
machine interprets the question and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
understands that

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
we mean with machine computer here and

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,080
this is then why we get

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,879
these answers um

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
exactly i would leave it actually i

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
would

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,039
leave it with that and go back to

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,479
the presentation also of course time

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
because i do not want to take the time

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,319
from

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,840
the presenters after me um exactly so

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
this is what haystack does

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
we'll talk about in a minute also um

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,199
about a little bit more stuff but

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
important our journey

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,680
is is heavily driven by open source in

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,720
fact in the beginning mainly

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,599
contributing and

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
using open source um products like for

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
example spacey like the transformers

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
libraries

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,719
and we moved to also becoming authors

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,159
and maintainers of own projects like

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
haystack we also have another project

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,360
which is farm and also on the business

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
model side when we talk about the

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
company

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
we started off in the beginning of

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,800
course through a lot of support and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
services around existing open source

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
software

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,360
and moved now to offering complementary

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
sas

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
products around around the open source

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
product but i will mention this also in

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,399
a minute

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,279
a bit more detail so much from our

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
journey

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,720
and i mean there are three core elements

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
i would like to touch briefly

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
upon um when when we think about okay we

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
do

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
machine learning and the product is open

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
source

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
um what is what is what are the core

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,320
elements of such a company then

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
um and i think it's very hard to say

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,040
that these are the core elements and i

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
also want to say that each of these

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,279
elements can probably be

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
examined in way more detail especially

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
when talking about culture

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,440
but i briefly want to go into the

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,640
motivation the cultural part and also

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
give a bit of glimpse of

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
a mental model and ideas on how to

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
approach the question of a good business

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
model

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
for an open source company

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,040
when we look at the motivation

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
i would say the very bold statement we

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,279
want to make here right away is

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,720
in fact there is no other way to really

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
be meaningful in nlp

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
without being open source nlp is in the

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
end

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
something that powers products and it

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
empowers

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
it should empower people who build

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,839
products to

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,760
ma to embed natural language processing

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,160
to embed search into the products this

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
means

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
it must be developer centric and it must

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
be transparent what's

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
in there and it must also be somewhat

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
tailorable so people need to be able to

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,399
work with it

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
and to go really down to the details um

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,600
when when making it part of their

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
products

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
this is one thing it's not an end use

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
application it's not a nothing that is

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
ui driven or whatever it is really

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
something that empowers other products

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,920
and

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
can really be a product for itself at

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,200
least when we think about end user

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,800
applications

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,880
the second thing is um developers are

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,079
really key decision makers in

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
enterprises

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,839
and i know that this is quite a

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,000
controversial discussion i guess because

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,959
many many proprietary software providers

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
would argue that

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,560
no you cannot do anything without the

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
budget and developers do not have budget

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,079
but what we realized is that

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,600
the budgets are there right i mean

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
there's a lot of stuff going on out

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
there

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
companies and enterprises need to adopt

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,640
technology they need to make the next

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
step if it's natural language processing

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,519
if it's machine learning in general or

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
if it's any other technology that is out

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
there

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,120
there is no way to do that and often the

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
people who hold the budget are not the

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,720
ones who can really clearly evaluate

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
the technologies right um we always say

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
like if

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,480
if you have a developer or a technical

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,000
buyer in a room you just need to get his

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
knot if he shakes the head

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
you're you're gone and you can wind and

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
dine as much as you want with the key

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
decision maker here with the budget

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
holder in that case

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
you're not going to make the enterprise

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,279
adopt your solution your technology

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,519
so it's really at the core to um to to

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,279
address also developers and developers

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,040
value open source for multiple reasons

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
of course um

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
you you are also you should also do

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
vendor agnostic of course

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
um but yeah first first and foremost

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,240
it's a quality sign it's a quality sign

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
if you have a big community

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,760
and it's also valuable to them to look

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
into the product and this is

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,120
let's say the trust you need in the end

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
to really make the enterprise adopt

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,360
one special thing in machine learning

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,120
and especially in natural language

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
processing is that

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
so machine learning as a discipline is

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,600
somewhat hybrid

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,480
between let's say computer science and

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
really if you want to say so

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
mathematically influenced and so for

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,880
example my background is actually

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
mathematics i i would say i'm i'm better

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
on the modeling side than on the

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
software engineering side

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,880
um so the discipline is quite hybrid and

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,839
this means

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,360
that um the that a lot of

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,720
research is is

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,519
done and the research is also quite

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
cheap

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,320
because if you think about if you think

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,959
about a pharmaceutical

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
or if a vaccine costs billions and then

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,560
the companies after they spend these

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
billions they want of course to

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
have the right to to to get a patent on

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
that and to to

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
to get the commercial benefit from it

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,639
for 20 years that's not the case and

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,680
everything that's maps right maths is

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
something it's like it

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
comes from the brain there are a lot of

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
smart people out there and it's it's

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
most meaningful to leave your footprint

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
if you really share it

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
with others um and that's the reason why

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
we're

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,240
our discipline and the state of the art

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
is heavily research driven

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
also from universities but also from

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
large corporates this means that at the

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,639
core the algorithms and the models

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
are not proprietary it's it's out there

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
people can look into birth

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,079
the moment it was out there of course it

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,600
was like a bit hacky code maybe so it

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
wasn't really put into a framework

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,920
and there were transformers and hugging

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
face who gave that a bit more shape and

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
all of that stuff but

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,399
the core logic is out there so you

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
cannot you cannot

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
go beyond that this means if you want to

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
utilize this

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
in something like a framework again it's

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,760
like most natural to be

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
open source as well because people are

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
used to looking into that stuff

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
and last aspect here lasts probably for

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
all products but i feel machine learning

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,399
where the market is

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,560
really right now in this phase of

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,639
forming and shaping up it's really like

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
at the core i'm getting immediate

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,880
feedback to understand

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
and to develop product for to product

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,240
market fit

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,079
and i remember like when i started in

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
the industry five years ago

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
it was a lot about okay how is this ai

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
market machine learning market going to

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
look like actually how are we going to

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
consume and use that

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,160
and there wasn't really let's say a

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,560
clear

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,079
understanding what people need how

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
people want to interact with it are

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
people building

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
building it into their products or will

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,399
people be um

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,360
bm will people be consuming

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,800
it via api whatever and open source was

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,040
actually a good way to understand

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,120
um understand understand that you have a

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,120
community people use that stuff

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,880
you get a lot of small issues but you

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,000
also get big directions yeah you

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,079
understand what is

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,519
blocking them from using it what is what

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
is needed to bring it into production

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
all of that stuff and this is

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,720
this iteration speed in the end is

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,279
something you

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
cannot ensure if you're not open source

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
so these are like

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
i would say four core aspects again the

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,720
list can be endlessly long

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,560
um but um but i tried somehow to

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,279
condense it into those four

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
um let me jump over to the culture part

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,880
and here

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
as as mentioned i think the impact of

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
being open source as a company is way

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
bigger than what i'm presenting now i

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
just take really like let's say the most

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,639
haptic example i could

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,279
i could somehow define and find here um

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
but um but i think it's it's open source

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,600
is really like it's it's

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
it's more than that uh um it's it's an

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
openness

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,240
in in every decision you make also as a

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,279
management team maybe

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,519
or um or as a leadership team or

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,880
um yeah as a product manager when you go

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,880
into a product direction it's a it's a

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,480
different level of transparency you

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
you you have in your organization if

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
your product is already transparent open

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,040
source

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,399
still i've chosen to focus on the topic

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,759
of customer orientation and customer

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
centricity because

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
many companies every company in fact on

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
the planet

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
focuses on that and if you if you look

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
at the top management agendas

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,759
also of old incumbent companies who are

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,040
maybe in a completely different industry

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
everyone will have this

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
on top and i think many companies are

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
struggling and especially when we think

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,519
about software

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,360
companies are often struggling in the

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
proprietary space because engineering

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
teams are decoupled

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,800
from the teams who talk to the customer

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
so sales teams will come to engineering

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,639
they will tell them hey we need that

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
feature

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
and engineering will maybe say listen

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
i'm not sure if we can deliver or

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,399
why should i deliver or i don't know i

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
never talk to the customer

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,880
you often tend to have like this gap

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
being open source means every developer

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,279
is

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,040
somehow exposed and somehow in touch

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,160
with the end user already

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,079
and this was for us for us very

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
valuable i mean we had we had customers

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
early on we contributed early on but we

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
also had early on our own projects

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,639
and all of that somehow formed into one

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,759
culture so we treat in the end our

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,199
community members if they're

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
contributors or if they raise an issue

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,120
the same as we treat our customers

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,280
and that's great to have it in the dna

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
because in case you have a paying

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,039
customer who pays you for

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
for something and the engineering team

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,360
is not

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,880
it's you know they're there they

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,760
understand it they have it they have it

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,439
there because they

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,039
they like to be there for other

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
developers in the community they like to

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,039
solve issues and to answer to slack

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
requests

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,600
so they're also quite open in the end to

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
to do this for every customer so this is

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,760
really

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
something we felt was uh was great this

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,400
this mentality of

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,360
treating everyone who uses our product

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
like a customer

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
and giving the dedication and also i

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
think one

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,080
great thing where many companies work on

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
is seeing

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,440
the customer or the user as your

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,320
teammate right in the open source

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
community

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,600
it's not just that people post issues

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,039
people contribute and people give

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,320
feedback and people spend time with your

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
product we should appreciate that of

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,200
course because

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
it's it's not natural that someone maybe

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,080
in his spare time over the weekend sits

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
there and looks into the product

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,679
and prototypes with it because this is a

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,320
valuable feedback we get

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,039
and understanding that this is that this

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
means we're

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,880
we are in one team also to a certain

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
degree we develop this together because

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
you give me insight and i maybe do some

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,640
building

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,640
this is this is really awesome stuff and

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
it really helpful also when interacting

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
with them with

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
enterprise and commercial customers who

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,720
then tend to also treat suppliers and

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,760
vendors often a bit let's say

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,200
hierarchical and this really helps to to

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,840
to uh to to keep up the good mood and to

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,000
them to really also be always have that

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,000
in yeah have it in your dna and deliver

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,039
let's talk about the business model part

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
and the business model part is something

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
i

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
really in the sense of open source i

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,679
want to give the credit right away

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,760
to the person who shaped us here and

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,120
influenced the thinking the most um

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,919
so who i'm going to pick up now um

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
joel spolsky here and his mainly his

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
strategy letter number five

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,880
i think it's almost 20 years old but

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,520
it's a

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,120
great piece of work and it really is a

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,480
mental model that

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,880
we try to fit very well also into how

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,840
we think about the business model how we

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
think about

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
commercial and commercial product what

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
we offer around it

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,679
um so this is why i'm happy to introduce

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
it here but as mentioned i just wanted

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
to

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,760
give the credit right away to joel um

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,120
so the core theory comes from from

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
microeconomics

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
and it's in fact about the idea of

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
substitutes

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,600
and complements uh probably most of you

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
know it already but i

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
still want to briefly briefly look into

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,799
that here so

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
let's say you have a product and then

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,320
yeah there's another product which is

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,799
either substituting your product or it's

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,440
complementing your product so what

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,480
happens

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,080
if it's a substitute is um the moment

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,160
you raise a price

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,520
for this product um your demand

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
goes down huh so at some some somewhat

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,799
obvious if you think about let's say

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,240
coke in the can and coke at a bottle if

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,600
the coke and the can i don't know

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,840
um is is is

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,960
becoming twice as expensive the demand

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,400
goes down

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
one important consideration to make

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,039
right away here um

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,799
because of course everything in here is

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,960
related somewhat to open source

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,960
we need to keep in mind that every

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,600
software even if it's

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
free of license with open sources comes

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,880
at a cost right so

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,880
if you if you open source something

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
there is still work involved to make it

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
work

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,960
in the end and to maintain it and all of

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
that stuff so this is really

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
really important to keep in mind um that

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,919
there is

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,919
that there still is a price that

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
that that might that might influence you

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
here and

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
um what happens uh what happens in

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
return for for the

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
for the uh for the other substitute here

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,360
of course

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
when when the when the prices go up and

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,720
the demand goes down here

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,320
the demand for this product here rises

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,840
uh of course because you have a pure

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
competition on price

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
uh so transferring this to an open

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
source world

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
yeah if i'm an open source software

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,480
provider and i try to sell

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,440
on let's say just some plain

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
enterprise license the which is not very

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,400
well defined

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,840
it might end up being in a substitute

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
situation right because

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
it's not clear what the value is i put a

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,760
increased price tag

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
on something that was out there that was

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,080
actually

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,400
not priced or if you think about making

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
some stuff more difficult i don't know

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,480
increasing the total cost of ownership

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
this is all stuff that actually leads to

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
you fighting against your own product

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,120
and cannibalizing your own product

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,039
um the more powerful thing is of course

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,360
uh think about a compliment

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,480
this means um if we have a compliment

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
now and

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
the price goes up goes down for this

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
complement

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,200
what happens is the complement will be

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,960
more used

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,200
and if the complement is more used my

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
product yeah so i'm commoditizing the

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
complement to a certain

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
degree my product will be demanded more

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,559
huh

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
so going back to the open source world

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,400
if i find a way to say okay

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
this open source product in itself it's

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
so valuable and i

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,840
i reduce the price i reduce the total

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
cost of ownership i make it even easier

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,159
yeah

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,320
so i drive adoption up i make it a

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,520
commodity everyone can use it

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
enables me also if i have if of course i

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,000
have a solid complementary product

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,120
around it yeah um

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,720
enables me to to to to get more demand

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
and more adoption also on this

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,000
complementary commercial product so

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,480
this means um the complementary idea is

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,600
in fact

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,760
the powerful idea here and what i really

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,760
like about joel is he says

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,440
in fact when you look at this theory

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,799
what you should aim for is

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,280
you should make this complement this

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,640
yeah you should make it uh you should

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,039
make it a commodity right

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
it should be easy to adopt it should be

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,400
used

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
all over the place um and if you if you

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
ensure that your

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,080
product will also receive and reach more

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
and more and more demand and open source

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,919
software or open source as a model

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,520
is something that actually drives this

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,159
commoditization of software

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,559
up right because um as i mentioned it's

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,120
it's

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,880
cheap to distribute yeah and if you put

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,039
effort in it and make it valuable for a

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,120
community that the community can also

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,400
cheaply at relatively low total cost of

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
ownership adopted

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,559
you still have a lot of place for a

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
commercial complement

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
and you still have a market so you

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
shouldn't limit yourself when you think

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
about hey

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,640
shouldn't we should we make this as easy

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
and as great as possible

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
some practical examples on substitutes

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
and complements uh

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
i think it's the idea was quite clear

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,480
but yeah

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
again if we think about bread and butter

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
maybe if if bread becomes extremely

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,440
cheap more people buy bread and if the

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,200
price for butter stays the same

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
the demand the overall demand for butter

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,400
will go up because the total cost of

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,520
ownership for the combined product

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,679
compared to the value it provides me um

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,640
is increasing and this is this is i

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,520
think a

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,080
a great way to think um in this in this

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
tangent

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,919
field of um how to commercialize open

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,000
source at the end

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,440
um machine learning as a discipline

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
i would say this is maybe bold again but

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,760
um i would say offers actually a lot of

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,120
opportunity to deliver

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,480
a very whole powerful

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,120
open source complement product and to

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,320
have like

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,080
um or an open source core product and

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
have a have a valuable complement around

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,520
it so when you look

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
at haystack for example haystack is as

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
in as

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,200
you think as an architecture it's

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,799
something that consists of building

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
blocks these building blocks fulfill

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,440
different functions

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,760
and under each building block you can

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,440
configure very powerful technologies you

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
can configure for example in a reader

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
model

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
different transformers in the document

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,960
store you can take i don't know

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
elasticsol or whatever you want

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,799
so you have a lot of a lot of choice

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
there and haystack also allows you to

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,279
easily put it together

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,360
such that you have like a robust

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,000
pipeline a scalable pipeline you can

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,279
wrap an api around it you really solve

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,880
in fact a lot of the

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,840
purely technical complexity yeah

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
what what what you still have as

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,320
opportunities and this is a bit how we

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
think about it is

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,799
um is to have like valuable valuable

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,840
um yeah supporting tooling around it

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
for example easy configuration um you

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
can

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
you can you can use the tool you can try

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
out a lot of stuff

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,080
every developer can do this but probably

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
in an enterprise setting

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,039
many developers wouldn't also love to do

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,799
that they would love to have let's say

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,240
pre-optimized pipelines or stuff like

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
that and so they

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,360
want to they want to take a bit of the

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,559
heavy lifting away or if you think about

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,760
monitoring you think really about a

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,679
large scale adoption

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
yeah the free product is great it's used

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
it's in production maybe at some point

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
in time you feel like

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,320
i may be a bit overwhelmed i need to get

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,600
more transparency on this or maybe

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,600
i don't know i need to to to to to

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,440
to know better what is uh what is going

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,120
on there should i upgrade the model

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,400
should i upgrade the model

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,640
and the last thing is also labeling a

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,480
tailoring so domain adaptation

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,400
again many special companies and

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,159
enterprises face the challenge that they

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
have a very specific language they use

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,480
for example and they want to adjust it

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,480
to this

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,520
particular language so this means this

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,080
is like really

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,120
getting even more value out of haystack

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,200
in that moment

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,279
um these are all options for valuable

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,840
complements that are somewhat orthogonal

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,640
to the

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,720
to the to the actual open source product

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,159
uh and here's an example how this is uh

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,720
this is captured for example

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
um or we think about it in in haystack

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,480
hub

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,240
for example through annotations

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
the tool actually is also available for

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
free but thinking about streamlining the

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
process

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,760
again taking a bit away heavy lifting

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,200
having all integrated in one platform

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,440
such as you can really say okay

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,799
in a complex enterprise setting this is

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
a valuable add-on

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,320
to um to to to my

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,480
normal search pipeline i could build

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,480
free of charge or as mentioned nothing

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,039
is free of charge but with

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,480
at least with the license free software

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,440
yeah um so i think i can even make it in

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,720
time which is great

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,200
um regarding uh to to sum this

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,799
briefly up maybe um so i think what you

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
should take away from this is number one

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,799
nlp made a big leap and it really seems

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,480
like we're ready to enter the mainstream

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,559
there are great companies out there

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,799
who are also supporting this from

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,080
transformers to gina ai to milvis so

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
there's a lot of

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,279
companies going on all of them open

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,679
source also um

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,399
so yeah i would say all of us are ready

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
to to

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,159
to to bring and to to to meet mainstream

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,279
markets

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
um at the core still nlp must be open

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,240
source this is strong conviction

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
and proprietary solutions is nothing we

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,360
expect to win in this market

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,200
um exactly um then maintaining open

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,120
source projects is something that

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
can be also beneficial when thinking

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,240
about the

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,919
sales organization or delivery

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,679
organization further down the road when

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,039
the companies start to commercialize

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,320
because being open source and

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,159
maintaining a project is something that

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,240
translates very well also into customer

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,840
centricity

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,679
exactly commercial open source means

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,360
looking for the complement so

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,200
aim on commoditizing the open source

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,039
product aim on reducing the total cost

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,320
of ownership for the open source product

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,679
as much as you can

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,200
and it's not going to harm um

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,720
and it's not going to limit the business

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,120
opportunity if you're very

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,159
able to find a meaningful complement and

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,320
last but not least

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,679
of course haystack is a great tool for

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,559
introducing nlp

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
into products so yeah we're very happy

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,679
if you join our community

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
or follow us on one of the channels or

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,159
mainly if you have questions or

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,000
as we're hiring right now uh also join

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,559
our team

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
at deepsea slash careers you will find

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,120
the current postings

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,640
and with that i'm happy to conclude so

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,159
thanks a lot for the attention

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,300
thank you so much i think there's one

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,359
question in the q a

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,359
[Music]

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,399
um can you see that i have to stop my

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,279
screen sharing briefly um i can

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,799
i can read it to you i see it do you

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,000
find limitations on

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,640
an open sourcing state-of-the-art

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,200
academic research when developing for a

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,720
business

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,919
um so

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,039
for us to be honest um the open sourcing

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,760
of the research is

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
it enables our business yeah because

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,000
still

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,520
even even though i said in the beginning

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,640
the the research is still relatively

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
cheap

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
it's um it's it's still something we do

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,320
not do at the at the core

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
what we research on us a lot about how

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,240
can these models be used in practice

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
uh how can we adapt them maybe to a

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,240
certain to a certain

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,080
um text corpus and so on and so forth so

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,720
for us it's rather enabling

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,320
and i think the institutions that that

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,200
open source state-of-the-art research

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,799
are often of course

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,080
also the big tech players the rationale

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,559
behind it

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,919
might be might be might be um might be

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,480
uh might be different but

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
uh probably cloud driving cloud adoption

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,880
up and stuff like this

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,120
so we think that um yeah for us as

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,440
mentioned it's it's not limiting

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,320
it's a contrary it increases trust

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,960
everything we do

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,679
in domain adaptation makes the community

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,520
more aware

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,360
of the fact that the stuff works and can

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,240
work for them and this is actually what

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
we do with

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,360
tomorrow try as mentioned to move into

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,159
mainstream market to cross the chasm so

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,559
this is uh

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,760
this is why for us we do not see any

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,640
adverse effect of

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,360
or ever see any risk of or any need to

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
actually

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,600
underscore and not disclose any any

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,120
proprietary models or anything

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,679
we learned um i hope that answers the

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,080
question

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,520
if not happy to to to take this also to

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
a chat afterwards and i see jeff also

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
has a question

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,360
to a patent as something to explore

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,200
worry about in this space

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,480
um we do not see patents um i can

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,240
well yeah so we do we realize we do know

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,039
we do not see patents i know that there

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,880
are some people who

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,279
start patenting some lp algorithms and

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
stuff but really what what we see what

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,840
is adopted

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,600
is not patented at all and we are also

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,200
not worried about it and i think the

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
reason for this is i mentioned that

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
the discipline is partly computer

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,000
science and partly maths right and

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,120
i always i always love the background

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,919
and the story of the black scholes

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,279
formula

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,799
two researchers had in fact the same

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,840
idea of solving a partial

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,519
differential equation in option pricing

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,200
at a time when there was no twitter and

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,080
where their rally were conferences and

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
stuff so

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,519
this is really like it's it's a it's a

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
thought

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,080
two persons have at the same time

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,440
because it's relatively cheap

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
to to to experiment on it uh whereas of

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,080
course i

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,600
i cannot find a vaccine against covet if

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,039
i do not spend one billion on

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
experiments and stuff and this is why i

00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,519
think

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,440
patents is something that doesn't really

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,360
and won't probably find its way

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,279
into into machine learning because as

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
mentioned gpt free the training cost was

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
10 million

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
which is high for a startup but still

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
that's something

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,440
many organizations stanford university

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,320
can afford that as well and this is

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,320
where we think

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,919
patents is nothing that would bother us

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,919
so much in our space at least

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,840
i hope that answers also the question

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,519
matt i'm also happy to take that to take

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,840
that

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,840
not offline but to another online

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
