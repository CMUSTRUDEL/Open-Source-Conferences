Title: Open Source Gives You the Edge - Rob Montalvo - DataCrunch Lab LLC - Open Source 101
Publication date: 2021-04-10
Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Rob Montalvo, Co-founder & President of DataCrunch Lab LLC delivered the talk "Open Source Gives You the Edge" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
In spite of all the benefits the cloud provides, there are still a few use cases where complete reliance on the cloud may not be adequate or desired. One of the latest trends in computing, termed “edge computing”, refers to moving the processing of data closer to where it originates. Edge computing reduces latency, improves the user experience, and enables businesses to gain better business agility. In this talk, Rob will provide a survey of different alternatives from open-source software foundations (Eclipse, Apache, Linux) which can be leveraged to implement robust, secure, scalable, and business-friendly solutions. Rob will also share his thought process in deciding which technologies DataCrunch Lab looked into to implement a Condition-Based Maintenance prototype for the Department of the US Navy.

it truly is an honor and a privilege to

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,000
be here with you today

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,360
uh before i get going on with my

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
presentation i wanted to

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,040
take a brief moment to thank todd lewis

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
and all the staff

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,680
at all things open time of three time

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
thought and company deliver an amazing a

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
great product dollar for dollar

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,119
this is the most valuable conference

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,560
that i attend every year

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
finally i just wanted to let you know

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,480
that this is my first time speaking

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,160
on all things open events i certainly

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
hope it is not the last one

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
a bit of housekeeping it is certainly my

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
intention to cover the material in the

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
presentation

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
in a way that leaves us with a few

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
minutes for q a

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,239
if i fall short on go on that goal

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
please contact us

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
at info data consulate with any

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,719
questions comments or feedback that you

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
may have

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
and we will certainly get back to you at

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,879
our earliest convenience

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,039
that said the reason why you're here

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,280
let's get started with the presentation

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,399
i titled this presentation open source

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
gives you

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,080
the edge and i did it that way for

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
several reasons

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
i wanted it to be catchy somewhat

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
enigmatic

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
i also wanted it to be ambiguous and i

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
also wanted to hint at

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,439
what i wanted to cover the edge that i

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
allude to in the title could be

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
interpreted as

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
an edge in terms of competitive

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
advantage

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,240
open source enables facilitates

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,840
certainly empowers

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,840
so in that way it could definitely give

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
you a competitive advantage

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,840
the other take on the word edge refers

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
to the iot edge

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
specifically the different pieces that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,159
could be leveraged and combined

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,479
to provide a solution to your customers

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
in upcoming slides i will cover a few

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
representative scenarios of cases where

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,040
bringing computation

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
closer to where the data originates may

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
not be

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,240
just desirable it may be necessary

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
here's what i will be covering by

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
presenting a few scenarios

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,119
i hope to build a case for edge

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
computing i will borrow words from the

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,600
linux foundation

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,479
to frame what is edge computing we will

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
look at a few

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
well-known software foundations and some

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
of the projects that you may want to

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
look into

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
to support your own projects i will

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
outline some of the criteria

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
i use to determine which combination of

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,720
components

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,360
let me get to 80 of the solution

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
finally time permitting i'll take a

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
close look at the prototype

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,680
we developed for the united states

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,680
department of the navy

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,120
well we have to do this things are

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
lawyers make us say

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
the views express on this presentation

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
constitute our best interpretation of

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
the elements outlined

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,959
well you can read the rest

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
ah as i said earlier my name is robinson

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
montalvo i go by rob

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,599
fund facts believe it or not i did learn

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
how to do sourdough bread last year

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,599
if you're looking for a way to build

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,599
your patients highly recommend them

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
so here's a little bit about their conch

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,319
lab and some of the things we do

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,080
uh because we are not here for that i

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,959
will say that

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:20,080
um i'm gonna move on to the next slide

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,879
so this is a picture of a missile

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
frigate

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,480
of the italian navy specifically the

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,799
carlo bergamini

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,519
f590 it belongs to the class of european

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,560
from

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
frame class frigates the u.s navy

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
recently commissioned fincantieri an

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,040
italian shipbuilder

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,720
to build a few of these for their fleets

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
this was actually the inspiration of the

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,400
prototype we did for the department of

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
the us navy last year

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
some of the critical components on this

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
kind of ship

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,680
are very well instrumented for the

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,799
purposes of assessing their health

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
after a certain period of time there are

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
as you might imagine all kinds of

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,400
sensors connected to the turbines

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,760
the compressors the hull even the

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,640
propeller mechanism the way things work

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,480
today is that data originating from

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,920
sensors is collected

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,200
in some cases manually and it onto a

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,400
system

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,199
onshore that aggregates and processes

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
the data

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
to extract insights and determine mains

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
maintenance needs

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,759
after the ship gets to the shore in

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,280
other words

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,960
while this ship is actually out on c

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
it is generating tons and tons of

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
information it is

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,840
monitoring different components doing

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
all kinds of different things

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,800
but the things that could be done to

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,680
help like perhaps doing maintenance

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,040
like preparing for the eventual

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,080
replacement of a

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
pump or a bearing or additional

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
maintenance

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,199
all those things have to wait until the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,880
ship gets too short

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
and this as you might have imagined has

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,560
certain implications

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
at any rate because of the nature of

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
these assets we cannot use

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,800
traditional networking approaches

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
wi-fi won't work a tethered

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,960
ethernet of course won't work either 5g

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
would not be much of use of much use

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,840
when the vessel is several miles away

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
from shore

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
i'm sure you get the picture the most

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,039
widely means

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,680
of communication in this situation is

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
satellites and it is not a feasible

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
means of transferring data for analysis

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
and processing in a public cloud

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,000
as you might have guessed the same sort

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,039
of challenges will be faced by cruise

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,720
ships

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,720
or cargo ships as the ever given

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
like in the case of a moving ship a

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
stationary offshore wind turbine would

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
have similar constraints

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,400
and would require a similar approach if

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
a condition based maintenance technology

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,080
were to be

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
developed for this kind of assets one

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
could argue that this particular

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
scenario could be addressed

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,450
by a traditional public cloud data

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
center

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,479
[Music]

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
there could be a series of advantages in

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,639
bringing the processing closer to the

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
turbines

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
this particular picture is intended to

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,000
represent the use case of a smart city

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
project

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,680
aimed at helping planning traffic

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,080
management

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
and other objectives this is one of

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,199
those where you would want to ask

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,680
do we need to count cars do we want to

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,039
double up by attempting to count people

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,479
in the vehicles

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
do we need to tell whether the same

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,000
vehicle has gone by several times

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,440
during the day certainly this is an

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
interesting scenario that could surface

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,720
concerns over privacy

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
the use behind this particular picture

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
is truly fascinating

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
duostech a company out of jacksonville

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
florida

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
built a portal aimed at visual

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,520
inspection of rail cars

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,039
and when we say visual inspection we're

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,199
talking about real-time

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
visual inspection of rail cars the

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
company claims that it can provide

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,120
real-time

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,560
detailed 360 degree imaging

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,720
at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
in the course of just a few minutes the

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,199
system generates

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
terabytes of the data transferring all

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,400
the data

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
storing it and analyzing this in the

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
public cloud might present quite a few

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,639
challenges not to mention the long-term

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
cost

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,400
of such a proposition

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
last picture here shows self-driving

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
vehicle technology

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,599
this is one of those cases where latency

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,919
is critical

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,599
the system must make real-time decisions

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,319
to effectively navigate

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
the environment while meeting all kinds

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,000
of dynamic

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,520
conditions deer crossing missing marking

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,479
drunk drivers pedestrians

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,879
you get the idea so having looked at

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
this

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
few cases and scenarios let's look at

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,879
what the linux foundation refers to as

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,000
edge computing so looking at this

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,199
definition

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,120
delivery of computing resources to the

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
extremes of a network

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
with the purpose of improving

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
performance

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,039
security cost and reliability of

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,039
applications and services

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
i recently came across a white paper

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,479
from the linux foundation

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
the title of the paper is sharpening the

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,520
edge

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
overview of the lf edge taxonomy and

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,440
framework

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
i particularly like i particularly like

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,159
this diagram

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,399
because it helps visualize edge

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
computing through the continuum of

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
physical infrastructure that comprises

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
the internet

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
from centralized data centers on the far

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
right

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,080
to the constrained device edge on the

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:56,080
far left

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
all major open source foundations have

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
projects that are being used in edge

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
computing projects

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
and we're talking about iot edge

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
projects

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
a lot of the projects originated in the

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
industry in health contributions from

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
red hat

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,320
bosch osisoft ibm

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,440
and other giants in the next few slides

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,120
i will introduce

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
some of the technologies and projects i

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
looked into

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
and experimented with in some cases

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,760
while i was considering ways for us to

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
shortcut

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839
the time and effort that it would take

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,959
to develop the prototype for the navy

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
but i alluded to earlier the projects

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
that i looked

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
into came from apache the apache

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,320
software foundation

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,519
the eclipse software foundation and the

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
linux foundation

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,200
the apache foundation has hundreds of

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
open source projects

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,040
some of the projects under the iot

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,160
category are portrayed here

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,880
a special note is apache kafka

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,320
kafka is a distributed event streaming

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
platform

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,279
and certainly because of that it could

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,399
be considered as foundational technology

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,399
for bringing data from sensors iot

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,399
sensor nodes

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,600
another component we see here is apache

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
camel which is a

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,839
an open source integration framework

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,079
based on known enterprise integration

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,800
patterns distributed database

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
apache ignite is a distributed database

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,399
for high performance computing within

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
memory speed

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,519
and uh iot db is a relatively

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,600
newcomer is a relatively new project uh

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
it is an iot native database with high

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
performance for data management and

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,000
analysis

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
deployable on the edge and the cloud

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
this particular project might be of

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
interest to people seeking alternatives

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,680
to existing time series databases

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
the last one here on the list apache

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,560
plc4x

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
is a universal protocol adapter for

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,920
industrial iot

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
it is a set of libraries for

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
communicating with industrial

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,440
programmable controllers

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,079
or plcs using a variety of protocols

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,120
while using a shared api that's clearly

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,120
one of the advantages

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
so another foundation the eclipse

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,160
foundation has

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
10 regular projects that are shown here

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
on this slide

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,880
and 25 others incubating under the

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,240
eclipse iot initiative

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
many of these projects are coming from

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
the industrial iot area they have a kind

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
of band

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,440
and are backed by european giants such

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,320
as bosch

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
uh here we see projects that deal with

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,959
uh

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,079
a digital twin or

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,000
a digital representation of the state

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,680
of a particular asset we see

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,360
projects that deal with communication

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,480
with the actual device we see mosquito

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
which is a popular

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,399
mqtt client and server or can be used

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,519
for that

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,519
and so on and so forth

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,160
um from the eclipse foundation i

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,079
particularly liked this project

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,360
because it allows us to

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,279
install a single office shell package

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
and really quickly start using the

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,360
technologies with it

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,000
within it without the time that it takes

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
to

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,839
manually integrate this so in a way

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
you can think of this as being a

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
packaged

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,210
solution for certain

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
iot projects

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,240
[Music]

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
the cloud 2h package inserts an edge

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
node

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,600
in between the cloud back end and the

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,079
iot devices

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,079
now the iot devices connect to the edge

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,800
node and the edge node connects to the

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
cloud back end

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,760
so this particular package consists of

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
four

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,880
projects eclipse honor for device

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,160
connectivity

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,920
eclipse dito or d2 for managing and

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
organizing digital representation of

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,160
physical objects

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,079
aka digital twins eclipse hockey bits

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,040
for rolling out and managing software

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,600
updates to iot devices

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,880
eclipse io fog for building and running

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,320
applications at the edge

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,240
at enterprise scale

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,839
another set of projects from the linux

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,680
foundation include

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:45,199
acryno dhx foundry

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,320
eve fledge home edge

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,680
open horizon state of the edge beetle

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,800
and secure device on board so

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,880
the linux foundation has

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,920
projects that are they usually start at

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,639
considered as at large projects and

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,440
these are

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,240
projects that are in the early stages of

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,440
being adopted by the foundation or being

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,360
promoted by by the foundation from there

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,920
they move into growth stage and

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,279
from the growth stage they mature into

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,519
the impact stage where

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,079
they're considered to be mature enough

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,880
and they have met their growth goals and

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
they are actually being adopted by the

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
industry and there is a significant

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,079
number of

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,199
use cases where the technology has

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,600
already been leveraged

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
by different people or that are being

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
considered by

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,760
for a particular solution so

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,040
at the very top we see a crano and hx

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,079
foundry and these two

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,800
projects are considered impact stage so

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,320
we're moving from the top to the bottom

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,440
the uh projects at the bottom are

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,360
in a way new

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,199
they're getting started and they're

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,279
considered at large

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,320
so beetle and security device on board

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,360
are considered

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,600
at large e the eid fletch

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,839
home edge open horizon state of the edge

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
these are all considered growth stage

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,600
and as i mentioned earlier

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,160
acronym and hx foundry are considered

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
mature

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,040
and ready for uh

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,600
for the real thing akraino is a set of

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
open

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,959
infrastructures and application

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,240
blueprints for the edge

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,240
fletch came to

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
the linux foundation as a contribution

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,759
from osisoft

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,880
one of the leaders in scada technologies

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,000
and open horizon was contributed by ipm

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,079
by ibm and it is a platform for managing

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,320
the service software lifecycle

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,440
of containerized workloads and related

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
machine learning assets

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
going back to the edgex foundry

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,320
architecture

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
this one was one of the projects that i

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,759
looked at

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,320
looked at relatively early in my

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,320
research

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,600
definitely caught my eye for several

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,199
reasons

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,440
it was very modular it was very

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,000
easy to understand how things fell in

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
place and how they talk to each other

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
it was based on microservices

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,560
architecture

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,120
so that led me to believe that

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
expanding and scale would be something

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,680
that

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:34,079
could be done relatively easily by using

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,320
something like kubernetes and

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,000
the amount of extensibility looking at

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
the very bottom in terms of

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,920
support for additional devices outside

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,240
of what they

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,600
provided by default as part of the

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,680
existing project and

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,000
community so at any rate

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,720
it is highly flexible open source

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,519
software framework that facilitates

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,279
interoperability between heterogeneous

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,079
devices and applications

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
at the iot edge along with a consistent

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
foundation for security and

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,919
manageability

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,919
regardless of the use case

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
um what else do i want to say here

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,319
okay so one of the things that uh

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
i wanted to do after having looked at

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,160
all these projects

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
was okay so what are the things that

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
really matter to me

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,240
as i try to shortcut the time that it

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,200
takes to develop that prototype

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
how quickly can i get there and will in

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
the end

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,679
after i develop the prototype would i

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,880
have

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,400
achieved the goals that i intended

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,200
that i set out to do and things that uh

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,120
uh constituted the criteria for

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
evaluation

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,160
of the different projects was the level

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
of security

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,280
as you might have guessed uh the

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,720
department of defense

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
is very keen on security we want to make

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,919
sure that

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,240
whatever is being transferred is secure

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
that it doesn't that can it cannot be

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,919
tampered with

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
that we can assure that the data came

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,080
from

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,200
a reliable source and that

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,720
eventually the data would get to us

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,200
in an integral manner clearly

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,240
when you're dealing with an asset the

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
size of a

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,120
navy ship uh we're not looking about

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,919
you know 10 sensors 50 sensors 100

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,080
sensors

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,960
you're looking actually at thousands of

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
them

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,880
and we needed to develop a platform that

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,480
would scale that would handle the the

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,480
volume of data

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
that would handle the uh

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,600
the conditions that were thrown on it

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,960
another criteria criteria that i took

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,480
into account was the extensibility

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,000
if i adopt one of the projects

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,440
if i decide to use a particular project

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,360
will i be able to contribute to it will

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
i be able to make changes to it will i

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,840
be able to

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,400
adapt it to my needs if it came to that

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,200
so in other words i needed to determine

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,000
do we have

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,120
the necessary skills in-house to be able

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,760
to augment

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,880
to be able to extend

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,480
another point of view that i

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,000
looked at was the community behind

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,520
the project is the community active

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
is it responsive when problems

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,600
come up how do they handle that when

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
people have questions about the

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,960
technology

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,919
are they responsive are they there to

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679
support

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,960
the needs of the people that actually

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,080
rely on the project uh is there a spirit

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,679
of collaboration

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,720
behind the project uh and and these are

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
things that i

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,280
continued to keep in mind as i evaluated

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,880
some of these

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,679
building blocks another particular

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,120
element that i looked at very carefully

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,280
was

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,640
what would be the implication if i

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,760
rely on an existing project from an open

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,799
source project

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
how would that impact my intellectual

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,080
property

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,080
will i be exposing myself if i touch

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,640
this code if i make any modification if

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,480
i bring it in house and i make it a part

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
of my solution

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,559
does that mean that i'm gonna have to

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,240
give my ip do i

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,240
have to essentially

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
give up my competitive advantage that

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,120
was on another

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,280
criteria that i looked at very carefully

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,200
and last but not least and by the way

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,840
this is not an all-inclusive list

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,720
i am sure there's many other criteria

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
that you

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,000
uh personally might uh add to this list

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,480
but these are the things that i

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,760
considered very very closely and looked

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,640
at very carefully

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,000
in deciding which elements and which

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
projects to

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,630
experiment with and which projects to be

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,200
able to

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,440
[Music]

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,679
make it a part of my solution and the

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,880
other one is deployability

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
how easy would it be for me to grab

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,280
their bits

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,159
and put them together and start

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,159
an evaluation process once i have that

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,200
in place how easy is it for me to be

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
able to

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,600
make an update how

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,480
easy would it be for a

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,280
potential adapter to leverage the

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
technology

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,720
and bring it up to date so

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,760
those are the elements that i looked at

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
very very carefully

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,640
so as i alluded earlier

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
last year we won a contract with the

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,880
department of the navy

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,559
to create an edge analytics node for

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,000
condition-based maintenance of

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,240
various systems we created a digital

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
twin of their proportional system

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,640
propulsion

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,440
system to create to include the gas

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,320
turbine

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,720
the compressor the hull and even the

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,559
propeller mechanism

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
the limitation is sparse communication

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,760
of ship to shore as you might have

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,000
as you might remember so all the data

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,120
collected cannot be effectively sent

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,039
to shore to be analyzed there so

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,559
with those limitations in mind we looked

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,320
at okay so

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,520
what can we do and how

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
with the data that we collect and what

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,880
kinds of

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,880
ways can we contribute

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,400
to the problem that they were trying to

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,960
solve and the problem

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,840
effectively was one of so we have all

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,559
this data

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,520
we have the capability of doing very

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,799
sophisticated

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,280
analysis to be able to tell which

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,240
particular systems need attention and

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,760
how

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,400
uh we have all kinds of different

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,080
algorithms that we can apply in fact we

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,600
could do all this

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,240
while the ship is at sea

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,720
but the problem was that we couldn't

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,440
send all the data back to the shore

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
real time or actually in any other way

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,840
to be analyzed

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
for the purpose of scheduling an

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,480
intervention

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,640
when the ship got to shore so again

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,799
what ends up happening today is that the

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,679
navy collects a lot of different data

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,200
from different

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:54,000
sensors and different components

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,880
and if if that data could be transferred

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,600
as it is being collected to the shore

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
then

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
one can conceive a whole bunch of

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,480
different algorithms that are operating

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,640
on that data

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,559
and keeping an eye on the health of the

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,600
assets

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,760
for which these sensors are um

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,799
attached and as we might remember

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,919
having access to the data over satellite

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,360
is not exactly very feasible so with

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
that in mind we created an

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,400
edge node prototype that ingests data

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,480
from on-board sensors

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
in fact 25 different sensors in this

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
case

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,039
we created a dashboard to display the

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
telemetry data

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,240
for maintainers on board and the edge

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,320
analytic node

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
crunches the numbers to assess the state

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,640
of the decay and percent efficiency

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,360
instead of sending all the data to shore

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,279
in other words it actually

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
applies a bunch of different algorithms

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,799
and ml algorithms crunches the data

00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:01,840
and arrives at a as a

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,840
an assessment

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,000
this is what i am pointing at here at

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,159
the very bottom um

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
the

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,200
the area that is inside the square

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
and it crunches the numbers to us as the

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,440
state of

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,440
the or the health of the system and then

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
we have certain machine learning

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,799
algorithms that

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,640
eventually using a physics-based

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:35,279
simulation data's ground truth

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,279
monitors

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,679
and this is what we see at the upper

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,880
right hand side where we

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,799
effectively arrive at a conclusion an

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,120
assessment that says

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,720
this is where we are at this time so

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,240
with that kind of data

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,400
then we can assess what do we do now

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,440
knowing that the gas turbine

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,159
is in a state of decay knowing that uh

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,720
the compressor needs attention knowing

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,279
that the

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,120
propeller is alright is getting to the

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,080
point where it might need

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,799
uh an intervention we can then use that

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,919
information

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,000
to provide an assessment

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,240
and this is what we see here on this

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,279
particular screenshot

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,000
the elements that we see on this

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,159
particular

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,240
slide on the right hand side is actually

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,400
a screenshot of the ibm

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,600
maximo assets system

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,760
asset management system and

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
what we were proposing was that we have

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
this

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,960
edge analytics node that crunches all

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
the data

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
analyzes the data arrives at a an

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,880
assessment

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,320
decides how what's the state of health

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,360
of the particular asset that we're

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,279
monitoring

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,960
and determines that an intervention is

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,640
needed it sends

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,760
a request or sends or provides

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,200
information through

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,760
maximo uh to indicate

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,559
an actionable insight in other words

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,039
instead of

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,480
sending all the data to shore why not

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,120
simply send

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
the results of the assessment so at any

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
rate

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,960
this is exactly what i was pointing at

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:25,039
earlier this is an example of

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,679
that assessment where we indicate

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,799
uh by the way keep in mind this is this

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,919
was a very

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,360
rude uh sorry

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,360
very rudimentary prototype to illustrate

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,480
a concept and to illustrate what could

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,279
be done

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,200
clearly from from a ui standpoint we

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,200
could have done a lot more in terms of

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,440
presenting the things that needed

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
more attention or immediate attention in

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,600
red things that were just warning

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,440
we might have used maybe a yellow color

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,640
uh and things that were informational we

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,360
could have presented those

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
in in green so there's a lot more that

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
that could have been done we just wanted

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,360
to

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,720
convey the information or convey the

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,799
fact that

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,760
we don't need to send all that

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,440
information

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,679
to the cloud we could actually move the

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,840
processing closer to the edge

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,520
and then make an assessment and then

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,000
only communicate

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,799
what is actually necessary or what needs

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,399
to be done

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,399
as a result of that assessment

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,960
so that's the end of my presentation i

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,320
was actually

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,880
surprised that i could cover all that in

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,600
the time that i did um this is actually

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,640
a list of

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,559
uh is our call to action if you will

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,640
um so in our experience you know

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,000
uh try to determine the relevant

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
conditions and constraints of the

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
project

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,000
environment as i tried to do

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,279
in your research in your exposure to the

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,159
different elements

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
use the best criteria possible for your

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,080
particular

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,640
use case for your particular set of

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,960
circumstances as a

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
some organization that may be developing

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
a solution

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,200
look at what are the different

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,640
constraints you need to address

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,679
uh look at uh the community uh

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,919
that's behind the project

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,039
uh and reach out to them uh what i

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,159
actually found out

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:32,000
was that if i were to decide

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,080
just on my experience with

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,520
the level of support of the community it

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
would have been impossible for me to

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,880
actually

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,960
decide on one particular offering

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
because uh when i started looking at

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
these projects i

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,679
actually reached out to different people

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,200
from

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,760
different foundations from the different

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,320
projects and at all times

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,240
i i sensed that there was an element a

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,960
very strong element of collaboration

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,919
and a very strong element of wanting to

00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,360
help of

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,760
of actually contributing and

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,679
collaborating and that was actually very

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,159
encouraging to me

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
another uh suggestion that i have for

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,960
you is uh

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,360
if you have an opportunity read that

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,000
state of the age report

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,000
there's a link to it on this slide

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,240
it is actually a very comprehensive

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,039
document it's actually

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,880
like 99 pages if i remember correctly

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,799
there's a lot of great information there

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,799
lots of different viewpoints which is

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,919
something that i also found very useful

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,080
because uh

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,960
sometimes it's hard to get out of your

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,399
mindset

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,720
as a developer sometimes you develop you

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,200
know this tunnel vision and sometimes

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,240
being exposed to a different point of

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,600
view

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,960
turns out to be extremely helpful

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,120
um another call to action uh

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,360
try to get that other uh paper from the

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,960
linux foundation sharpening the edge

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,919
where they talk about the vh taxonomy

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,360
and how

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,760
uh uh you can

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,279
move the edge uh through that continuum

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,760
from from the data center to the edge or

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,559
the

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,640
extreme edge uh and what

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,840
that entails and and that was probably

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
the biggest value that i

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,640
extracted out of that paper uh and

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,960
finally if we can be of any help to you
