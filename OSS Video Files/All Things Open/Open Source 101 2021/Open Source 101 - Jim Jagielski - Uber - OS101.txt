thank you thank you amber first of all

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
thank you everyone

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
for uh for attending i know there are a

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
bunch of sessions around this time frame

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
um and so the very fact that you chose

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,359
this one means a lot to me i really

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
appreciate that

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,880
um if you are familiar with me at all

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,600
you must probably know me

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,240
due to my association with the apache

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,960
software

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
foundation which i uh co-founded and

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
actually served on the board

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,800
for almost two decades up until like

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
or so i've been heavily involved with

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
open source uh since very very from the

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,840
beginning

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,719
and so in many ways this will be an

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
introductory

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
to open source uh some of the historical

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,600
perspectives

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,640
uh both subjective and objective

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,399
as well as i mentioned earlier on if you

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,879
have any questions during the

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,800
presentation please don't hesitate to

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,079
ask i will say some time

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,280
towards the end for q a but i like

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
having dialogues

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
um rather than monologues so again even

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
though we're virtual it's still make

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,560
this is as

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,360
as free and as agile as possible

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
so um let's talk a little bit about the

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
pre-history

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,640
of of open source and by pre-history i

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,439
mean

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,159
basically before 1999

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,600
1998 um back then

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
software was really not

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,960
i wouldn't say a valuable resource

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,560
because it was valuable but

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,119
it wasn't a valuable as in costly

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,600
resource um it wasn't something that

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
people needed to worry about you know

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,799
buying or licensing or things of that

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,399
nature

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,439
because really at that period of time

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
it was all about the large machines it

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,840
was all about

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,719
the main frames in many ways

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
these mainframes were the software

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,759
dongles

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,759
of the early computer ages so the value

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
the expense was actually in the

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,760
owning and running of the computers and

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,400
not so much in the software itself

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
but what so what we saw earlier on in

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
those days is that

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
if you were lucky enough um and

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,599
fortunate enough and maybe

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
rich enough or you know whatever to be

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
able to afford these really really heavy

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,599
machines these uh

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
you know and the people to do it the

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,480
software itself that was

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,080
used were usually shared among many

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
people outside there

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,200
so even before there was this concept of

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,879
open source or free software

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,120
there was sharing of software

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,920
out there among universities among

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
companies

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,760
i mean bsd is most probably the best

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,760
example of that

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,840
where in addition to the 18t system 5

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
unix alternatives in there you had the

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
bse the berkeley software

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
distribution running along in parallel

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
on various systems

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
platforms out there and so bsd has that

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
heritage

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
there was really open source and the

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,760
whole concepts of open source

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,000
early on the days even when it wasn't

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
called open source back then

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
and really when you looked at it a lot

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
of the

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
infrastructure associated with the

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,760
internet

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,360
was based on what we call nowadays open

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
source software so

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,440
um the file sharing protocols of ftp and

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,440
and go for for example sending email

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,799
back and forth with the send mail or

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
s mail or qmail um you know the dns

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
system

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
combined and just the ad little you know

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
the actual software itself

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,040
to run the internet these were all

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,519
freely available

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
really modifiable uh you know and they

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
encourage

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,959
people that became to actually

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,599
contribute to these software projects

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
it wasn't until we saw this migration

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
from

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
the large mainframes to mini computers

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,360
to microcomputers

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,159
to even pcs that software started

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,519
becoming

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,879
a much more of a valuable resource

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,519
as the hardware got cheaper

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
software became i wouldn't say more

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
expensive

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,160
but became a viable alternative to

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
make expense to make revenue it became

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
possible now

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
to make a business around selling

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,120
software because the audience

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,919
for that was much larger and so software

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
became

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,520
much more expensive and by making it

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
much more expensive

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
became much more proprietary you could

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
make it expensive by

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
selling licenses to it it was around

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,080
this time

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,960
that the free software movement and the

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,199
new organization kind of came around

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
now it's important to remember that for

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
for this particular case

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
what the free software uh movement was

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
all about was software freedom being

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,720
a moral imperative that software needed

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,360
to be freely available to people

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
that it was really all about the license

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,280
it was really all about the availability

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,759
of the license in all cases and so

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
it really moved around the idea of these

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,280
four

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
fundamental freedoms which were defined

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
and

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,800
and critical in the whole aspect of what

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,039
created and what moved free software

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
now because of the use of the word free

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
some people think hey does it mean free

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
as in free as in

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,919
a free lunch or free beer and it means

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
free as in free speech

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,680
and there's some confusion about that

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,639
sometimes and so that's the reason why

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
some places

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,080
the word libre is is used and you

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
actually see

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,360
free software com sometimes called floss

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
f l

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,479
o s s for free libre open source

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:52,000
software it was about in 1998 1999

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,199
that as much impact as the free software

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,800
movement had there were aspects of it

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,360
that people found restricting um

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
including the more imperative aspect of

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
it

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,639
uh the the conceived um ideas

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,720
that uh you know taking something which

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
was free software and closing it up and

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
making it proprietary

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
was not was not allowed was not

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,919
something that should be encouraged

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,800
and so the open source initiative uh

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
created

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,639
itself in 1998 with the ideas that

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
what we're really concerned about is

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,840
open source

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,919
as an entity 10 conditions 10 criteria

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,039
that a license must have for it to be

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
considered an

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
open source license and these are the 10

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,199
out there and you'll see that many of

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,080
these do not

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
restrict in any way the taking of these

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
software resources

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
and closing them up making them

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,199
commercial making them proprietary

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
something which is very very different

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,080
from the concepts of freedom

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,319
in the free software foundation so again

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,639
we're seeing that most of the software

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,639
was really moving towards software that

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
was really much more of an open source

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
flavor

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
rather than a free software flavor even

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,360
though around this time

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
uh the the terms were used

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
interchangeably

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
but what really kicked off the success

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
of open source

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,120
and the open source success movement i

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,400
think are two things first of all

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,440
was the rise of the world wide web

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,919
i mean this was what really moved um

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
the internet and internet technologies

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
away from

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,160
academia away from businesses you know

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,479
away from um

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
you know governments in towards

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,639
businesses

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,120
in towards users into the uh

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
the consumer industry inside there and

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
that took quite a while

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
quite a period of time some people

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,240
remember there was actually

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,240
an excessive an acceptable use policy

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
inside the internet very very early on

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
that said that you couldn't use it for

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,639
commercial purposes

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
it wasn't in the world wide web came on

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,919
board that these

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
changes started happening so i think

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,039
that was one of the major reasons why

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,319
open source became

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,440
much more popular the second thing

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,199
was the lamp stack linux

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,440
apache mysql and php

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,280
this was really the first opportunity

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
where people realized that you could

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,360
take

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,080
a software stack that was completely

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,199
open source and most of the time under a

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,319
very permissive

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,919
or a weak copy left kind of license and

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,599
create a business around to create an

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
entire

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,159
infrastructure around it that allowed

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,800
you

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,880
and your business to really you know

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,919
play with the big boys and have as much

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,279
power have a much

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
authority have as much visibility as the

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
people who had

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
unlimited funds the lampstack can't be

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
minimized as far as

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,279
one of the main reasons why open source

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,160
succeeded in the world

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
now right in this period of time because

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,600
there was

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,519
success inside of open source there came

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
the rise of what's called fud

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,360
fear uncertainty and doubt

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
and the concept behind that is because

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
this whole

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
concept of sharing information this

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
whole concept

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,080
of software being available under an

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,399
open source license and collaboration

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
and collaboration being the rule of the

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,680
day

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,399
was seen as a threat to existing

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
software companies whose entire business

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
was built

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
around having closed source proprietary

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
software

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,720
either applications or operating systems

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,720
and selling licenses to the software out

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,720
there i mean this was back in the day

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,760
when uh microsoft had referred to linux

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,920
and open source

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,640
as the great cancer it was seen as

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
something very very bad that it was

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
going to be

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
something that needed to be destroyed

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,000
because

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,680
of the threat that it imposed the to

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,079
this proprietary

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
software service model and as we'll see

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,760
and as we all know

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,200
that has really really changed nowadays

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
from a company that

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
as i said before claimed that open

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
source was a cancer

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,200
to now one of the biggest proponents of

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,160
open source the change in microsoft

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
is due to the real value and the real

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,079
properties that open source

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,600
brings to the table when you start

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,480
talking about software development

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
now really let's dive a little bit

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,000
deeper

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,560
into the concepts of open source

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
now in general something cannot be

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
considered

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,079
open source it can't be an open source

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,399
product or an open source project

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,519
unless it is under an open source

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
license i mean that is

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
really one of the main criteria of any

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,920
open source project

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,680
and it's important to remember that

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,519
because the way copyright

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,800
is written once you create something it

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,320
is immediately

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,560
under copyright you have to explicitly

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
put it under a license for it to be

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,279
available under an open source license

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
so just because something is available

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
under get

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,440
a hub for example if there's not an

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,920
explicit license associated with that

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
you really don't have the access and the

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,200
rights to it that you would think

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
so always make sure that there is a

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,839
license associated with the software

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
project

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
that you're using because that's the

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,120
only guarantee that you have that it

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,959
really is an open source project

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
and in general there are three main

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,360
types of open source licenses out there

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
the first are the permissive licenses

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
which they basically say

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
you can do anything you want with it

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,440
just give us credit

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,279
these are the mit bsd licenses the

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
apache license for example

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,800
there's also the weak copyleft licenses

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,480
which are like the

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,320
eclipse public license and lgpl

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
which basically says you know you need

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
to give us if you distribute the

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,760
software with fixes you need to provide

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
those fixes to us

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
and finally there's the strong copula

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,639
that says anything

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
that your software that a gpl software

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
uses and

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
becomes part of a larger distributed

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,240
work that needs to be available

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
under this strong copyleft license as

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
well

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
so really again the main takeaway for

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
this is that

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,920
licenses is important if it's not under

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
an open source license

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,639
it is not an open source project that's

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,839
it full stop

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,160
but the biggest addition

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,000
to availability under an open source

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
license and josh simmons an excellent

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
job earlier today

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
as keto talking about this is that

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
what's very important about it and what

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,560
really drives the success of open source

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,079
is not necessarily the license

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,519
but what the license provides which is

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:52,480
the ability to create a culture

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
around this open source asset to be able

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
to create

00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,480
a community around

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:04,000
a software code base this is what it

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
allows this is what makes the drive of

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
innovation

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,639
inside of open source is this focus on

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
community

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
so yeah even though something may be

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
under an open source license

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
if it doesn't have that sense of

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
community inside there it's really doing

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,560
itself

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
and the code base a disservice it really

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
is about

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,200
empowering people to contribute

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
and collaborate in these open source

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,440
projects and this is where the source of

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,959
innovation comes from

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,200
so really open source is about creating

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,040
an environment and a culture

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,440
that drives collaboration among people

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,440
and this can only happen when there is

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,320
full transparency

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
not only in the decision-making process

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,959
but also

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,240
in how the code is handled in the

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,480
governance process

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
about you know uh you know what the

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
features need to be happening

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
what the road map looks like what issues

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,079
and bugs need to be

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
looked at this is the one of the reasons

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,600
why in many many cases you'll see that

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
asynchronous communication such as such

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,160
as email

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
is used really heavily in successful

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,600
open source projects

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,240
and it's not because the people behind

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,079
it you know are really fans of older

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
older technology

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,800
but email and other asynchronous

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,279
communication patterns are really good

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,480
at first of all because they're on

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,680
public mailing lists

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,519
it drives the sense of transparency it

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
also doesn't disenfranchise people who

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
may be

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
located in different time zones for

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
example

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
you set an email app and you can wait

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,480
for it whereas if you send something on

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
irc

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
or slack or via zoom or whatever

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
communication

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,160
method you're talking about before

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,320
you're necessarily

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,279
being favorable towards people who

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
happen to be in the

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,519
same time zone as you or have the same

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,480
flexibility and freedom as far as

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,399
time is concerned so really this is what

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,519
not drives that

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,920
i love analogies in metaphors i think

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,720
they're a great way of looking at it and

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,320
i think what

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,959
really makes open source is important

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,880
the license in the community can really

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,079
be driven home by this analogy and i

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
really want to give credit to mark

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,040
hinckle who was the first one

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,320
to really make me think of this analogy

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,320
think of beer okay back in the day

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
all neighborhoods or most neighborhoods

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
and cities had

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,160
um you know their own local beer flavors

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
outside of there and what do we see

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,160
happen well

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,959
there was this consolidation of of

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
of breweries such that you had you know

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,399
now

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,360
like two or three large mega

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
conglomerates

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
who provide beer and what was the

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,639
reaction to that in the community about

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
people who really really were serious

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
about beer

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,120
well the microbial industry you saw

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
these small

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,959
companies pop up to be able to provide

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
alternatives to people

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,079
the same with music when you start

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,600
looking at such

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:10,160
musical um you know

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,800
realms such as hip hop and and jazz and

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160
punk

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,040
and grunge what were these where these

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,360
were really

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,560
a revolution against the the commercial

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,959
uh mass-produced bloodless

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,680
passionness medium that was produced

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,120
for us by some entity who thinks it

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,440
knows better

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,880
instead of actually being crafted

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,160
by us open source is really

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,959
a return to the hacker culture

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,759
that was so prevalent several decades

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,560
ago

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,000
the idea of a beautiful hack that you

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,800
could get and share with other

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
people and people could improve upon in

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,759
a lot of ways it's also

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
very very similar to the scientific

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,920
method and how we do

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
uh you know drive innovation in science

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
and in health

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
where it's only by making this

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,120
information public

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
by making the ability to share the

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,839
information and build on top of it

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,600
which really drives the technological

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,360
advantages you see in health

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,679
which drive the advances you see in

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,480
science well this is how you're doing

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,760
advancement

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,319
and innovation inside of software is by

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,600
using

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
and leveraging open source now one thing

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
that

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,960
needs to be incredibly clear is that

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,000
all contributions are useful

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,200
all contributions are vital

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,679
to the success of open source and open

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,440
source

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,000
communities it's not just code now

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,200
we still have a long way to go regarding

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,679
that concern

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
you know that you know there is the you

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
know in 1984

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,039
no not 1984 animal farm in the other

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,360
georgia orwell book

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,120
you know all pigs are equal but some

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,200
pigs are more equal than others and

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,400
there are still in some communities

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,960
this idea that um if you produce

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,919
code if you contribute code you're

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
somehow

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,760
more of a valuable community member than

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,960
if you do other things

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,240
and that's just simply not true okay

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,360
all contributions are vital diversity

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
and inclusion

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,720
is incredibly critical to the long-term

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
health and viability

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
of any ecosystem whether it's a

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,960
biological ecosystem

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,880
or whether it's a software uh you know a

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
development ecosystem

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,200
you need additional insights you need

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,160
different world views you need

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,799
all kinds of contributions to make this

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,559
continue

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,960
on the reason why open source

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
in a collaborative consensus space

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
action

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,080
is really the main keys to success that

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,039
we're seeing and those are the open

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,440
source projects

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,880
that people are really going towards is

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,520
because they know

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
they have a long-term viable solution

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,840
out there

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,440
that they're going to be there for the

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,919
long run and that's

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
only possible if you have a healthy

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,919
viable

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
diverse and inclusive community now why

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,720
do people contribute to open source why

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,440
is it something that

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
people will volunteer their time to do

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
well there are a couple reasons first of

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
all

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,360
is that it gives you the ability to have

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
impact and influence on software that

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
really is

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,400
world changing i mean as much of the

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,240
cliche that it as that is

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
how often do you get a chance to do

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,280
something on a volunteer time

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,799
which really impacts the world or huge

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,720
swaths of the population

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,400
it can make the world a better place so

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,320
there's a lot of personal satisfaction

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
people get out of doing that

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,840
another thing is this sense of community

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,000
become a viable

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,760
important part of community out there

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
there's this old meme that you know

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,080
software developers

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
are isolated people who spend their time

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
down

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
in the basement in their underwear under

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
you know almost no lights at all hacking

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
away

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
and that's definitely not true what we

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
see is that

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,039
open source is a recognition that

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,600
software developers

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,640
all contributions and all contributors

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
are artists

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
and as artists you want to share your

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
skills

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
you want to hone your craft and you want

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,640
to work with like-minded people

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,640
but why do companies also uh are into

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,360
open source why what's the advantage for

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,600
them

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,440
well first of all is the security aspect

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,159
of it because open source

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,159
is baselined around the idea that the

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,640
source code is shared

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,320
and the the development process is

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
extremely transparent

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
it's got a much higher level of security

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,840
inside of there

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,880
so the uh availability and the

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
feasibility

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
of back doors and things of that nature

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
is significantly reduced

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,919
and also there is the many i's meme

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,760
where

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,360
as many people who are looking at it

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,600
bugs are really found

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,679
and squashed much more quickly and in

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
general open source is much more

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,240
performant than closed source solutions

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
out there

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,559
because it needs to address a wider

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,039
range of audiences a wider range

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,240
of environments out there another reason

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,520
why companies

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,440
use open source is it allows them to try

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,919
things become much more agile

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
not as agile development process but

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,360
agile as

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,600
in quickly changing quickly pivoting

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,840
quickly refocusing their energies on

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,320
different ideas and different solutions

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,159
based on what's going on if you had to

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,159
do that based on closed source

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,080
proprietary software that you had to buy

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,000
license get up to speed

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
you wouldn't be able to do that so it

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,480
really allows you the ability

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
to try something new and fail fast which

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
goes back to what jeff was talking about

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,200
in his talk

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
about failing something good that's how

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
you learn

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,720
well by leveraging open source inside of

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
a company you're enabling yourself to be

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,039
able to try things out

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,400
figure out what works and fail fast and

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,840
come up with the right

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
selection and also if you were a company

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,880
that

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,320
leverages open source and as long as you

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,039
are a really good

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,120
contributing member of that open source

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,840
community out there okay

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,799
you are able to enjoy an incredibly

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,919
tight

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,799
positive feedback loop where the people

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
that you are

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,039
working with are also the people who may

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,600
be your users your contributors

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
your potential employees your potential

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,840
partners

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
that tight feedback group is incredibly

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
successful

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
and incredibly important to providing

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,159
business value

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,600
for those associations and finally by

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,200
focusing your internal developer

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,440
resources i'll be just talking about

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,919
software right now but by focusing your

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
internal developer resources on the

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,880
stuff that provides the secret sauce to

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
the company

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,480
things that differentiate the company

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,960
the things that provide

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,520
value to the company that's how you

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
provide

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
innovation that is how your company

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
moves innovation

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
by leveraging open source where it's

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,799
possible you're able to focus those

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,080
talent and skills on things that

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,840
really make the company move forward

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,320
so what we're seeing here it is it's the

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,679
21st century 2021

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,320
um and we can point to countless

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
countless blog reports conferences

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
sessions that says open source wins

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
right

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,000
i mean that's you know certainly the

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,720
case after all

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
you know open source was the basis of

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,720
web 2.0

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,840
it's the basis of web 3.0 the you know

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,400
decentralized you know community

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
out there uh you can't think about big

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,960
data

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
without the impact that open source has

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,000
provided to it big data wouldn't be a

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
thing

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,440
if it wasn't for the open source

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,880
projects it basically implemented

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,000
that machine learning and aai are also

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,240
heavily based and heavily dependent

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,039
upon the the open source software

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
projects

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,200
that define that blockchain

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,600
you know the whole uh you know again

00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,919
decentralized

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,720
uh distributed aspects associated with

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,039
it again this is an important aspect

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
open source is driving this chain

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,720
microservices

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,080
even that idea itself is really

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
important and critical

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,159
in the idea of open source open source

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,200
is driving microservices

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,799
and driving devops there really isn't a

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
technology area

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,360
even fintech and fenserv there is really

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,159
isn't a technology area

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,679
that isn't impacted and driven by open

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,919
source outside there

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,000
in fact what we're even seeing now is

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,880
companies are taking the lessons learned

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,400
of how to build and run successful open

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
source projects

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,799
and moving that internally you know

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,960
instead of the agile development method

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,640
you know scrums and stuff like that

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
they're instead running their internal

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
projects

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,440
as if they were open source projects the

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
concept called inner source

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,559
so we're seeing that open source is not

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
even driving

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
technology driving you know innovations

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,279
inside of different you know

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,799
infrastructural realms it's actually

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,360
changing how companies are

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,200
building software themselves and of

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,799
course you can't look at any company i

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
mean we're obviously we're familiar with

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,600
the

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
quote tech companies which are using

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,520
open source and they wouldn't be

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,440
anywhere near where they are now if it

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,360
wasn't for open source

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,279
but really at the end of the day all

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,039
companies are realized that they are

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,600
tech companies and open source is

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,039
important and vital to their set

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,520
it's really is world wide so open source

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,880
wins

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,600
obviously of course right well does it

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
does open source win i mean what we've

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,360
seen

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,159
over the last couple days is here it is

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,279
we're like

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,279
one yard from the goal line and we seem

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,919
to be taking some steps back

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,919
for example right now there is this

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,200
drive towards what i call

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,559
hype driven other than tech driven

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,080
design infrastructure architecture

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
hey why are you do why are you

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
baselining this particular software

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
project why are you

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
baselining this open source project oh

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
because everybody is

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,320
okay that's really not what open source

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,039
was about open source was to enable you

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,159
to make your

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,120
own decisions be masters of your own

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
destiny to make the decision based on

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,400
yourself

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,679
because it was basically no cost to try

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,559
different things

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,720
it was focused on the technology rather

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,760
than the hype associated with it

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,159
we've also seen the return of fud lately

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,799
fear

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,039
uncertainty and doubt in many ways

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
related to business models associated

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,200
with it

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,760
the idea that for some reason um

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,080
open source is not compliant or not

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,440
viable with a business model nowadays if

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,400
you want to build

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,679
um a company around open source and open

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,360
source solutions

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,279
all you have to change things you have

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,200
to change the license now

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,600
there was the the issue with the commons

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,080
calls which was basically

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,840
an ad on that was usually added on top

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,919
of the apache license that said

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,440
oh yeah this is under the apache license

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,360
but there's this additional

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
addendum that immediately made the

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,400
software no longer open source but

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,400
if you weren't familiar with that if you

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
weren't really tracking and being aware

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
what was going on

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
you would think it was open source

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,840
you've been seeing

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,559
also the push of various new license and

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,760
licensing models out there specifically

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,760
designed to make you

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,880
think that this is an open source

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,320
solution

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,559
but really it's not it's designed to

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,080
give you that false sense of assurance

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,480
give you that false sense of the good

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,720
housekeeping seal of approval the false

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,679
sense is this is an open source project

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,880
under an open source license run in a

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,520
community

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,399
collaborative culture when it really

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,840
isn't

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,240
they're really trying to redefine the

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,760
principles

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,480
that were successful for open source

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,520
open source wasn't successful despite

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,600
these principles

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
that they're fighting against open

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,000
source was successful

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,360
because of the principles and so by

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
redefining those

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,919
you really do a disservice to everything

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,760
out there another thing that we've seen

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,360
um and i'm so glad that josh talked

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,080
about foundations at his keynote

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,000
was this idea of facade foundations

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
foundations only work when they become

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,440
really really neutral entries for for

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,520
communities um and people and

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,960
individuals and corporations

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,399
to all collaborate together

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,640
in a very very equal cohesive places

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,960
but what we've seen is that some people

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
in some cases and some corporations and

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,640
some

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,880
projects have created this idea of a

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,559
facade corporation so yeah it looks like

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,440
it's being run by an open source

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
foundation

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,039
but when you look at it it really isn't

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,880
it's more of a walled garden

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,320
that you still have no more freedoms

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,600
over it that

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,880
only the company who is the head of the

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,000
foundation

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,039
controls the roadmap recall controls

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,880
who can contribute can control which um

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
you know contributions are accepted and

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
which ones aren't

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,320
and the increase of pay to play that

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,039
yeah if you want to join and be a

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,640
a willing partner and collaborating on

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,960
this open source project

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
well you better have deep pockets and a

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,159
really really big wallet

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,799
because the more say you have is

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,360
fully dependent upon how much money you

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,520
pony up into these foundations

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,960
again this is all going against the idea

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,279
that open source about

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,480
controlling your own destiny controlling

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,080
your own skills

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
having the awareness to make those

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,159
decisions for yourself

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,640
okay this is what the history of open

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,360
source has provided to us

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,360
we need to keep the revolution going and

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
it is a revolution

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,480
you know there wasn't there wouldn't be

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,880
as much um

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,600
a flood and push back from it earlier on

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,120
if it wasn't

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,440
and there wouldn't be existing pushback

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,440
one right now if it wasn't

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,600
i think one of the biggest things that

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,360
we need to seriously think about and

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,720
seriously consider

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,320
is that those of us from my

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,600
generation and i mean the open source

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,880
generation is that we have a duty

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,279
we really have a serious duty to foster

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,360
the new generation and that's one of the

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,200
reasons why i love the all things open

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,600
events and especially the open source

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,840
101 events is because

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,799
this kind of fostering this kind of

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,919
mentoring

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,360
this kind of education can't be found

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,399
anyplace else

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
okay the situation has changed

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,799
there is an upcoming generation that

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
thinks that simply because and i'm not

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,760
picking on github

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,279
you know for anybody but just because

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,760
something is on github

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,679
that's how you do open source okay

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,799
without thinking about the community

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,960
aspects of it about

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,200
not thinking about the whole idea about

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,679
how do you work together as a community

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
associated with it what are the reasons

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,399
for an open source license

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,559
being the way it is these are lessons

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,880
learned that it took a while

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,919
for the people of the the first

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
generation

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
to move and drive and it really is a

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
disservice to the movement into the

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
up-and-coming generation

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,279
if we don't foster the new generation

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,679
coming up

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,279
so my call to duty in addition to

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,039
learning more about open source and

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,399
finding an open source project

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,720
that you really want to get involved

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,080
with is that if you are

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,720
one of the um the first or

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,760
primal generations of the open source

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,559
movement

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,159
be a mentor share that knowledge share

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,159
that enthusiasm

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,760
really let people know the passion

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,399
that's inside of you

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,440
be a mentor and if you're someone just

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,720
starting

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,760
find a mentor find a project that speaks

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
to you

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,919
because i promise you that the impact of

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,480
open source

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,320
isn't just about the software it's about

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,240
the personal connections you make

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,399
it's about the personal growth that you

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,600
make that in addition

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,960
drives open source and software

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,559
innovation

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,120

fact please don't hesitate to reach out

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:15,200
um i i take the idea of mentoring

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,240
and fostering a new generation extremely

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,839
seriously

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,000
so anything i can do to help you out in

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,040
your journey i'm here for you

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,560
okay enjoy everyone

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,639
i actually have a question for you

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,280
someone who's been around since uh

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
the early 90s and and often see many of

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
the things that that you were talking

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,359
about and

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,679
and these greatest challenges to those

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,599
of us i think you issued a very good

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,320
call to action to everybody

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,679
um with you know what what you can do if

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,000
you're new or what you can do if you've

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,000
been

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
been around a while but what do you

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,720
think you know because

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,320
because a lot of us don't remember what

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,760
it's like to be new

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,760
in this and we have to go back and

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,560
remember what it's like to to get

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,359
started

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,960
what do you think the biggest mistake

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,800
that we often make

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,520
when we're trying to mentor and can't

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,560
put our ourselves back in those shoes

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
yeah i think most

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
probably the biggest mistake uh or the

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,680
biggest issue

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,720
is that um

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,359
we you said it perfectly we forget what

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,880
it's like

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,000
to be new we re forget what it's like

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,280
to be nervous about about it you know

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,480
and so in a lot of ways um

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,400
it's really incumbent upon us to like

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,280
pull people in as well as expecting them

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
to become more involved so you know as

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
people

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,920
ask questions dig a little bit deeper

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
you know find out what it is that drives

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,560
them you know hey

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,079
what was it that drove you to this

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,240
particular um

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,480
you know open source project or if

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,119
you're handling a github issue or a bug

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,880
report

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,160
hey what what situation are you using

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,280
where did you hit you know

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,200
find a way to make it personal because

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,040
that's what really this is about is

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,440
creating a personal connection

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,240
with the people so you have a personal

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
community

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
that makes you know that's the only way

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,839
to really keep an open source project

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,760
up and running i always hate the idea um

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,280
and we use it a lot the whole idea about

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,240
building a community

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,960
you know and i i as much as i understand

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,880
that term

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
i don't like it because like you build a

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,920
chair you build a desk you build a

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,880
concrete static structure that is dead

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
whereas

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,160
i prefer like you know fostering a

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,240
community or

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,760
growing a garden because that really

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,000
implies what you're doing

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,880
and it's a continuing opting you know

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,119
you're you're

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,400
you don't build it and it's done it's

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,760
always ongoing

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,599
and i think that's something else that

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,280
we need to remember as people who've

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,839
been in here for a while

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,480
is that we need to keep things going we

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,480
need to meet things

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,960
all right and guys popping up guy we'll

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
be with you in just a moment guys our

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
next speaker

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,119
and i did have one other question for

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,320
you because we do see

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,839
that um we see people who get involved

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,359
and have been involved for a long time

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,400
and either burnout hits them

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,240
or they lose that enthusiasm because it

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,720
does seem like at times there is a fight

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,200
that revolution going on can you with

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,960
with

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,000
two minutes left can you share a story

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,160
that really kind of made you dig deeper

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,599
and stay involved and stay excited and

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,640
stay you know

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,160
enthusiastic about open source

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,400
is there is there a point in time that

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,040
happened for you um i think there's been

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,079
a number of points in time you know and

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,320
and you know i i just remember

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,440
i don't consider myself any big shakes

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,400
you know at all

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,800
you know i mean there are a lot of

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,599
people with a much deeper

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,280
historical um you know involved with

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,079
with open source inside there

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,960
but i remember being at this one um one

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,960
convention

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,640
uh that was i had a number of talks i

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,280
remember um

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,160
in fact it was all things open event and

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,680
it was

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,000
when they were really really focusing

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,040
towards students and driving in

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,079
the younger generation and i remember

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,359
this this young woman who i guess was

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,000
maybe a freshman

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,119
in in college being attending all the

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
all the sessions

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,400
and being in like the first two rows and

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,880
something like that

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,000
um and i could tell that she was nervous

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,240
about wanting to ask

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,119
questions as if i was some kind of

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,960
whatever

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,880
you know and just the very fact that

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,839
that she was nervous but wanted to know

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
more

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,359
and i realized that this was an

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
opportunity for me to get out of my

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,240
comfort zone

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
because i'm actually although it doesn't

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,920
look like someone you know

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,520
reserved person and they come and say

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,599
hey i noticed you were you know at some

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,599
of these sessions you know

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,720
how can i help you you know what what

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,400
drives you here

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,040
and just the very fact that there were

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,119
people who you knew that

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,160
just a little thing like that would make

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,920
such a difference

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,040
in their careers and how often

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,680
we just don't even notice

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,720
when those opportunities pop up i think

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,599
that's most probably the

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,040
the biggest thing i think you have

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,160
empowered a lot of people

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,599
um to continue their journey um in open

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,320

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,200
