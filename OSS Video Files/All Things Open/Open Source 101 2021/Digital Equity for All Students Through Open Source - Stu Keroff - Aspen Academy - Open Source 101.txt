Description: 
	Stu Keroff, Social Studies and Technology Teacher at Aspen Academy, delivered the talk titled "Digital Equity for All Students Through Open Source" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Schools across America struggle with how to affordably provide Digital Equity for their students. The crisis brought on by COVID-19 exacerbated this problem. Aspen Academy’s student club, the Penguin Corps, rose to the challenge by using Linux and open-source software to recycle used computers. We placed these computers with students for learning at home, closing our school’s Digital Divide. And we saved our school $95,000 in the process! Come hear Penguin Corps leader Stu Keroff and some of his students explain how it works and how other schools can adopt this STEM instruction-based model.

Our presentation explains how our school addressed its COVID-19 induced digital equity problems through the use of open-source software and recycled computers. This enabled us to provide over 300 computers for students in need of distance/hybrid learning at home at a cost of less than $6,000. This closed our digital divide, providing necessary technology for all. This game-changing work was performed by the Aspen Academy Penguin Corps, our school’s middle school Linux club. This club gives students a hands-on service-learning experience and teaches them “in demand” technology skills.

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,520
all right

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
yeah let me just uh sort that out well

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,119
for starters

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
people sometimes find it strange to find

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,600
out that i

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,000
am not a coder or sis admin by trade

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,400
i'm a social studies teacher and it's

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,600
time for a history lesson

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,799
in september of 2019 i got a

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,799
new to country student in my class

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
this girl was working hard to learn a

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
new culture

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,119
including learning english i used google

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,719
translate to convert some materials to

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,320
russian for her

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,000
and while that was great at school it

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,719
really didn't help her at home because

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,200
her family didn't have a computer

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,360
luckily one of the first things i did

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
when i started working at aspen academy

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,920
was to start a club that taught kids how

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
to use

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,120
open source to refurbish old computers

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
those kids got to work on a machine for

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,560
my young russian friend

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,760
and we invited her mother to the school

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
to pick it up

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
both mom and daughter had tears in their

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
eyes when they found out that the

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,400
computer was

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,640
theirs to keep free of charge

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,040
we didn't know it at the time but this

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,519
was a process we would end up repeating

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
a few hundred times over the next year

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
and a half

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
without open source software it would

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
not have been possible

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
yep and and ruth um we're still not

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
showing the

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
being able to put the slides on at our

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
end if if you could check that out

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
please

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,400
but i'll just i'll just continue from

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
here okay

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,360
now i am a believer in the power

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
of open source to transform school

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,680
and because i'm a witness time i go to

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
work

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,440

okay there we go

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
and now click on uh my browser window

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,959
there

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,680
okay and go present

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,879
click the present button there you go

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
all right

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,480
okay now uh we're going to skip ahead a

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
little bit there dom

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,519
all right okay right there

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,159
perfect okay

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
as you well know most jobs today require

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,120
tech skills

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
so kids need to use tech at school to

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
get them ready for their futures

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
kids also need to have tech at home

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,319
because

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
that can become the place where they

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,919
attend school

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,519
but many families lack the means to get

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,240
computers for their kids and

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
no school anywhere has unlimited money

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,800
to meet these needs

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,680
these are pretty daunting problems but

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,759
what if i told you

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,120
that there is a solution that is doable

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,919
scalable and affordable

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
what if i told you that the digital

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,759
divide

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,639
can be closed what if i told you that

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
students

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,080
instead of being recipients of the

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,400
problem can help drive the solution

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
and what if i told you that the answer

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
can fit in the palm of your hand

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,199
we use a lot of flash drives at this

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,360
school they hold linux

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
the computer operating system that fuels

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
what we do

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,680
as for all those questions i just asked

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
all of those things are true

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
as some great students and i have been

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
innovating with open source for 10 years

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
here in minnesota

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
it started at community school of

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,800
excellence in st

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
paul it's now taking place at aspen

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,000
academy in savage

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,080
both of these schools have a linux club

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
first community school of excellence

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
it's among charter school

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
and its students are mostly hmong and

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,080
kareni

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,360
with a high refugee population high

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,639
language needs

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320
and high poverty similar in many ways to

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,000
schools in other communities

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,720
but different in one you see csc

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
is the home to the asian penguins the

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
school's computer club

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
the asian penguins were the first linux

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
club at a minnesota

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
school and the only one at among school

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
anywhere in the world

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
and they were the start of a unique

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,919
experiment

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,039
get open source software get used

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,440
computers

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
have kids do the work and see what

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,400
happens

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,600
the results of the experiment are in

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,919
this works

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
having kids use open source software in

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,560
school helps the kids

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,919
helps the school and helps the community

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
how did it start in 2011 community

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,680
school of excellence

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,240
launched a one-to-one laptop program and

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
we ran

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
into a lot of problems that any school

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,039
with a one-to-one program might have

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
students breaking laptops losing them

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
etc

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,919
to overcome the shortage in my classroom

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,639
i got help

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,280
from free geek twin cities who gave me

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
four

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,160
linux desktop computers they use linux

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,039
because linux is open source

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
free to get free to use for any purpose

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,880
free to change

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
and free to give away i was already a

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,479
linux user so i thought that was pretty

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
cool

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
well my students love the computers and

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
a few kids

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,440
started to come to my room after school

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,479
to use them

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
from that we started a club to learn

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,400
about using linux

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
the kids were all asian the mascot of

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,960
linux was a penguin

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,759
so we called it the asian penguins

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
but why should a school use linux at all

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
well

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
there are a few reasons other than the

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,960
obvious one that it's free

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,039
first having open source at school gives

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,520
students a unique experience

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
that very school very few schools will

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
offer

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
another reason for using open source at

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,800
school

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
is that it's used everywhere else set

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
top boxes

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,879
cell phones self-driving cars internet

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
connected crock pots the list goes on

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
if our kids decide to go into tech for a

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
career

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
they will need to know something about

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
open source

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,680
but the biggest reason is that using

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
open source in school

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
gave us an affordable way to have our

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,479
students become

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,720
technology leaders our school our kids

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
became what i call partners in the

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
process

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,080
the kids were learning how to install

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,400
the os configure the apps

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
run software updates and change computer

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
parts

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,919
and the computers they were working on

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,400
would be used by other students

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
we refurbished computers to give to

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,240
families at home

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,479
and did a crowdfunding campaign to get

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,440
laptops to use at school

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,440
in eight years the asian penguins had

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,279
over 250 kids

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,120
come through the program and we

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,159
introduced hundreds more

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,120
to linux and open source software

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,640
in 2019 i changed schools and now i'm at

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
aspen academy

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
for years we have been telling people

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,440
that any school could do this

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
so this was my opportunity to put that

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
to the test

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
in the asian penguins we made things up

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
as we went along

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,080
because there was no template for us to

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,360
follow but at aspen

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,959
we did have a template mine i knew what

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
a linux club could do

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
because i'd done it aspen's leadership

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
had

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,800
never heard of linux but when i

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
described what a linux club could be

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,360
for the kids and for the school they

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,560
couldn't say yes fast enough

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
the big question was will the kids be

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
interested

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,720
the answer was yes when we started at

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,640
that first meeting in 2019 we had 14

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
kids who wanted to learn linux and that

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,000
club has grown over time

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,519
with 37 right now and over 40

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,560
in two weeks a club needs a name right

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,720
we chose the penguin core the name

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,040
communicates a sense of mission and the

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
kids picked up on that right away

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,880
the aspen kids jumped in and started

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,000
learning about all the different

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
hardware components

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
how to install the os can how to

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,440
configure the apps and so on

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
and just like the kids at community

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,160
school of excellence the aspen kids

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
loved it

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,560
they learned they grew they discovered

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
and they started making a difference the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
way

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,959
that a school linux club makes an impact

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,079
is by following this equation open

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,720
source software

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
plus used computers plus enthusiastic

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
kids

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,399
equals more students learn

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,000
and it all happened from a pretty simple

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,640
idea get kids using open source software

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,720
and see what happens now it's time to

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,279
let the kids tell the story

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
thank you very much up first from the

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
students

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
is leighton hedrick

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,519
hi i'm leighton as you at quinn say

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
we're trying to change the world

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
well what happens when you try sometimes

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,560
you succeed

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,760
let me tell you about it in the penguin

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
corps we have weekly meetings on

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,600
wednesdays before school

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
at those meetings we select a leader to

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
be the master of ceremonies and to get

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
things going

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
we always started the same way the

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
leader asked us what are we trying to do

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,279
then we responded to change the world

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,959
then the leader asked us how do you

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
change the world and we were then we

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,760
replied

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
be crazy enough to think you can it gets

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
things started on a positive note and

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
kind of wakes us up in a way as well as

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,360
gets us excited about whatever we're

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
doing that morning

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
lessons started with learning how to

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,320
install software this isn't just the

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
apps but the actual operating system

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
itself

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
and doing the linux is very different

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
from doing it in windows

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,279
most of these computers we work on were

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,839
about to be sent to recycling

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,120
but with linux we revived them there are

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
currently in the classrooms of our

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
school as well as being used by hundreds

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
of students at distance learning

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,279
some of the students some of the lessons

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,079
we use came from the flossdesk talks

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,440
desktops for kids curriculum for open

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
source initiative

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
it has lots of good ideas that really

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
worked for us its author

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
patrick madison wanted to see schools

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
have a ready resource for doing this

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,519
kind of stuff

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,959
we recommend it most people today think

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,800
installing software means simply

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,399
clicking a button that says install

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
well that can be done in the linux world

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,639
too but in but we found that it's a lot

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,680
more fun to open up a terminal window

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,360
and type the commands

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,200
in fact all members of the penguin core

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
learned how to do this we never made a

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
requirement because everybody wanted to

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
do it anyway

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,480
i enjoy it too as i mentioned we

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
refurbished computers

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
we work on old computers that either the

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
school didn't want anymore or that

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,959
people gave to us

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,639
most of those were computers were played

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,240
with students that didn't have one

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
you'll learn more about that from jason

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
but here's a preview we'll close our

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,600
school's digital divide

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
we also provided computers for our

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
school we set up

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
full classroom sets of laptops first for

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
a few middle school compute classrooms

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,160
and

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,120
some in several station sets for several

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
elementary

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,720
classrooms along with putting six

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
computers in our school's media center

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
lots of kids were helpless here when our

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
school went to distance in hybrid

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,200
learning

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
more computers were needed for kids at

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,560
home we provided those too

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,480
along with keeping a steady supply of

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
laptops for the office in case it needed

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
to be replaced

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
for a kid even though there have been

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
times where our school was closing

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
converted to distance

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,240
to cover 19 we still tried to stay

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,760
together as a team by meeting a resume

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
from there we went to present down at

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,079
conferences just like this one and

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
started a youtube channel

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
you know what they say about all work

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
and no player right well we end each

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
season at the penguin court by having a

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
party

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,440
we get to have fun playing video games

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
and we eat a lot of snacks

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
well you might be asking what impact

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
does it have for starters many of our

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
teachers don't need to check out

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,399
computer cards because they have

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
computers

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
in their rooms since our start our links

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
user base has grown from zero

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,519
to hundreds of students we are learning

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
tech skills that we won't learn anywhere

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,680
else

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,600
at least not yet and let's not forget

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
that we closed our school digital divide

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
that at a time when we really needed it

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,840
thank you very much and coming up next

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:52,009
it's always well

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,009
[Applause]

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
good afternoon my name is sophie svella

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
i'd like to give a shout out to all the

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
women who have presented at this

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,199
conference

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,760
today thanks for doing what you do okay

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,600
and i'll be there thanks to the guys too

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
everyone watching today is here because

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,760
you have a connection to technology

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
we all do and tech can be exciting but

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
if we're honest we'll admit that the

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
open source world

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,040
is not as diverse as it could be the

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,040
history of technology is mainly a story

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
about men with few of those being men of

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
color

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,880
nothing is wrong with those guys doing

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
tech it's just that it's not a very

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
diverse picture

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
all this is true it helps to remember

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
that there were some women who were

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
trailblazers in tech and were great

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,959
leaders and great heroes

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,800
how about admiral grace hopper one of

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
the earliest computer programmers

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,720
there's also catherine johnson dorothy

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,959
vong and mary jackson who helped

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
nasa put astronauts into space you may

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
have seen their history in the movie

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
hidden figures role models may have been

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,959
rare but they did exist

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,560
that brings us to today where 95 percent

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,600
of text and open source are male and

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
only 16 percent

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
of our members of minority groups we do

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,760
have room to grow

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
when penguin corps started at our school

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
mr kirov and the school leaders wanted

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
to make sure

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
the door was open to all middle school

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
students could a middle school linux

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,839
club become my diverse place

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
the answer is yes that question had

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
already been answered by a club that

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
came before us

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,079
that club is the asian penguins a

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
community school of excellence in st

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,959
paul minnesota the asian penguins make a

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,040
deliberate effort to attract students of

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,519
diverse backgrounds in both boys and

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
girls

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,600
as a result it is multicultural and

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,519
their team is 30 to 50 percent girls in

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
any given year

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
the penguin gore is now in its second

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
year and i'm happy to report

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,040
the efforts have paid off as of right

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
now our team has 37 members

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
we have students who are

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,160
african-american biracial egyptian

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,440
ethiopian filipino ghanaian haitian

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,839
hispanic indian kenyan somali

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
tanzanian and white with a total of 15

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
girls

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,320
folks that's forty percent what

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
attracted all of these students to

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
penguin corp

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,600
we enjoy learning about the world that

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
is develop developing right in front of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
us

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
we learned that everyone can make a

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
change in the world that is still yet to

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
come

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,959
in penguin core we all work together as

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,160
a team we are united in a way that we

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,839
think everyone should be

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,519
we have a chance to make a bright future

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
for the world ahead of us so let's

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,040
embrace that chance

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,079
we have boys and girls deliver computers

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
to classrooms

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
boys and girls learn to install linux

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,199
and open source apps boys and girls

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
troubleshoot problems

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,040
we all help each other to embrace our

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,720
chance to change the world

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
now that the elementary kids see the

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,440
example we have set they know that

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,480
penguin core is for everyone and since

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
we all work together

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,680
we girls are always ready to offer the

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,600
boys a helping hand when they get stuck

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,279
if a kids club can be a diverse and

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
welcoming place why can't the rest of

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,880
open source world let's all invite

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,199
welcome recognize and respect

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,440
we are all human we are all equal and we

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,279
are all united in the open source world

00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:04,880
thank you very much now please welcome

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:07,199
jason philly

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,799
hi i'm jason philly a little over a year

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,559
ago i first heard about a type of quota

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,240
virus the kova 19

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,160
at the time he was making people sick in

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
other countries but i wasn't concerned

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
because

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
it wasn't where i lived here in

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,760
minnesota the march that had

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
changed a lot businesses were talking

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,600
about what they would what they needed

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,600
to do

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,360
to keep their stores clean and sanitary

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,000
and it raised the conversation

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,120
how would it affect schools fast forward

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
to march 18th

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
when all the schools of minnesota were

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,760
converted to distance learning

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
that's where teachers provided lessons

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,039
online and kids went to school in their

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,440
homes over the internet

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
it was a huge change while it was tough

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
going to school for my bedroom or dining

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
room

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
at least i had a computer to use but

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,760
what about the kids at school who didn't

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
have computers

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
or the families who didn't have enough

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,520
computers for all the kids in the house

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,039
what were they supposed to do so the

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
people in charge of our school reached

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,400
out to the penguin core

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
to create a solution the first thing we

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
needed to do was to survey parents so we

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
knew which families needed a computer

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,320
we used the information we collected and

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,760
got to work we started by putting linux

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
on computers the school didn't want

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
anymore so they could be given to

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
families who needed them

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,919
then we gave those away more responses

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
started to pour in

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,960
we realized that the supply we had would

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
not be even

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
close enough close to enough this became

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,520
a serious problem that was

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
in dire need of a bigger solution once

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
we realized that we started to ask for

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,640
more

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
mr kira from the school reached out over

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
social media and in the local

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
newspaper asking people to donate their

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
old computers to us

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
we used open source software to make

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
them usable again a whole bunch of

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
people and even some businesses

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,360
responded

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,960
laptops started to pour in most of them

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,160
worked but some needed minor repairs

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,080
such as new batteries

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,919
a charger or a hard drive all the

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,240
computers needed new software

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,200
linux and open source apps for the

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,280
solution

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
we got the computers up and running

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,919
tested them and left them at the school

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
to give away

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,440
the school continued to take referrals

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,960
and people came

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,880
in to pick up on laptops pick up laptops

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
jean the receptionist office the

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
receptionist in the office

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
joined our team by walking parents

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
through the software before they could

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
leave with their laptop

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,559
prior to the shutdown the beginning core

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
gave away six computers

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,799
from march 16th to the first week of may

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,280
it gave away 60 computers

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,720
this effectively closed the digital

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
divide we had at the time

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
as aspen used an asynchronous model for

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
classes

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,280
allowing siblings to share computers at

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
home it worked

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,799
aspen had intended to have face-to-face

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
instruction when school started in the

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,880
fall

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,640
but two days prior to our teachers

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
reporting back to work in august

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,320
we were told by the state that we had to

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
go hybrid with some kids coming to

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,000
school monday and tuesday and others

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,679
coming thursday and friday

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
when kids were at home they were to

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
attend classes online

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,039
also unlike in the spring aspen went

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
with synchronous classes

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,799
which meant that all students were

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,640
attending classes live at the same time

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
this meant that every student now needed

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
a device

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
this drove demand for computers way up

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
again we appealed online

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,520
and through social media to get

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
donations we also purchased used

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,080
computers from the minnesota surplus

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,840
exchange where we could get them cheaply

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
then the school started to hand them out

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,039
but it was a bigger job than anyone

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,280
could have predicted

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,600
at our open house on august 26th we

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,600
handed out 132 laptops

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
and it still wasn't enough we compiled

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
the waiting list and continued to work

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
on getting computers ready

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
giving them out on a steady stream over

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
the next few weeks finally on october

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
4th

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,559
we got to the last kid on our list we

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
had handed out 276 laptops and 31

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,159
desktops

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
what did this cost since we chose to use

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,240
computers instead of buying new ones

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,840
most of our costs were parts while we

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
mostly used donated computers

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
this time we did have to buy some from

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
the state but those were a fraction of

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
the cost of

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
new as right now our total cost for this

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
is still under

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,000
six thousand dollars we estimate that we

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,880
saved our school over ninety thousand

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
dollars

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
during this time other schools across

00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
the country struggled with supply line

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,799
problems

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,039
which delayed delivery of the computers

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,640
for months by using open source software

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,240
we closed our digital divide

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
helped our students and teachers and

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,480
saved a pile of money

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
it can be done thank you for listening

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,840
coming up next

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,840
coming up next is julia hoyt

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,039
hello my name is julia hood and i'm glad

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,799
you came

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
you've heard my friends talk about what

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,559
they like about penguin core

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
but they miss one of my favorite things

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
when you're in penguin car

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
every once in a while you get to skip

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
class of course you get

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,520
away with doing

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,000
with this open source stuff at school

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
means

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,840
that we have to convince our school

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,679
leaders that it's a good idea

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,200
this means that sometimes we have to

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,440
turn on the charm

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,039
i hope you're feeling persuasible you've

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
heard my team talk about

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,600
how we use open sources at school now i

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,840
like to talk about why

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,159
i would like to give you some reasons

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,679
why you should start a linux club

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,679
some of you might ask why do

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,600
schools need something like that or say

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,480
that's not the kind of thing for me

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,919
you believe any school can do this but

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,960
the school might need your

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
help let's talk about some reason the

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,600
program

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,840
is affordable you all have software

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
all the software is free and if you're

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
using old computers you don't have to

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
pay

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,360
a lot of money for them something else

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,240
to keep in mind people like

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,520
to help kids when they hear you're

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
running a club

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,840
that has kids recycling computers

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,600
they'll give you computers remember what

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,919
jason talked about

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
and when you're fundraising for a linux

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,799
club people like to give money to

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,159
support it

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:53,280
linux runs great on old computers we use

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,640
it to bring old computers back to life

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,360
this not only saves money but it reduces

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
e waste and last time i checked this

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,799
country

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
produces too much e-waste you get to

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,000
help people in

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,960
variety ways you help kids learn

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
in a linux club we learn how to do all

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,640
this stuff

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,360
we learn how to install software fix

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,679
computers

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,400
update and upgrade computers and all

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,520
sorts of

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
other skills these are our in-demand

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,600
skills

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,799
according to the 2018 open source job

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,159
reports from

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,880
the linux foundation 83

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,880
of hiring managers said that open source

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,000
talent was important to them

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,000
and 87 percent of them said it was hard

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,799
to find quality help

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
numbers like that speak for themselves

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,520
you

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,559
help people who are outside of the

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
school

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,600
if your school doesn't need computers

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,080
lots of your school

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
families probably do that was certainly

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,919
the case for

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,799
us and remember when you give an old

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,760
computer

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,520
uh to a kid you're helping a family too

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,640
you help the school itself

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,520
penguin core recycles enough

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,640
laptops to help hundreds of kids in

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,799
their homes

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,080
during distance learning and hybrid

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,360
learning now

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,159
we're back in the buildings we use those

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,720
laptops

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,400
to help several classrooms since the

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
those teachers have their own

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,120
laptop set and they don't need to check

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,840
out our school computer cards

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,039
leaving them for other teachers to use

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,679
we also provide

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,440
desktop computers to some classrooms and

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,640
even our media center

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,159
benefits everyone it's fun that should

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
be enough reasons for

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,640
anybody and when you recycle computers

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,840
or teaching at a conference you're not

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
in class

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,320
as you can see there are lots of reasons

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,880
why a school should have

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,279
an open source club it's affordable

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,600
people get help and kids have fun

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,799
and people three out there is not that

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
bad coming up

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,760
is shelby lamb thank you for listening

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,760
please consider yourself persuasive

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,700
[Applause]

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,320
hello i'm shelby lam open source out of

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
school is a relatively new thing but

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,559
it's already attracted a lot of

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
attention

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,240
unfortunately for most of those people

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,679
that's where it ends the reaction is

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
what happens at your school is great but

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
it has nothing to do with me well i'm

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,559
here to tell you that wasn't true when

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,279
we started last year and they aren't you

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,200
know

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,559
esmen academy did something special by

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,039
starting a linux club

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,120
but this is something any school can do

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
this includes schools near you

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,559
others are already using linux at school

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,799
the question is not

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,840
why does aspen academy use linux the

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,480
question is

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,320
how can you get involved where you are

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,440
we've come up with a few ideas to help

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,159
people get started with their very own

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,159
open source club wherever they are

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,559
whether that's a school community center

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,320
library or anywhere people get together

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,480
if julia did a job and

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,080
persuaded you here are some of the

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,400
things you'll need to get started

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,679
number one a supervisor that could

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
easily be you

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,600
it's not necessarily an expert you just

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,240
need to be willing to learn something

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,320
new

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
mr calf is a prime example when he

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,520
started the penguin core

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,960
he was a social science teacher he

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,600
didn't even have a tech job

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640
other people have started the same way

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
number two

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,320
the go ahead from administration each

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
school has a different way of doing

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,799
activities

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,720
how does your local school do it is it

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
after school does the school charge a

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
fee to its students

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,840
find out how it works there and put that

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,760
into your plan

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,919
more likely than not if that school has

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,400
clubs they are looking for more ideas

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
and for more adults to own them make

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,159
yourself available

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
number three computers if you're going

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440
to have kids

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
open source club you will need to have

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,880
computers for kids to use

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,400
they don't have to be new ones number

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,000
four software

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
your computers will need an operating

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,080
system and apps if you're using linux

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,200
then you're getting software for free

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,520
that helps number five kids

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,880
kids using open source is a whole point

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
of having a linux club

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,000
having the kids learning new stuff keeps

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,840
it fun number six space and time

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
a club will need a place to meet and to

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
keep it stuff and club activities will

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
have

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,720
to fit into that schedule work with the

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,320
local administration to figure that out

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,120
not sure how to get started well here's

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,159
how the first tip is to start small use

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,360
linux yourself

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,039
i'll bet most of you already do a couple

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,840
of resources you can use

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,720
would include flash desktops for kids

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,039
curriculum

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,159
from the open source initiative we use

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,039
some of their lessons

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,120
another is the linux club glide written

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,720
by our very own mr cast

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
the guide gives a lot of helpful

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,120
suggestions about how to get started

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,120
with the linux club and make it fun

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,120
it's available at www.linuxclubguide.com

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,960
the cook kids kids love tech and will

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,279
get excited about doing something new

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,039
with computers you've seen it happen

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,880
good computers this is easier than you

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,480
think remember they don't have to be new

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,080
many people and even some businesses

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,880
will want to give you computers for your

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,399
club

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,559
the school might have some they don't

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,799
need anymore if you're already

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,960
working in tech then work your own

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,799
contacts as many people you know might

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,640
have old computers laying around

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,919
and there are plenty of places to get

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,000
computers cheaply

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,240
state governments and universities often

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
sell computers they don't need anymore

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
and there are thrift stores free geek

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,120
tech dump and ebay

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,440
we've gotten computers from all these

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,919
sources and so can you

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,360
do software and hardware lessons using

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,039
stuff from a curriculum

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,360
tips you see online i simply make

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,919
something up there's nothing wrong with

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,240
working

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,960
right alongside your kids remember if

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,360
you really screw something up you can

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
grab a install drive and start ink all

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
over

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
with free software you're free to do

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,080
that as option as you want our biggest

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
project became a school's digital divide

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
and we closed it

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
maybe that is what your local school

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,760
needs the formula is simple

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,080
open source software plus used computers

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,399
plus

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,000
enthusiastic kids equals more students

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,840
learn it works

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
this isn't just about having fun it's

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,799
about making a difference do you want to

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,039

we would love to have folks uh ask

oh okay age range of the the students

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,520
that are with me today

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,360
um uh are the youngest on this team was

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,720
quinn who's a fifth grader quinn how old

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,000
are you

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,600
he's okay he's 11. and then and then the

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,240
oldest one was shelby

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,000
who is an eighth grader shelby you're

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,679
what 13 14.

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,240
13. um we have of our middle school

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
disco and this is a little bit unusual

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,519
compared to

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,559
some other schools but ours starts at

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,080
fifth grade

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
it goes up through eighth grade so it's

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,360
four grades so we'll have kids in the

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,519
program

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,960
as young as 10 and then as old as 14.

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,120
uh and um yeah so that we have a

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
sort of a wide variety of of ages but

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,080
we're we're getting

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,360
started kind of young here but uh

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
they're doing it so

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,360
you know there's nothing to complain

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,279
about definitely so nice

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,720
so you have like um up to two questions

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,760
so should i read it out

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,840
yeah please yeah okay okay so um

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,480
there's a question here said this is an

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,720
excellent program which i totally agree

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
um what were the highlights of repairing

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,039
the computers

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,640
follow-up did you get to meet or any of

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,080
the recipients of their

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,519

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,559
up like very easy okay

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,679
um actually okay uh highlights of

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,919
repairing computers

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,720
guys when you when you're working on the

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
computers

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
what are the bits that you like the best

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,279
like uh you help kids also get computers

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,200
and

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,320
you get to upgrade them so they're

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,080
really fun

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,919
upgrading and um turning it into linux

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,600
okay so like when you guys are in the

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,000
lab what do you guys like to do

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,320
dom do you want to answer that one uh

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,039
learning new uh commands to put into the

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,640
terminal

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,640
a terminal oh yeah

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,559
okay so guys how many of you here like

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,960
using the terminal window

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,360
there they go oh yeah yeah that's uh

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,440
that's a huge favorite among these guys

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,039
so yeah um that's really great

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,519
okay now um now did the group get to

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,559
meet

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,679
any of the recipients of the computers

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,720
um actually yes um this

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,399
is because of cobit 19 this was a really

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,120
really strange year

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,559
when we first started doing this we

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,559
tried to

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
um we tried to maintain it like a

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
certain level of confidentiality

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,519
regarding who was receiving the

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,600
computers because you know we

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,840
we wanted to make sure that that we were

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,840
respecting families privacy and stuff

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,600
then all of a sudden our school got shut

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,720
down because of a virus

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,200
and dozens of families needed them at

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,679
first

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,120
so all of a sudden people start coming

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
out of the woodwork i think

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,840
everybody here knows somebody who

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,320
received one of our computers right

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,279
okay raise your hand if you know a

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,679
person who received a computer from us

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,320
okay all right second question raise

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,919
your hand

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,320
if you are one of those kids that

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,360
received a computer from us

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,760
yeah when um uh

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,760
in the fall and this was something that

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,799
uh that both uh i believe layton and

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,480
shelby

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,399
talked about when uh oh and jason you

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,200
talked about this a lot in your talk

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,240
we when we we got shut down due to covet

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,839
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,040
um we kids in the in the spring could

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,520
share computers

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,760
uh so we didn't have to worry as much

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,440
about every kid having one

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,040
but then in the fall um every kid needed

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
a computer and then all of a sudden it

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,000
wasn't

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,599
a few dozen students needing computer it

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,720
was a few hundred

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,560
uh so that's what

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,960
that's close to half our school our

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,520
school population is about 650

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,359
and over 300 of our kids got a computer

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,440
from us i mean so that's

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,040
uh so i think everybody in here if you

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,839
didn't use one of our computers you know

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
somebody who did

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,879
that's like that's really great so

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,880
there's our second

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:04,000
question um walter asked it sounds like

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,640
linux is the primary os in your school

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,640
is that correct is it used by

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,160
administration as well

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,640
believe it or not uh the uh the answer

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,240
to

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,880
both questions is no um

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,480
linux is a really recent phenomenon here

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,720
they had never heard of it prior to

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,160
september 2019

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,200
um but all of a sudden the circumstances

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,560
made us a bigger deal here than we had

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,000
anticipated

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,119
um the the primary os that's used

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,839
here at the school by students would

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,000
still be

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,240
uh chrome os uh because of the

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,960
chromebooks that students are using

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,599
uh by the administration and the

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,640
teachers

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,079
they're all issued a windows computer i

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
think you guys all know i don't really

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,079
use mine all that much

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,280
yeah they gave me one yeah it's it's

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,720
like sitting over there

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,200
it's closed it hasn't been on all day um

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,760
but uh but believe it or not those are

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,000
the primary os's now as far as linux

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,640
being used at school though

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,440
that is growing and it's largely growing

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,839
because

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,280
we're not doing full distance or hybrid

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,680
learning anymore

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,079
so the kids who needed a computer from

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,160
us to attend school at home

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,119
they're now back in school so those

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,200
families have been

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,079
returning the computers and because we

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,640
had we had set this up as a loan program

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,359
this time around and the reason for that

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,599
was

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,839
if we gave them a computer it was oh

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,839
well good luck tell us how it works out

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,000
but if we're loaning them and

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,599
you know the expectation is is that

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,680
we're also supporting it

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
if something goes wrong we're on the

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,640
hook to replace it and help that family

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
out

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,400
um and but since those computers are

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,640
coming back now

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
we're as fast as we can we're getting

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,119
them out to classrooms

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,320
uh let's see here i've got some

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,839
mr hergot has some all of fourth grade

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,920
has some

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,960
all third grade has who who delivered

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,599
him to fourth grade and third grade

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
anybody here

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,000
do that do you have you did yep okay

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,920
all right so um and the next thing is

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,520
um we want to get some more in the

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,760
middle school because we

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,760
we still have a number of computers that

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,520
are waiting to be reprocessed so we can

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
get them ready for a classroom

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,280
and i think language arts is next on the

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
list so we'll we'll get one to one of

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,960
the english teachers

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,040
let's see here i want to congratulate

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,800
you on combining helping your students

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
to learn to develop their public

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,240
speaking skills as part of this

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,200
presentation so hey that's off to you

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,160
guys that's cool

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,760
all right uh this is another skill they

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,920
will continue to benefit

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,680
them into the future on top of the

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,560
technical skills they are learning

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,200
this is coming from a tech for 25 plus

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,280
years

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,200
who has to train new employees on a

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,359
bi-weekly basis

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,960
so somebody who's actually out there is

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,400
applauding what you guys are doing

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,000
right now and he's been doing it for

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,760
over 25 years

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,920
okay all right okay

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,320
has the success of the program and the

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,880
use of of linux by students

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,400
impacted the school's use adoption by

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,839
faculty administration

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,920
etc uh suffice to say we're seeing a

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,520
whole lot more students and a whole lot

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,560
more people in the building

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,040
learning more about this than we ever

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,160
really

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,640
pictured um as far as the

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,240
the staff uh not so much with the

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,200
administration they're they're thrilled

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,960
they just don't use it

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,119
uh you know they're just happy to see it

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
going on with the staff a few of them

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,359
are starting to pick up a few things

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,880
here and there

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,280
but the thing that really caught me off

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,760
guard is these kids would then turn

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,000
around

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,400
and they would show things to their

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,680
friends who aren't in the club

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,720
and so i i don't know if other teachers

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,280
of

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,760
fifth grade students uh can comment to

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,880
this

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,280
but i've actually seen kids

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,320
on the desktop computer they keep in the

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,079
back my room

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,680
teaching each other how to do terminal

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,200
tricks and stuff like that

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,200
that normally doesn't happen in a fifth

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,720
grade classroom i can yeah but uh it

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,280
does here

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,440
uh let's see here what linux flavor

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,359
distribution is the most popular one

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,480
in the computers you give to families

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,520
excellent question

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,760
yep we use zubuntu which of course is a

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,800
variant of ubuntu that uses the

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,200
the xfce desktop and the reason that we

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,400
use

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,240
that is because it was uh low graphics

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
requirements and so it was easier on a

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,880
lot of the older hardware we've been

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,800
using

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,400
um now personally if you know if you're

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,760
watching my desktop on this

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,920
uh i i use ubuntu on my own computer but

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,160
we use a lot of zubuntu here and it's

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,920
it's worked out pretty good however we

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,280
uh in penguin core we do

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,040
one lesson every season called distro

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,720
hopping where kids can run

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,320
uh their choice live from a flash drive

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,240
and if they're quick enough they get to

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,920
try out two or three during that lesson

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,079
so a lot of kids really get into that

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,880
just to try out different things

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,839
uh let's see here are there shareable

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,240
resources

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,680
who would like to start this program in

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,599
their local communities

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,720
a tutorial on how to start their own

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
penguin core

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,760
i am glad you asked in fact i am going

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,440
to

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,040
um let's see here of course i'm nowhere

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,359
near my keyboard um

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,880
if this was something that shelby

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,680
brought up in her talk

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,319
um i actually wrote and published an

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,440
online

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,920
guide to help anybody who wants to do

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,760
this particularly schools

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,400
because i believe that any school could

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,920
do this however

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
it could be a church it could be a

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,400
mosque it could be a temple a library

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
it doesn't matter and if you go to

00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:49,440
www.linuxclubguide.com

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,760
you'll see all sorts of tips on how to

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,319
get

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
your club up and running the guide is

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,920
available

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,119
for free and we would love to see more

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
people using it

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,520
and these guys okay uh today's t-shirt

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,640
days you can see we just got our

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,160
t-shirts in

okay um if anybody is interested

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,359
in starting their own linux club and

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,839
they want to call it

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,720
a penguin core but want to stick their

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,240

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,599
school in there um we're not charging

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,040

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,480
somebody come alongside us

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,560

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
with uh the the line where the school

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,760
appears blank so you can insert your own

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,880
school into it

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,800
so yeah you want our logo yeah knock

um if you if you want to contribute to

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,720

um and the you know the things that

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,760
we're trying to do at our school because

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,240
part of kind of like you know phase two

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
for us

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,720
once we get past covet is to try to help

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,000
other schools in the area

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,480
who want to start their program but um

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,839
don't know how to get going so you know

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
as soon as we can start doing field

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,800
trips we

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,160
might see us loading up a bus and taking

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,000
them out to another school

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,440
but if you want to help us as

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,520
particularly if you

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,040
live or work in the upper midwest in the

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,960
united states

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,960
we'll always take another used computer

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
particularly if it is in that gently

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,640
used

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,319
category um we you know

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,560
right now uh right now we do have

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,839
a bit of a surplus and we're happy about

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,640
that but that's not going to last

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,599
forever

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,119
because as soon as we get down to as

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,720
soon as we take care of

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,040
the english department in the middle

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,920
school and possibly science and get down

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,520
to second grade

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,400
we will be out so um if people want to

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,720
