Description: 
	Jeff Luszcz, Director of Open Source at PEAK6, delivered the extended (90 minutes) session "Just Enough Open Source: A kick start on security, license compliance, and business models" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Open Source powers the world, but you need to do more than download it

In this talk, we will provide background on the most common types of open source licenses, business models, security issues, and most importantly the processes required to help you remain secure and in compliance. We will discuss best practices, scanning tools, remediation, customer and partner expectations around OSS compliance, and how to manage OSS during events such as a product release or M&A.
