Title: Just Enough Open Source: A kick start on security, license... - Jeff Luszcz - PEAK6 - OS101
Publication date: 2021-04-10
Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Jeff Luszcz, Director of Open Source at PEAK6, delivered the extended (90 minutes) session "Just Enough Open Source: A kick start on security, license compliance, and business models" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Open Source powers the world, but you need to do more than download it

In this talk, we will provide background on the most common types of open source licenses, business models, security issues, and most importantly the processes required to help you remain secure and in compliance. We will discuss best practices, scanning tools, remediation, customer and partner expectations around OSS compliance, and how to manage OSS during events such as a product release or M&A.

thanks everybody who's joining us today

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,040
as amber said my name is jeff lush and

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm here to talk about just enough open

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,920
source a kickstart on security

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
license compliance and business models

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,880
this is going to be a two-part session

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
so we're going to be going to about half

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,800
past the hour for the first section

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,439
take about a 15-minute break and then

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,279
come back for the second half

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,719
hope you can join us for both pieces a

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,200
little bit about myself my name is jeff

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
lush

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,239
i have been involved with open source

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
since the 1990s

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,000
got my start doing scientific software

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
got involved with

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
kind of gcc licensing and library

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,360
licensing way back in the 90s

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,559
and that got me involved with kind of

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
all things open source

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,920
i started a company back in 2004 called

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
palamida

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
it was one of the first companies to do

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,359
basically scanning and management of

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
open source software

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,399
i've built compliance programs i've

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,080
worked professional

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
services teams to help implement those

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
programs and i've helped companies both

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
small

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
and large kind of manage their use of

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
open source manage their use of

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,119
commercial software

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,200
do mergers and acquisitions due

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
diligence all the things that

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
kind of shine a light on people's use of

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
open source and commercial code

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
i'm now working in a company called

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
peak6 where i'm their director of open

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
source

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
and really hope you can enjoy the talk

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,759
today

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
um today's agenda we're going to talk a

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,479
little bit in the first half around open

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
source licenses

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,960
so what are they what are they what do

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
they mean what's important about them

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,119
we'll talk about compliance which means

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
how do you use open source correctly and

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
commercial code correctly

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
we'll then get into security and talk

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
about the kind of security events that

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
you might find in your open source as

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
well as your commercial software

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
how do you fix them what are their

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
customer expectations and a little bit

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
about scanning and tooling

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
and then lastly we'll get to best

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
practices so how do you work with

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
suppliers

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,240
how do you can become compliant uh

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
educate the folks that are working at

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,520
your company

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
remediation which means fix and some

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
things about the future

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,039
where's licensing going and what should

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
we be paying attention to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,440
so let's first talk about why we need

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,959
open source licenses

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,319
i think we're all very familiar with

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,160
commercial licensing you know if you

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,840
have a phone if you have a laptop

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
you almost certainly have gone out and

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
bought a bought a

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
an app from the app store you've paid

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
your 99 cents you've clicked i agree

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
continue or you've installed some

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
commercial software at work and you

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
understand that there's some document

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
that says

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
if you do this you can use the software

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
if you pay us money you can

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
you can use the software that's kind of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
the classic commercial licensing story

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
well open source is not commercial in

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
the sense of

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,840
uh does not expect you to pay money to

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,879
get to get the library or to get the

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
application

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
but it still has obligations that you

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,440
need to follow

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
and the main driver of this is that we

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
we use copyright law to kind of control

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
access or allow

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
access to people's apps or movies or

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
sounds or books or pretty much anytime

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
you put pen to paper or your fingers to

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,680
the keyboard

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,720
you make something that is controlled by

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
copyright

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,239
and the way the copyright law works in

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
in most countries is

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
that you need explicit permission to use

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
somebody else's work and there are some

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
exclusions for things like

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
uh fair use and whatnot but for the most

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,879
part for our day-to-day

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
if we're working at a company you you

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
probably should expect to get explicit

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
permission

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
to use somebody else's thing whether

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,920
it's an app or source code or

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
an icon image or whatever and how we

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
give permission is something called a

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
license

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
talked about commercial licensing open

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
source is the same thing

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
but for open source projects it's going

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
to give you permission

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
to use that resource as long as certain

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
obligations are fulfilled

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
so if you're willing to do a b c and d

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
the open source

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
author says great you can use my you can

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
use my library you can use my source

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,439
code whatever it is

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
we write up these licenses these

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,239
agreements

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
and in the commercial world you find

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,799
very often that the commercial licenses

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
are one-offs

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
every time you sign up for a different

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
commercial product you got a different

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
license

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
you got to root your lawyers look at it

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,079
you look at it and say okay this looks

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
good to us the open source world what we

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,960
figured out a while ago is

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
it it's best to have some very common

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
licenses

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,360
that we don't have to read each single

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
line of code each and every time

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
to understand what the obligations are

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,720
and so we reuse these and we give them

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
names

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
so you might know some famous open

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
source licenses like the general public

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,320
license or the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
bsd license and the idea is if we reuse

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
them

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,919
it makes a lot easier we don't have this

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,280
kind of friction

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
about using a new library

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
well let's talk about some of the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
obligations so when you use open source

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
there is a series of obligations that

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
you may find

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,280
that you need to follow there may be no

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
there may be no obligations whatsoever

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
the license might just say do whatever

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,880
you want with this i don't care

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
but in general if you're using open

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
source library

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
there is a series of one or more

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
obligations that might be as simple as

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
just saying

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
i'm not going to sue you if i use this

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
and something wrong happens that's a

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,759
disclaimer

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,000
there might be a requirement or an

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,560
obligation to keep the copyright

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,919
notices in the source code or to put

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
them in something like you're in about

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,960
box or your documentation

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,280
um also you'll see that there may be an

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,199
obligation to share source code

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
that's a concept called copyleft and

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
we'll talk about that in a little bit

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
that's kind of a pun

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
on the word copyright but the idea of

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
copy left

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
is that there's an expectation or

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
obligation to share

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,520
either part of your source code or all

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
of your source code

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
under certain circumstances with your

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
users or the people you distribute your

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
product to

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,039
and while this last one is not a open

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,039
source it's by its very definition not

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
an open source obligation

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,960
it's very often mentioned when we're

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,800
talking about licensing around

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,479
open source or software which is now

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,479
more and more these business model

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
restrictions the idea is if you use this

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,240
code

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,080
you may not be able to do a b c and d

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
and again that's not explicitly open

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
source

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
it's like it's contrary to open source

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
model

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,840
but it often is adjacent and i think

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
it's important to talk about things that

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,039
are adjacent to open source licensing in

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
these talks

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
and obviously some of these obligations

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
are going to be a lot easier to comply

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
with than others you know the obligation

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
to do

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
nothing is a lot easier than an

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,319
obligation to say give away all your

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
source code

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
i'm not going to walk through all of the

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
items here

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,319
but what you will find is that there are

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
multiple obligations that may be

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
present there's some very very common

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,960
ones and there's going to be some more

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,360
uncommon ones as well so we we've talked

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
about like the obligation to pay money

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
that's a classic commercial obligation

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,479
um share source code that's the copyleft

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,880
share credit which means maybe preserve

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
notices or give credit in about boxes

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
but there's other other obligations that

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,560
you may find as well like

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,639
around patents so if you are at a

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,039
company or a project that is dealing

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,360
with

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,479
patents patent content video audio

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
software you may find that there is an

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
obligation

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
to give basically free access to your

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
patents required to run that software or

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
vice versa

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,039
if you sue someone around patents there

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,520
may be a retaliation clause which means

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,520
you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
lose access to that open source library

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
if you sue other people

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
these are fairly complicated and

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,039
definitely involve

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,479
a lot of legal talent to understand i

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
bring these up because it is

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
it is important to understand what

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,560
you're allowed and not allowed to do

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
in certain fields of use when you are

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
using open source or commercial code as

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
well you may find

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
similar obligations in the commercial

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,280
libraries you're pulling in as well

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
one thing you'll see is a term of art

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,800
you might hear is a vanity license

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,879
those are very often rare licenses they

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
may be famous but they may be rare

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
and they require some non-traditional

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
action again these may or may not be

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
official open source

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
licenses under the open source

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,240
definition but you'll find it as you you

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,960
download code and go through code

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
reviews and

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,319
these may be things like the buy me a

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,520
beer if this helps you license the free

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
beer license or

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
a do no evil license or get vaccinated

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
license

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,919
these licenses these vanity licenses are

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,919
often good for a laugh

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,199
but sometimes cause some annoyance when

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,360
you are um

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
trying to do a legal review or uh get

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
clearance for

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,560
um kind of sharing your software or

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,560
using your software

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,399
um i will i will tell you that typically

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,640
these these licenses take

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,640
more more legal time to review than

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
those common licenses that we we talk

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,560
about um

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
like the general public license or the

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,040
mit license because because the lawyers

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
have never seen that before and they

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
need to go through

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,480
them bind by line and understand what

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,399
the impacts to your organization is

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
so i think it's important to go and look

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,760
at the history of licensing because it

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,440
helps us understand

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
what the world is now you know if you

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
study history you can definitely

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
understand why we

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,760
do what we do now and also what the

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,399
future may hold for us

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,519
so if we go back to the the mid 1980s

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,160
that's really where the

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
the modern open source licensing world

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
started

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
there's always been shared source

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,640
there's always been software that's been

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
available

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
but i would i would say the modern open

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
source licensing world started in the

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,800
mid 80s where we had the x11

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,760
also known as the mit license up here

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,680
the bsd license a couple years later

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,800
and then on the other side of the house

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,959
the gpl the general public licenses

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
and uh what you'll find is the two

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,839
philosophies of open source

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,720
um really got started then as well kind

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,040
of the x11 mit bsd philosophy of

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
sharing sharing credit and giving notice

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
you know i'm using this software or

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
preserve these copyright statements in

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,440
the source versus

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,200
the share your source code the copy left

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
idea like the general public license or

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
the lgpl license

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,800
and what's amazing is we kind of got the

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,600
licensing right back then

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,360
in the 80s and early 90s we still used

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,120
these licenses pretty much almost as

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
written back then in our day-to-day

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,680
the dot-com boom uh the kind of the

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
internet appeared around the year 2000

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
plus or minus

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
and one thing that's interesting there

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,680
is we started to see

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
a lot more kind of business interest in

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,519
open source and a lot more

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
kind of corporate attitudes around

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
making sure that there's all the proper

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,079
definitions and the legal agreements

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
that they're signing and

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,360
you'll notice that the licenses got

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
longer and started talking about things

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,839
like patents and

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,680
and what's the definition of a

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,959
contractor and all these things but

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
basically same idea

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
you know very similar concepts about how

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,959
to use and share source code

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
um appeared there and now we're here in

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,000
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and the the world is changing again

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
uh we're on the cusp of the new open

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
source era and if you look and

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,959
and kind of look back in time you'll see

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,000
that the licenses of each era

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,440
kind of get defined by the the universe

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
that people were building software and

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
sharing software

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
back then so in the the 80s it was

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
really kind of about workstations and

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,160
desktops

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,760
so you know the beginnings of the

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
internet but really that was around

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
sharing

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
files and not sharing services and so

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
very much about

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
the 80s was here's i want i want access

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
to the source code and i want to be able

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,880
to understand the permissions

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,959
but it was really about kind of

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,200
the beginnings of the open source world

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,720
in the 2000s where we really saw kind of

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
the corporate interest

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
and the linux world appear and we see

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,240
the longer licenses and the kind of the

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,399
beginnings of

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
of talking about how licensing in the

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,480
cloud era might occur

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
but now we're in what i call the cloud

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,399
era basically we're starting to see

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,600
less about distributing products

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,680
say on a device or a download

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,320
and more about providing cloud services

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
or website services or apis

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
we're seeing some new licenses that may

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
not be open source but are

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
open source adjacent like the commons

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,959
clause and the server side public

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
license and

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,399
i'll talk about those in a little bit

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
but i i think what's

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
kind of of interest here is that there

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
is a new world of licensing

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,240
um appearing right now and it's unclear

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
where where it's going to end up but i

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,880
think it's important to understand

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
what's what's going on and i have a

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,360
couple slides later on about that

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
so let's talk about the style of

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
licensing um as i mentioned before

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
there there seems to be two main

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,920
philosophies

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,000
in the open source world uh

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
and you will see that there is a million

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,760
terms for these and sometimes people

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,200
will get caught up about oh it's this

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,120
it's not that or i can't believe you

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
called it this instead of that

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
i think it's important to respect the

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,079
communities and understand the

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
communities but also sometimes clarity

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
about talking about these things is

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,920
helpful as well so

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,480
the first the first type of open source

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,279
that we see is what some people call

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
permissive sometimes people call those

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
attribution or notice licenses or

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,839
academic licenses there's a lot of names

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
for these

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
but the general idea is they require

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,040
preserving or supplying the copyright

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,920
notices and or the license text

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,839
if you use or distribute these products

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
some good examples are like the bsd

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
license the mit license the apache

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,279
license

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,079
and they may have different levels of

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,959
sharing of that

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,240
credit that you need to pass on the

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,399
other side of the coin

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
is the copyleft style sometimes called

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,560
reciprocal or

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
viral licenses and the idea here is that

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,240
you

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,279
need to you need to supply all or some

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
of the source code

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,240
of your program under certain conditions

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
and we'll talk about what those

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,440
conditions are in a little bit

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
so let's talk about the permissive

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
licenses so the kind of classics that

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
are here

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,000
are the apache licenses the bsd licenses

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
and the mit licenses and there's many

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,560
other licenses

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,560
um that have these requirements and and

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
even the copyleft licenses will have

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,000
some of these notice requirements and

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,040
license requirements but the heart of it

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the apache bsd and mit licenses really

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
what their their

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
their goal is is to give credit where

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
credit is due

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,959
make sure that if you're distributing a

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,199
product based on these

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,440
preserve the copyright text and in many

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,680
cases pass along the license text to

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
your users

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,600
and that's what we call the notices so

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,680
when you're doing open source compliance

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
and you're talking about are you in

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
compliant with these licenses

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
very often people are going to say do

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,279
have you produced the notices

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
file or the notices for the libraries

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,560
that you're using

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
and these may appear in a couple

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,279
different places these may be in your

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
about box

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,320
so if you have a mobile phone uh

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
you can go and go to your kind of

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,360
general settings legal settings

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,040
and see page after page of license text

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,279
if you are on your desktop and you

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
go to the about box in many of the

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,839
desktop apps

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
you're using you'll again you'll find

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
sometimes it'll say open source notices

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,639
or legal notices

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,880
and again pages and pages of of open

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,160
source license text will appear there

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,880
um classic classic case is putting

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,000
things in the open

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,399
about box or legal info

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,560
many of the licenses also may say please

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
put this in your documentation so you

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,560
may open up the big pdf

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
and see at the end of the pdf of the the

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,800
user manual there may be the open source

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
notices and again page after page of

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,320
license text

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
kind of positioned or dumped there and

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
then obviously

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,759
in the source code world it's important

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,759
to preserve

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
the license text that's in the code that

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,920
you received it's actually a very big

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,759
no-no if you are stripping out license

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,720
text or removing license files from the

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
code that you receive

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
so on the other side we talked about the

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,160
copy left or the viral licenses

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,240
reciprocal licenses

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
there's kind of three main licenses that

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
you'll see there

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
um the lgpl the lesser general public

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
license

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,759
the general public license and the

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,040
affairo general public license

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,720
these are kind of a spectrum

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
you'll see that they'll be defined very

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,120
often as a weak copy left

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
strong copy left and a network copy left

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,600
and the idea there is that

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
for the weak copy left you need to give

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
away

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,320
some of the source code typically the

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,079
source code that's inside the library

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
that you you kind of downloaded and

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,279
brought in

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,800
the strong copy left the idea is to

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,160
preserve to

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,480
pass along the source code for the

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,880
entire application that's linked

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,880
and then the the network copy left is

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
for the new world of kind of cloud

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,639
services where if you build a product

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
and you're depending on say

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
a gpl license code there are certain

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,519
circumstances where you may be

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,800
um obligated to pass along the source

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,240
code for your web your web app

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
through the network and we'll talk a

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,720
little bit about the specifics there

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
so when you talk about open source

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,279
licensing very often there's a

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
discussion around

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,759
linking especially if you're building

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,000
something like an iot device or a

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,799
desktop app or a

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
linux app the question of linking comes

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
up

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,799
and the reason why this is so important

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
is because some of the open source

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,839
licenses

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
come into effect based on how you

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
combine

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,360
the libraries or the source code

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
together that's called linking

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,600
the idea in the computer science world

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,760
is you bring in a library

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,960
and sorry you bring in a library

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,039
and you see how i'm sorry there's a

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,200
question about closed captioning here

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,360
um the idea with linking is you bring in

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
a library and you combine it with code

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,200
that you write and you you

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
combine it with code that other people

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,240
have written the various libraries

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
you've downloaded the various source

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
code you've written you've mixed it all

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
together into your application

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,440
you link it all together and that's what

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,960
makes your final app and the lgpl

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,480
the lesser general public license came

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
out in a time where

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
people said you know from a free

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
software open source perspective

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
hey let's make sure that our libraries

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,679
are super high quality

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,039
and if people are making improvements to

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,400
those libraries we want those

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,240
improvements to be shared with the

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
community in the world and so the

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
licensing there is

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,240
let's let's not worry about what's in

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
the app that you're writing but if you

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,919
do make any improvements to the library

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,640
that you're pulling in or the under

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
the lgpl license you give it back to the

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
community if you if you are distributing

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
your app

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,880
out there you're putting it on an app

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,480
store allowing it for download or giving

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
it to customers

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
and this is the concept of weak copy

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
left is

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,360
improve the library components that you

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,640
bring in that are under weak copyleft

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,440
licenses

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
and there are some specifics if you link

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
it this way or you'll link it that way

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
there are definitely some specifics

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
where

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
um the licensing might get more

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,200
complicated and this is where you bring

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
in your open source

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
uh lawyers and i am not a lawyer so

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,600
don't take this as legal advice but

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
the general idea is understand your

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
linking and understand the licensing

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,840
that you're using

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
so that you can respect the community

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,960
and not have to fix things

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,240
after the fact the general public

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
license on the other hand

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,640
says comes from the idea of all source

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
codes should be shared

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
and if you're building an application

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,320
and you pulled in a library or a chunk

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,679
of source code under a viral

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,679
or a copyleft license the idea is

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,039
you found this software useful we think

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
the whole universe should

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,039
find your software useful and your user

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,000
should have the ability to examine your

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,559
source code

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
and so the code for both what you wrote

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
and the code that you brought in from

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,240
the open source world

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
should be available and shared and

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,080
that's the idea of strong copyleft

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
and this typically comes into effect if

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,000
you are distributing your app

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
so like if your app is going on an app

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,520
store or you're delivering it to your

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
customers

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
um the the concept of copy left is going

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
to be

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,520
likely in effect for your for your app

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,720
if you're not distributing it say you're

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
if you're putting it out there as a

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
website

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
you may not find yourself having to have

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
any

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,240
gpl for example compliance requirements

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
but if you change your business model if

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
you start distributing that app to

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,799
somebody you may suddenly find yourself

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,320
with a gpl problem for yourself so it's

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,600
really important to understand

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,520
how your application is being

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
distributed and also what your future

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,039
plans

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,480
for that app may be so again

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,000
understanding how it's linked

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,039
understanding what the licensing is

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
coming in and understanding your

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,919
business model is very important

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,760
and then lastly in the copyleft world

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,600
there's the afero general public license

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,080
this was a license that came out

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
kind of in the in the 2000s and the idea

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,159
is hey we know we're living in a cloud

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
world

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,159
we know that the idea of shipping

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,760
software distributing software around

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,440
is changing um yes you have apps yes you

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,240
may be downloading

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,919
enterprise software but so much of the

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
software that people are using day after

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,799
day after day is is access to the

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,200
website

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,880
and that is not traditionally seen as a

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
distribution

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,120
of that like the lgpl or the gpl

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,720
licenses cared about

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
and so the the open source community

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,200
made a new license

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
to to address this use case and this is

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
what's called a

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,880
network copy left license and there are

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
some legal complexities there and i

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
think some of the licensing is still a

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
little

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,600
unclear for folks so in general if

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,919
you're if you're in the cloud world

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
and you find yourself using a gpl

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,880
licensed software i think that is a

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
perfect time to bring your

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
your your legal counsel in to understand

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,679
how you're using it and how that

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,720
software may

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,360
affect uh your use you're just you're

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,000
basically

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,440
the the compliance of your product

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,480
you'll sometimes hear people call the

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,120
asp

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
loophole to the gpl as a thing to

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
discuss

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
and the idea there was that since um the

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,679
gpl

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,960
does not typically come into effect if

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,159
you're just providing something through

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,000
a website

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
uh a lot of folks in the open source

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
community said hey we we want open

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480
source to have licensing that is um

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,000
you know visible and aware of this new

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
cloud world and that's where the agpl

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
came in

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,960
i will say the agpl has not been a very

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,440
popular license compared to say

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
gpl or other licenses but when you do

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,080
see it it's very important to account to

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,919
understand

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,240
what's going on the copyleft licenses

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,679
that you may see day to day the agpl

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,320
the gpl the lgpl another one

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,080
sleepy cat which is a license associated

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,080
with a very popular open source

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,200
library database called the sleepy cat

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,720
database or berkeley db database

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
and also one that you will probably see

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
almost every day but not even realize it

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
is a

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,240
is a license called the creative commons

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,480
sharealike

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,880
ccsa this is a license associated with

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,000
the stack overflow

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,000
forums where people share code samples

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,520
and it's a little bit of a compliance

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
problem for for companies because the

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,200
code samples are licensed under this

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
what's seen as a copy left license

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
but the first thing people do is they

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,600
take that code and they cut and paste it

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
into their apps

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,919
that shouldn't have copy left code in it

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,320
and we'll talk a little bit about that

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,320
later but that's a very common headache

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
for folks which is there's this kind of

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,679
strong copyleft license

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,200
that uh people do not

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
are unaware of that it's a copyleft

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
license and then find themselves later

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,679
on trying to rip it out

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,360
or re-license that code some of the

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
other weak copyleft licenses like the

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,360
lgpl or the eclipse public license

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,159
very common to see especially in certain

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,320
communities like the java community

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,880
for some of the libraries that are there

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,720
again those are about sharing the fixes

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
to the libraries themselves as opposed

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,520
to the

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,320
entire application that you build for

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,760
the week copy left

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440
so let's talk a little bit more about

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,799
copyleft

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,559
the idea here is that you're supposed to

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,840
be sharing source code

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,679
um and so some source code may need to

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,760
be shared or all of your source code

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
may be shared and i think it's important

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,120
from a compliance perspective if you are

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,080
using any copy left style libraries it's

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
important to

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,559
record that source code someplace you

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
know typically inside a git or one of

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,600
your

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
your code your course code storage

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,720
mechanism

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
because it's really hard after the fact

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,080
to go to try to find

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,120
the exact source code that you need to

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
comply with

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
so in the future somebody might come to

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,039
you and say i love your app

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,159
thanks so much for it and i would like

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,360
the

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,120
code for the copy left libraries that

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,960
this app depends on

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
and for many of these licenses you have

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
that obligation to

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
give a source bundle i mean you know zip

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,960
file or tarball

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,480
are common um words for that archive

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
that you basically would pass on to the

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,400
people asking for that

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
and it's hard after the fact it's it's

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,240
like kind of somebody saying hey can you

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
find this document from 1997

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,000
way after the fact the best time to

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,600
record this is when your developers

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
actually go out and download that

00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
library

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,520
they might be downloading like the

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,400
compiled version of it

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,080
uh like through a jar file or a dll but

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
the best time to store that copyleft

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,360
code away is

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,559
that exact moment so it's a good policy

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,480
to have for your developers

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,799
is for have them also download the

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,480
source code and store that away so

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,400
your compliance in the future will be a

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
lot easier and i think that's important

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
even if you don't find yourself under

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,640
current copyleft

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,919
obligations it is websites disappear all

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
the time and even with great

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
services like the internet archive you

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
should be in control

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
of the code that you depend on and it's

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,320
important to have it

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,400
in your systems because if you can't

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,720
find it in the future the onus is still

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,559
on you to be able to provide it

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
another term that might you will hear is

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,840
corresponding source

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,600
and kind of the general idea is it's the

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,799
source code but it may also include

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
things like the build scripts the

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,720
makefiles etc

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,480
above and beyond the source code itself

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,159
again these can get into the specifics

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,919
of of the compliance

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,000
but it's good to understand these terms

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,400
and start making your plans

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,919
especially if you're in a somebody

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,480
making like iot software

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
automotive software or software for an

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
app store

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,600
anytime that you have a classic

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,039
distribution um it's important to record

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,240
this information so you talked

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
i talked a little bit before that we're

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,760
in this cloud era this kind of post

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,039
cloud era

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,440
and the idea there is there is

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,799
a lot of money being made out there by

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
companies there are companies who

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,000
started out as open source

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
and are finding themselves worth

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
billions of dollars

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
and there's also they're looking around

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
they also see other companies making a

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,880
lot of money

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,320
um perhaps off of their their own open

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,679
source projects

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,600
and so there's been a lot of heat

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,320
enlightened discussions and arguments

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,200
and fights

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,720
about what does it mean to be an open

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,559
source based company

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,919
in the 2020s and do you need to let

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,720
everybody

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,120
have the same access to your code under

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,440
the official open source definition

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,200
you can't restrict who can use your code

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,799
and how they use it

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
but you'll see more and more folks

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,960
saying well we're open source

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,600
but dot dot we're actually going to kind

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,039
of be what's called source available

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,799
so maybe not officially under open

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,919
source license anymore or some parts of

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,520
their projects

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,039
under open source but not the whole

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,960
thing and

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,120
the licensing that we're we're seeing

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,120
appear here is not open source it's

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
what i might call considered commercial

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,720
licensing but

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
let's say it's open source adjacent

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
things like the commons clause or the

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,520
server side public license

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,760
and what these are doing is putting

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,600
restrictions on certain business cases

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,200
and competitive business cases

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,440
particularly in terms of

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,039
hosting services and reselling services

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,360
around these libraries and these these

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
uh

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,600
these systems so if you're dealing with

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,720
things like databases

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,640
monitoring and search these are some

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,399
some company areas that we're starting

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
to see this change from classic

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
commercial licensing or classic open

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
source licensing

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,679
to these kind of business model

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,720
restrictions

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,799
so it's important to know this they're

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
not open source but they're they're

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,880
open source adjacent and they sometimes

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,600
get a little gray in terms of

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
um what's it mean what do these licenses

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,399
mean etc

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,799
but the general idea is pay attention to

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
um the the seismic shifts that are

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,720
occurring

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,679
in your in your especially your vendors

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,000
around

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,000
databases search and monitoring

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,120
so let's let's put our hat on and say

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,720
let's go look at a common license let's

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
let's understand a little bit about the

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,440
licensing this may be something that

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,440
comes across your desk

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
uh your engineers are gonna come to you

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
or you're gonna you're gonna be

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,440
downloading something and you're gonna

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,559
try to understand what the heck am i

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,799
looking at what does an open source

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,000
license look like what does it mean

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,080
so i've picked one of the shorter

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
licenses here very common license called

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
the bsd license

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,159
and what i like about this is it hits a

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,279
lot of the elements of licensing

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,960
in a pretty small package so this is a

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
pretty typical structure for a license

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,919
it may be

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
a page like this it might be 30 pages

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
but the general idea is there's going to

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,039
be

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,799
information about who wrote this what

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,320
are the terms of the obligations

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,320
and then maybe some legalese so

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,080
let's let's look through this line by

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,120
line

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,200
um i've uh i've put arrows next to the

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
various blocks here and given

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,080
uh kind of a description of what we're

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,840
looking at there are some colors but if

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,000
you're having problems with the colors

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,520
they should match up one by one by one

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
here the general idea is

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,200
most licenses are going to have a

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,399
copyright statement typically that is

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,720
the copyright

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,000
owner the person who wrote the code is

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,919
going to be mentioned there

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,520
though sometimes i'll find that that

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,039
gets a little confusing is it is it

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
about the copyright owner the license

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,919
itself or is it

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,960
of the code it is important to

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,200
understand who actually wrote the code

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,720
and so look for that copyright statement

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
very often those copyright statements

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
are what's expected to be seen

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,600
in your about box if you're not above

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,559
and beyond the licensing

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,559
you're going to want to see what the

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,520
permissions around redistribution and

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
use is

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,799
so can i can i use it in source form and

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,159
binary form

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,000
is there going to be something that says

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,520
if i use this in binary form that i need

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to provide the source code

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,360
to my users that's a copyleft term

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
that's very important to

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,520
watch out for you're going to see the

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,039
retain the copyright notice in the

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,799
source code form that's what's in yellow

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,559
here in section 1.

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,000
section two says yeah and retain the

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
copyright notice and put the license in

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,159
binary files as well

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,000
um number three is a non-endorsement

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,360
clause meaning don't don't use our name

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,159
you know don't don't say good things

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
about us or

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,640
don't say that you're good because you

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,399
use us and then lastly that disclaimer

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
very common to see in all caps there

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
that basically says uh

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
you know don't don't come after us and

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
sue us if this thing doesn't work for

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,919
you

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,440
so this is a classic license bsd you're

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,720
going to see all the other licenses of

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
very similar

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
forms to this they may have more

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,159
definitions they may

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,520
have more obligations but the general

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,520
format is going to be very similar

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,960
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,440
patents if you are dealing with

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,320
audio video streaming things across the

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,399
internet

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,159
if you're dealing with certain maybe

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,399
compression schemes and things like that

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,640
you may find that there are patents that

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,600
your company is either trying to enforce

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
and create or that you may find you may

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,840
need to license

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,919
so the code may be free to you but the

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,960
the technology the patented technology

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,679
behind the scenes

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,960
may require some licensing um some

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,640
financial licensing

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,519
to be paid and so um keep an eye out for

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,799
that especially any

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,519
anytime audio or video is being used i'm

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
always

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
very mindful that is there an additional

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,799
um

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
payment required for the for the use of

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
that technology

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,000
that's a patent license that may need to

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,760
be paid

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,840
other other licenses are going to talk

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,679
about um

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,840
passing along certain patents uh

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,760
permissions for free if you've producing

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,600
code or using code under this

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,519
license so if you're a company that has

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
a lot of patents

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,559
or working in spaces where there's a lot

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,880
in patents this is

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,480
very important place to watch out for

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,159
especially if your company is thinking

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,039
about doing any sort of patent lawsuits

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,440
in the future

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,559
you may find yourself with losing access

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,919
to some of the open source that you're

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,120
depending on

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,880
if you do that so important

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,760
important discussion with your lawyers

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,240
if you are involved with any of that

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,000
so let's talk about dual licensing this

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
is a very confusing topic for people

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,039
because the question is always

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,799
what does it mean why do i see multiple

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
license names

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,000
next to the name of the library does

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,760
that mean that they're both in effect

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,840
does that mean i have a choice

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
and the answer in open source is always

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,200
it depends

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,279
but usually if a library is calling

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,240
itself dual licensed or there's dual

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,240
licensing

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
available it usually means you have a

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
choice in the licensing

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,519
to you as a user of that library and

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,399
it's there's a couple different purposes

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,000
why you will see dual licensing um the

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
first one is what i call a business

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
model forcing function

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,000
well you'll have like a what you know a

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,440
scary license and a friendly license

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
um so they might have a scary license

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,279
you know

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,960
like a very strong copy left license

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,720
where you as a business might say oh we

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
can't use that we can't use copyleft in

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
our

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,480
our project but oh this is a great

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,760
library it's a great component

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
if only there was another license

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,360
available and then guess guess what

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,519
there's a commercial license that that

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,120
the company will gladly sell you

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,200
if you're unwilling or unable to use it

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,480
under that scary license or a scary to

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,600
you license

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,080
you see this very often in open core or

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,039
kind of open source companies where

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,000
they'll have a

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,600
a strong license for their their typical

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,360
library that you can download you'll see

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
this very often the database companies

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,600
oh you can download it for free and use

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,960
it

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,720
but if you start using it for commercial

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,640
purposes or doing distributions

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
you may find that the licensing terms

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,880
open source licensing terms are not

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,480
good for your your business model and

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,080
you'll find yourself

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,679
kind of buying your way out of that open

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,640
source license by buying the commercial

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,240
license that's

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
that's the most common reason we'll see

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,359
dual licensing these days in 2021.

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,599
in some of the older code you'll see it

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,520
was really a sign to say yes we

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,839
were we're compatible with all these

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,520
different open source models or

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,159
ecosystems so you'll see this like

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,159
jquery

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,040
what older versions of jquery would say

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,679
oh i'm i'm licensed under this or that

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,960
or these tri-license mpl or gpl or lgpl

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
you could use it under any of those

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,079
licenses and really it was about

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,800
showing that the community shouldn't

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,639
have any

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,159
worry about using it in the open source

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,599
projects themselves

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,800
don't see that very often anymore

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,800
usually it's the forcing function

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,520
okay in terms of

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,800
dual licensing examples um

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,639
the the general

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
places you'll see this i think most

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,200
times is going to be

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,200
databases so mysql mongodb you'll see

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,800
the options of an open source license or

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,440
a commercial license there

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
or some things like itex which is a pdf

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,560
library

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,400
agply license or commercial or wolf lssl

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,760
will be gpl or commercial

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,960
very common to see those and almost

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
certainly you're using one of these

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,079
libraries or these projects in your

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,920
company right now

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,520
the older versions of jquery where gpl

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
or mit they've now just changed their

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,040
license to mit if you if you happen to

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,320
see a version of jquery that's gpl or

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,599
mit in your code base

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,040
that's assigned perhaps you need to be

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,079
upgrading your version of jquery because

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,079
maybe it's a little too old

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,119
so let's talk about um licensed versions

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,160
so as time goes on

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,760
open source license versions change so

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,760
you may see like the general public

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,200
license went from version one

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,839
back in the 1980s to version two

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,240
to now version three apache software

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,760
license version one to 1.1 to 20.

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,400
some have version numbers like that

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,880
others have um

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
descriptions like bsd won't have a

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,880
version but they'll say zero clause one

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,000
clause two clause three clause

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,640
um and the idea there is to try to give

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,800
you

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,079
an understanding of which version of the

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
license are we talking about

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
the difference between apache 1 and

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
apache 2o

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,440
is pretty great when you look at the

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,599
license text itself

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,280
you know the the version 1 license is

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,400
very short the version 2 license is

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
fairly long

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,599
from from a use case perspective they're

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,480
pretty similar

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,079
but the version 2 license definitely

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,680
gives more legalese and more

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,280
descriptions and more definitions to

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,800
make it easier for business

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
businesses to understand what's allowed

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,960
and what's not allowed with it

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,640
the bsd license started out with like a

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,240
four four clauses

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
and as time has gone on people have

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,839
removed more and more obligations from

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,839
the bsd license for certain use

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,000
use cases and then there's things to

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,960
watch out for like mit license

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,800
has no version no clause difference but

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
if you go out there there might be 23

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
different

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,040
variants of the mit license out there

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
depending on which one you grab so if

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
you go to fedora project and look at

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
that

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,359
they have they found 23 different

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,720
versions of the mit license

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,400
in the code that they're using all

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,480
slightly different and

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,760
and when it comes to legal compliance

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,880
it's important to understand exactly

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,200
what you're signing up for

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
so so what does it mean what does it

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,680
mean

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,119
you know reviewing the licenses why do i

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,160
need to care

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,800
distribution for many organizations

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,440
is where a lot of the open source

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,040
licensed

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,040
discussions come into effect and the

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,000
idea behind open source

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,880
licensing for the most part was based on

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
the world where

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,920
products were being distributed where

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,359
there was a install

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,359
installer that went out whether it was

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,880
an app that went out whether it was a

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,200
device

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,480
um container whatever it is it's

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,520
something that went from

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,359
the company's uh location to your

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,760
business or personal location

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
got installed on your device your laptop

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,920
or whatever it may be

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,560
something that you purchased or

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,720
downloaded so if you are

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,079
in the one of those worlds building apps

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,960
containers devices

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,839
cars iot devices et cetera it's

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,880
extremely

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,040
important for you to understand

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,079
distribution linking etc

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,560
if you're building websites uh or or sas

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,880
apps

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
software service apps you may have less

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
concerns about some of these licenses

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,000
because of the distribution you're not

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,000
distributing a product based on those

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,680
so is it important to ask and you may

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,040
find that you have multiple use cases

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
for the same product you may have

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,920
software as a service running out there

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,960
on some cloud service

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,320
but you also are providing a an app on a

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
mobile phone

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
there may be cases where libraries are

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,599
being distributed on the phone that you

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,440
didn't realize

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,040
very often people say oh we're we're

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
private cloud we don't we never

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,880
distribute anything and then the largest

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,800
customer in the world says oh except for

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,119
us we want you to bring it over to us

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,720
and install it on our our systems

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,720
so you might have gone from not having a

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,079
distribution to distributing your entire

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,640
software stack

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,760
and so if you are moving from a a

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,000
non-distribution

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
to a distribution world it's very common

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,960
for you to have a lot of open source

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
compliance problems because if you built

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
under one regime

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,480
and now you're running under a different

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,320
regime licensing regime

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,400
you may find that the compliance use

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,320
case was completely night and day

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
so understand what you're building

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,920
understand what your future business

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,839
model changes may be

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,440
especially if you're going from software

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,280
as a service to maybe a distribution

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
model in the future

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,000
you may find yourself needing to do some

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,000
fixes or remediation

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,880
okay so a couple things what looks like

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,440
open source but isn't

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,960
uh so we often talk about open source

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,640
but in general when you are finding

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,280
yourself in the kind of the management

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
world of

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,880
managing your third-party software

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,280
you're going to see commercial code

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,480
you're going to see true open source and

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,599
you're going to find stuff that people

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
just downloaded and

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,599
they thought it's open source they may

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,040
call it open source but it's not

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
and there's a spectrum of things there

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
there may be code marked for

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,920
non-commercial use

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,800
also known as nc in general if i see

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,200
that in my

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
place where i'm working i try to fix

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,040
that because uh

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,000
uh most most of what most of the things

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,440
that we're doing we probably are going

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,960
to consider commercial use you know if

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
you're doing something as a hobby or at

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,400
home maybe that's non-commercial but if

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,040
i see that at a workplace

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,160
that's something i need to fix i might

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,480
see freeware

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
or things with click-through eulas or

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,079
these weird one-off licenses we're not

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,880
sure if it's commercial or open source

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,160
or whatnot

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,079
these may be cases where we want to

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,760
record the license and talk to our legal

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,359
staff or our engineering staff about are

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,079
we okay with this what are we signing up

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,240
for nobody

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,319
might have reviewed those licenses you

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,920
might simply just say all rights reserve

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,599
well that doesn't give any obligations

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,800
or doesn't give you any permissions or

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,960
it doesn't give you an insight into the

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,160
obligations you're signing up for

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,440
and same thing with code with no

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,880
declared license you might go out to

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,119
github and you can download it

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
but if you don't have a license file you

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,079
really don't have any permission to use

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,520
that so these are all things to be aware

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,280
of and when you build your bill of

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,960
materials kind of your list of open

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,040
source that you're you're

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,880
you're using it's important for you to

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,520
um understand this

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,000
the licensing is it open source is it is

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,920
it

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,520
the stuff in the middle of her

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,960
commercial and keep track of this

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,319
sometimes people just say oh just keep

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
track of your open source

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,920
my philosophy is to keep track of

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,079
anything third party that your company

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,040
didn't write

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,560
so um we have i think a couple minutes

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,400
here before our break

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,079
um so how about i stop and see if

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,359
there's any questions here

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,160
and if there are we'll take those now

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,560
and then i believe we're going to have a

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,599
a

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,880
15 minute break and come back at 3 45

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,280
to go over security

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,400
best practices and other elements of

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,280
compliance

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,280
so any questions

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,400
let me go to q a here i have a question

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,680
here as it said

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,960
if it's too hard to decide on a license

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,240
is it best or not to have a declared

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
license

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,880
um so let me let me answer let me try to

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,560
take a stab on that i'm not i'm not 100

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,560
sure um uh this

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,079
you know kind of the declared license or

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,400
not but in general

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,119
um if you are making something that you

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,040
want to be

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,800
open source you want to put it out there

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,240
on the internet and you want other

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,440
people to use it

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,160
it's it's imperative for you to declare

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,000
a license

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,599
um so if you go to github and you make a

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,520
new um

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,200
repository for example it's gonna it's

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,000
gonna pass you over to a site called i

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,599
think choose a license.worker.com

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,040
and it's gonna walk you through some

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,720
some possibilities it's not an

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,920
exhaustive list there's many many

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,560
licenses that are out there you can

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,480
choose

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,839
they're going to kind of put you into a

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,040
small subset

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,960
but i think it's important for you to

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,280
understand what is your what is your

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,960
uh you know what's called your clientele

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,640
what how do you want people to use your

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,040
licenses you might pick something like

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,160
an

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,000
apache 2o license if um

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,680
you don't expect people to share the

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
source code but you want people to

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,480
understand what

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,800
what the um that it is open source and

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,040
that there are certain um

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,319
maybe notice requirements or obligations

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,760
for them but you don't care about

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,920
sharing the source

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,119
you may might pick to say gpl if you

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,520
expect people to

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,640
um share all the source code or if

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,760
you've picked

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,599
a base that is um requires you to be

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,040
say something under the gpl license et

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,119
cetera so um

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,480
i think long story short if you're

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,000
putting out something out there for some

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,760
other people to use you do have to pick

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,680
a license in my opinion

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,680
and you can always change that license

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
in the future but it's important to get

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
the license

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,359
right for your community for the

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,560
community you want to build it's also

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,599
important for your license to be

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,839
compatible

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,280
with the the other libraries that you

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,640
brought in so if you bring in something

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,280
that's gpl

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,839
you probably will find yourself in a

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,599
world

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,680
that your your code itself probably

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,880
should be gpl and pass that through and

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,240
so on and so on so

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,359
um thanks for that question there and

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,720
we'll talk a little bit more about that

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,839
in the second half as well in terms of

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,000
compliance

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,920
and uh and obligations there so thanks

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,040
so much

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,200
so it's it's half past right now um we

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,560
will take a 15-minute break

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,040
and then we'll come back here and we'll

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,640
continue on with the rest of the session

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,680
here and we'll have time for q a at the

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
end as well

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,839
so thank you very much well everybody

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,119
thanks so much for for rejoining us

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,119
i'm going to continue with the second

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,640
half of the just enough open source a

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,319
kickstarter on security license

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,079
compliance and business models if

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,000
if you're just joining us right now i

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
think you'll be able to get a lot out of

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,200
the second half of this even without the

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,240
first half i'm going to be talking about

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,640
security and compliance

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,160
as before please feel free to ask some

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,480
questions put them in the chat or in the

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,240
q

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,079
a and we'll spend a couple minutes at

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,040
the end of the talk uh going through

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,119
that as well

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,400
if you have any um other comments you

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,319
know please send me uh

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,520
something either through twitter at

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,040
jefflush

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,200
or um through my blog at

00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,880
zebracatzebra.com

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,839
a little easier to spell than uh than

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,839
lush

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,839
okay a little bit about me i've been

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,240
doing open source since uh the 90s

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,040
and a lot of experience working with

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
compliance

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,480
and companies getting them up to speed

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,920
around open source

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,400
and i'm now the director of open source

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,720
at peak six so if you have any questions

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,599
um about any of the this history also

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,920
feel free to

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,520
ask in the qa q a or through email

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,920
afterward

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,400
so what we're going to finish up today

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,000
is the rest of security and best

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,960
practices

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,520
and as well as some of the business

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,920
model discussions in hot topics

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,359
so you might have remembered from just

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,880
about 15 minutes ago we're talking about

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,800
things that looked like open source that

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
we're not

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,359
i always like talking about public

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,240
domain as well

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,280
what very often you will hear the term

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,240
public domain

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,839
misused it is a series of magic words

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,520
and again i'm not a lawyer so don't take

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,520
this as legal advice

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
but i hear these words come up and all

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,480
the time around open source and open

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,520
source licensing and description and on

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,240
the internet

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,319
and it has a very specific legal meaning

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,839
that meaning itself may be different

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,400
depending on which country or part of

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,800
the world

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,760
you're in but whenever i hear people say

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,720
public domain

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,760
my ears kind of uh perk up and i i want

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,079
to make sure that

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,359
uh you know whatever i'm reading or what

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,440
i'm listening to

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,880
is accurate when it talks about the

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,440
public domain

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,520
so these words are very often misused so

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,760
sometimes developers will say oh yeah

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,640
it's public domain source code and what

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,000
they really mean is

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,000
gpl or this code is public

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,280
domain when they really mean that it's

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,400
open source

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,319
so it's usually not enough just to hear

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,440
that somebody said oh it's public domain

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,359
i'm pretty sure

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,040
you you want to you want to be sure you

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,240
know it's it's important to look at the

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,599
original code

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,520
make sure they know what they're talking

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,119
about i i've seen people

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,520
the developers themselves in the open

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,280
source world say this code is licensed

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,480
to the public domain under the gpl

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,839
license like those are words i've

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,680
explicitly seen

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,280
and that's like a nonsense statement

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,800
like they the two halves of that

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,760
statement are not compatible with each

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,119
other

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,280
so understand what what

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,319
what public domain world you're actually

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,319
living in

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,160
and um you may want to look or look at

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,240
project licenses like the creative

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,920
commons xero license also known as the

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,240
cc0 license

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,000
which is um a open source license that

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,119
was designed to give

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,960
a kind of the equivalent or tries to be

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,720
the equivalent of the public domain

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,119
with really kind of a worldwide reach

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,000
there's many countries that don't

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,079
have the concept of a public domain or

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,839
it's hard to give away your rights

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,599
so you may want to look at something

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,680
like create a common zero

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,440
is something that makes it really clear

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,480
what the obligations and expectations

00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,040
are from a kind of a worldwide reach

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,000
so when don't we know enough when you're

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,359
looking at your list of

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,280
open source libraries that's something

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,640
we call bill of materials where you're

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,319
looking at a web page and you're trying

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,800
to understand what the heck is this

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,960
there's sometimes statements from the

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,599
developers or statements from your

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,760
colleagues that that that are

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,520
informative but not complete

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,480
so somebody might say oh it's licensed

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,440
under a creative commons license

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,200
it's important to understand that

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
creative commons is an organization that

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,880
has

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,160
a whole spectrum of licenses

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,400
from everything like we just talked

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,599
about the cc0 being almost like the

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,359
public domain

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,040
all the way over to something like the

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,920
creative commons share alike

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,319
which is a very strong copyleft license

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
so

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,760
that there's a whole spectrum there from

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,240
pretty much no obligations to

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,160
sharing your source code obligations so

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
you need to know more if something is cc

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,480
licensed

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
you need to know kind of the extra

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,119
letters the extra words

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,559
um that fully define that license or

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,079
somebody says oh i got it on it code's

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,119
on github well that's not sufficient

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,480
yeah it's out there

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,160
you can download it the source is

00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,800
available but you might have absolutely

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,880
no

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,400
permissions to use that in a kind of a

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,440
business environment or an open source

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,880
environment

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,640
or sometimes like oh i got the code from

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,440
our supplier it's part of a

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,200
sdk a software development kit just

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,880
because you got it from your supplier

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,240
doesn't mean that it's commercial i see

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,040
a lot of companies get themselves in

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,720
trouble because they

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,800
they trust that everything that came on

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,319
the dvd or everything that came from the

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,680
download is commercial and they can do

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,280
whatever they want with it

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,119
and when you open it up it's full of

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,359
linux code or code under

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,800
general public license or other open

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,400
source licenses so

00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,160
just because your supplier gave it to

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,440
you doesn't mean that it's a

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,880
commercially licensed code you might

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,880
have paid a lot of money for it

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,319
but there may be other obligations and

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,760
other licenses there

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,760
or somebody says oh we bought a license

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,319
for this um great

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,280
classic commercial licensing was it was

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,680
it per year

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,640
was it just for a certain use case was

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,359
it just for a certain

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,200
um person so it's important to

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,240
understand all the licensing from open

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,520
source to

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,720
commercial licensing the other thing

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,559
that has changed is

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,000
the sheer amount of open source and

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,559
third-party code that are

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,800
that's in a typical product these days

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,440
if you go back in time to like the year

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,079
2000 at the bottom of this pyramid here

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,040
you might have had 50 libraries 50 open

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,880
source projects

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,880
in your classic lamp stack if you

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,000
remember the lamp you know linux

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,880
apache my sequel and php

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,079
50 libraries was a huge open source uh

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,400
dependency

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,680
tree back in the year 2000. oh my gosh i

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,280
can't believe how long it figured

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,800
it took us to figure that out and

00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,920
understand the licensing and all that

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,599
that was year 2000. um 2010

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,520
a pretty typical application would have

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,280
about 500 components

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,119
that's a lot to manage that's a lot to

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,880
discover um kind of in the

00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,800
cloud world beginning of the cloud world

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,800
and now when you see

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,960
like these um node apps with old

00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,720
microservices

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,880
and you know they call it the mean stack

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,559
you might have 5 000 libraries they

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,800
might be very tiny libraries little

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
pieces here and there but you got 5 000

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,680
of things

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,319
you know 5 000 of anything is an

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,680
extremely difficult thing to manage if

00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,079
it was 5000

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,680
nuts and bolts and screws that's a

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,640
non-trivial thing to keep them all

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,119
in you know track of is let alone 5 000

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,200
software components

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,640
so how do you get all this code how did

00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,839
we go from 50

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,280
libraries to now like 500 or 5 000 well

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,359
one of the things is your developers are

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,880
probably using a repository manager

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,599
that's basically a special software

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,520
package

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,079
that goes out and downloads from the

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,400
internet open source dependencies

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,119
so you might hear terms like maven or

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,520
nexus

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:47,440
or artifactory or npm or pip or pi pi

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,680
these are all um services for managing

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,119
open source dependencies and sometimes

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,119
commercial dependencies

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,559
and they they download things from the

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,559
internet they cache them

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,720
they sometimes have some light policy

00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,160
management there

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,960
that's often the thing that's going to

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,160
bring in dozens to hundreds of libraries

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,559
you might specify

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,640
oh i need this library and the package

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,119
manager the repository manager will also

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,599
bring in

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,760
all of its dependencies sometimes

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,920
surprising dependencies

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,040
your developers might go to the download

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,040
it directly from the web

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,200
they might use a magic shell script they

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,040
might cut and paste source code

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,559
or get things from things called paste

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,319
bins or gists

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,160
where you can cut little pieces of code

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,720
there sometimes without licensing

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,400
clear maybe your content delivery

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,240
network is passing along especially for

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,520
javascript libraries

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,280
you might be getting it from your

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,040
commercial

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,480
projects or bundled with other open

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,079
source packages

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,480
it may be your infrastructure like your

00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,640
databases your operating systems

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,160
and vendors and suppliers these are all

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,280
the ways that open source and other

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,200
third-party software

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,119
gets into your company or gets into your

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,400
product and very often people just look

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,160
at one of these like they just might

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,960
stop at the first line of oh we'll

00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,000
manage it

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,000
manage everything coming from the

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,359
repository managers and

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,640
ignore everything else and i think

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,160
that's a mistake you do have to start

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,040
some place and you you can't

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,920
boil the ocean and solve everything but

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,240
your policy around your company and your

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,760
kind of complete vision of where your

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,000
third-party dependencies come from

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,920
whether it's commercial open source

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,119
kind of is from this entire list of

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,640
items so

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,040
just because you manage your

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,400
repositories doesn't mean you've solved

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,440
your problem and you should keep

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,280
you know keep working on it and the idea

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,839
here is what we call the software supply

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,359
chain

00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,800
and i think this is the year of the

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,160
software supply chain you know you're

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,319
going to read a lot about and hear a lot

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,040
about like the solar winds attack

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,680
and how the software supply chain is is

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,160
is

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,680
you know weak and damaged um over the

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,960
weekend you know php

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,240
the the saw this kind of the software

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,160
library and runtime got hacked through a

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,599
supply chain attack somebody somebody

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,200
injected a back door

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,040
directly into the source code and got

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,839
caught thankfully but

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,720
um this is the year i think of every

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,720
year of

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,640
people talking about the supply chain

00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,480
what are you using how did you get it

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,720
how is it managed

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,839
typically you have hundreds of suppliers

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,400
and if you're building something like an

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,319
iot

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400
or an automotive product you probably

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,440
have thousands of suppliers

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,960
and it's going to be a mixture of open

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,680
source commercial and things you know

00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,760
with free with air quotes around them

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,200
and it's not just libraries it's

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,160
software libraries also known as

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,880
components

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,280
tool chains like compilers and linkers

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,280
documentation code generators

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,960
and you may not have any access at all

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,800
with your with your suppliers

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,400
you might be just be given a big chunk

00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,079
of code and you don't even know where it

00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,359
came from you may not even know where

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,319
how you got it especially in the

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,319
hardware world this is very common

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,920
so it's good to start understanding what

00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,960
your supply chain looks like

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,799
how code comes in uh record who gave it

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,839
to you what your permissions are

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,880
and just understand you know how far

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,839
back does it go

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,359
because you are the person responsible

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,040
for the security and licensing

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,599
of whatever you use even if even if you

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,040
got it from somebody else

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,960
and so one of the ways you manage that

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,359
is through licensed policies

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,880
and so license policies help your

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,240
developers help your team help your

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,119
company understand

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,880
what is the appropriate style of open

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,480
source to use

00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,480
what isn't what is important around

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,920
commercial code licensing etc so you

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,760
define your policy

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,160
it's typically based on a distribution

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,040
model so these licenses are good for

00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,480
internal use

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,040
these licenses are good for our iphone

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,520
apps or

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,559
our android apps or our code that we're

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,599
pushing out to

00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,960
customer desktops or this this is

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,640
allowed in the um in the car

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
but only in this level the operating

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,160
system level but not the

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,240
end user app level and so on and so on

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,000
so your distribution model

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,599
and layers in your distribution model

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,040
are going to have different policies

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,799
and it's really important to have a

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,640
clear policy so your developers should

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,319
be able to go to a centralized location

00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,359
or have a centralized document for like

00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,079
a live

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,520
always updated version of this and it

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,119
needs to be updated periodically you're

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,720
going to find new licenses

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,640
almost every week and you're going to

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,640
say we like it we don't like it or you

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,920
come to us for more information because

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,079
um the specifics of how that code is

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,760
used and how it's distributed

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,200
is probably going to change based on

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,400
where you are in your company and how

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,079
you distribute your code

00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,839
and it's very expensive to rip out

00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,520
unacceptable code at a later point so if

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,520
you built a whole product you put it in

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
an iot device or you put it on the phone

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,880
or you put it in a car

00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,000
and it turns out that the base of your

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,880
your whole stack

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,640
is um something that you can't use um

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,760
it's going to be very expensive to rip

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,880
out we saw this recently with ruby on

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,720
rails

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,240
last week or the week before it turns

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,960
out that they had a

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,280
sub-component that had a what appeared

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,599
to be a license

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,200
difficulty or license problem where had

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,200
code that may not have been appropriate

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,240
to have insider rails and they needed to

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,520
basically

00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,079
delete that code work around the license

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,160
problem

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,520
build a new sub-component and release a

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,760
new version and then it took a couple

00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,440
days and it took a lot of attention by

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
um pretty much everybody who's involved

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,680
with the rails project there

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,280
so understand what's there how it got

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,319
there have a good plan you are going to

00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,119
find things

00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,319
that may not be appropriate or problems

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,160
later on

00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:22,079
the rails project was well served by

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,240
their automation they found that the

00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,599
component had a disappeared and then

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,079
they found that the license was not

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,319
appropriate

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,760
for them and their automated systems

00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,200
really made it easy for them to

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,400
understand where the problem was and

00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,200
what the type of problem was so they

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,799
could get the right people to fix it

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,280
so let's talk about what compliance

00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,799
looks like if you are building a product

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,119
for distribution

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,799
uh you're gonna almost certainly need to

00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,280
have compliance notices

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,319
so you need to show what open source

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,160
you're using

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,599
and pass along the appropriate things

00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,799
that the open source projects want you

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,720
to pass along

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,240
a good example of this is if you're

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,000
using something like google chrome and

00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,480
you go to the about box

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,920
it's very common for for apps that you

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,119
download to have something like this you

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,559
know google chrome is made

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,480
possible by the chromium open source

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,319
project and other open source software a

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,040
nice blue link you click it

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,920
and if you um click on that you are

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,760
brought to a

00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:18,319
list of from you know absel to zlib

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,400
a to z of all the open source libraries

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,240
that chromium depends on

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,599
and what you see is a nice list of the

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,079
library name

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,359
a license and a link to the home page

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,440
and this may be

00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,440
above and beyond what the licenses

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,480
require especially for each items that

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,000
that's in this list

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,079
but it's very nice and i think it's very

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
respectful of the open source world it's

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,200
showing the dependency on open source

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
it's showing

00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,920
the name the actual license text itself

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,520
and kind of giving some publicity to the

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,880
project by making it super easy to go to

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,480
the homepage and i think this is like i

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,359
said very respectful of the open source

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,040
world

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,799
and i i always like pointing this as

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,079
something to if you can

00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,880
um i think it's something good to

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,599
emulate um in terms of um

00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,240
giving credit where credit's due um and

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,799
if you click

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,359
on the show license like i clicked here

00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,920
for the zlib it brings me to the actual

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,839
license

00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,599
text for the library that chromium

00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,200
depended on a library called z-lib which

00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,200
is a compression library

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,240
and we see the license text here we see

00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,960
the version number

00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,000
we see the copyright string and you know

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,640
some of the information that's

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,200
there um very nice to see and it's it's

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,880
it's

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,319
the license management side can

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,599
sometimes be kind of painful

00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,920
like understanding where the license

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,880
text came from recording it and having

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,000
the accurate

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,040
um up-to-date version um very often

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,720
requires a tool

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,880
to help manage so the other

00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,000
reason why you want to have a list of

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,319
your open source

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,240
number one we just showed it's you

00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,000
require for compliance needs very often

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,799
you need to show the license text

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,559
for the products that you're

00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,160
distributing but even if you're not

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,040
distributing something like say you're a

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,480
classic software

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,480
service project and you say oh i don't

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,680
have to worry about license notices

00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,720
you want to know what you're using

00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,480
because of vulnerabilities basically all

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,599
source code with all sort all apps

01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,720
whether it's commercial

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,680
open source whatever has bugs open

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,920
source probably

01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,280
is is safer or cleaner than many

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,040
commercial projects because of the many

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,040
eyes effect etc

01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,799
lots of people looking at it but the

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,880
general idea is you know

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,119
people find attacks people find ways to

01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,920
break into systems or get information

01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,599
out of it

01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,640
and so one thing one term that you're

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:29,280
going to want to be aware of is a cve

01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,680
that's kind of an industry name standard

01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,520
name

01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:35,720
for a defect list so you can go to this

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,359
database of defects out there at

01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,319
cve.mitre.org

01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:42,640
and this is a clearinghouse of open

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,480
source and commercial vulnerabilities

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,920
each defect is given a number like a

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,680
serial number or a name

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,680
so like cve-2021-001

01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,599
would be the first defect reported in

01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,960
the year 2021

01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,640
and many many defects get this level of

01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,799
analysis you know get this so

01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,559
um especially infrastructure pieces and

01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,440
very very popular libraries and

01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,079
applications

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,680
but not all of them do um just you know

01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,119
just because there's no

01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,240
defect listed for something in in the

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:16,000
vulnerability database the nvd

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,920
there still may be vulnerability so you

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,119
might see it in the projects defect

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,280
tracker on github

01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
or bitbucket or it may be only in an

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,359
email list and things like that but i

01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,359
would say

01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,040
at a very minimum you should be aware of

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,440
the the vulnerabilities that are popping

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,839
up

01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,359
on the um the cves that are popping up

01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,359
in the national vulnerability database

01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,319
you're almost certainly aware of some

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,079
even if you didn't think you did

01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,720
there's two vulnerabilities that really

01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,480
got uh kind of worldwide visibility

01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,920
so back in um you know back in 2000 uh

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,480
2014 there was the heartbleed

01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,000
vulnerability around openssl which is an

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,839
encryption library

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,680
basically affected every piece of modern

01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,920
infrastructure network infrastructure

01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,079
iot device in the world

01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,880
what's crazy is i still find broken

01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,480
versions of openssl from this era

01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,680
to this date and it's just because

01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,079
people don't know what they're using and

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,680
they don't

01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,160
have control over their offer supply

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,960
chain um back in 2017

01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,400
the struts 2 library had a vulnerability

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,960
that was found and fixed

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,799
but um that was one of the the causes of

01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,000
the equifax breach if you remember that

01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,559
back in 2017

01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,359
or so and again this is the importance

01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,200
of having

01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,960
understanding what you're using what's

01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,839
coming in from your vendors

01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,359
and have a plan for fixing it you need

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,640
to know that it's there you need to know

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,640
that there's a vulnerability and you

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,720
need to have a way of getting your fix

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,960
whether it's a code change or a firewall

01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,559
rule or whatever your mitigation is

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,400
done very quickly because very often you

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,720
don't have a lot of time to fix these

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,720
things

01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,160
one of the reasons why is because these

01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,119
attacks are scripted

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,839
you can download an attack kit and not

01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,200
even know

01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:56,000
what you're doing basically just hit a

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,359
button and go scan and find

01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,200
projects and vulnerable commercial

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,160
projects that are out there websites etc

01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,039
that are

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,559
able to be hacked so it's very easy for

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,680
attackers or hackers to

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,680
to under to find places where

01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,200
these you know you could be attack

01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,640
somebody once said in our industry

01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,240
you know open source components or all

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,160
components age like milk

01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,920
not like wine so just because

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,240
something's old

01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,760
typically the older a component is the

01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,480
more likely i want to look for an

01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,319
upgrade

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,680
because vulnerabilities may have been

01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,280
whether public or not public may have

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,039
been found over time

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,880
and typically the the simple fix is to

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,280
upgrade them to the latest safe

01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,720
the release that may be great from a

01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,559
vulnerability perspective

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,200
but it may introduce other issues for

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,079
you so um it's great to game play you

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,400
know play these out

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,160
kind of war game these out what happens

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,280
if we upgrade this or let's try let's

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,280
upgrade something

01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,799
and see what the impacts are there may

01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,160
be a license change that may be

01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:55,280
incompatible for you

01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:58,000
um there may be a api incompatibility or

01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,079
memory bloat or unwanted features etc so

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,920
it's important to understand

01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,799
these fixes may fix your vulnerability

01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,200
problem but they might cause

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,319
architectural licensing problems for you

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,880
there may be some other things that you

01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,559
can do beyond upgrading it maybe

01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,640
turning off features or putting in

01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,160
firewall rules or shims or things like

01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,599
that that can buy you some time

01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,440
but the important thing is to have a

01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,640
plan and this is

01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,400
if you're not already talking to your

01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,319
cso and your security team and your

01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,480
engineering team and your legal team

01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:26,000
it's important to understand that you're

01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,160
probably sitting on vulnerabilities

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,240
right now that need to be addressed and

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,559
fixed and it's best to start

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,319
um it doesn't have to be perfect to

01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,760
start start working on it and start

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,760
chipping away at the attack surface

01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,280
where this comes up very often is

01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,680
customers are starting to ask

01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,680
customers are running their own scanners

01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,559
whether it's like a dynamic scanner

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,920
called dast

01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,680
style scanners or sca which is software

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,720
composition analysis which are open

01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,880
source

01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,280
component scanners we're seeing more and

01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,200
more kind of customers saying hey i ran

01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,359
your product through our das

01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,119
scanner or sca scanner and here's a

01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,400
laundry list of problems that you gave

01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,000
us

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,160
they might have human teams especially

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,240
if you're selling too large very large

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,000
you know fortune 500 fortune 50

01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,359
companies they might say well

01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,640
it's great we'll install this but only

01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,960
after we do put it pass it through our

01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,480
security team or human team review

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,640
and they expect you to fix the most

01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,920
egregious issues at least

01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,520
they're going to want open source

01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,720
disclosures as part of your contract

01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,280
very often we're seeing this more and

01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,039
more

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,280
um give us a list of all the open source

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,920
you're using and uh hey this isn't up

01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,680
this is

01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,119
this report's five years old what do you

01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,640
think what are you doing here it has to

01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,720
be updated et cetera et cetera

01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,880
and red flags will make them walk away

01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,240
i've seen security issues and lack of

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,920
software visibility

01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,680
make big companies walk away they have

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,880
probably multiple choices of vendors

01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,799
that they could be using

01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,720
and the ones who have poor security are

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,400
often ones that are that are passed over

01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,280
when it comes to

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,280
getting the contract

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,480
okay so that brings us to remediation

01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,680
which is a fancy word meaning

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,440
fix and so you'll often ask what's our

01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,119
remediation strategy

01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,960
how do we fix these things and and i

01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,599
think it's it's it's

01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,319
there's two sides of the coin here one

01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,079
is

01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,680
it is much easier to build in open

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,880
source management in new products that

01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,400
you're building so if you're starting a

01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,160
new project today

01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,760
you should be having code scanning

01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,440
installed from the very beginning

01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,520
you should have license policy clear you

01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,559
should be having a great cve

01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,359
upgrade policy um start do it right the

01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,280
first time

01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,960
but fixing an existing product sometimes

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,119
difficult sometimes expensive

01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,559
but so is doing nothing just waiting

01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,319
around and waiting for an attack or

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,000
waiting for a customer problem

01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,359
um makes it so that you're working on

01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,280
somebody else's time

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,200
time you know calendar then rather than

01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,720
yours so

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,079
you'll find that legal concern sometimes

01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,440
get in the way of technical analysis

01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,559
like oh don't go look there because we

01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,760
don't want to know we don't want to know

01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,000
what's going on there

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,799
um i personally think that that

01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,280
sometimes

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,119
blocks important security work i i think

01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,799
you need to get past the oh don't look

01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,319
there when we might find something well

01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,599
you will find something and you'll be on

01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:04,960
somebody else's time

01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,720
time schedule to fix it the oddball

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,599
licenses definitely lead to large legal

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,839
bills

01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,520
the weirder they are the sometimes the

01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,880
harder it is for people to understand

01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,720
or figure out gpl violations can be very

01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,400
very expensive to fix

01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,880
so again try to get those fixed sooner

01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,559
and later but also commercial violations

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,200
we always talk about open source but

01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,640
some of the biggest bills that i've seen

01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,720
have been commercial violations where

01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,720
somebody has shipped you know

01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,160
thousands or millions of copies of a

01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,799
commercial library and then the

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,920
accounting comes due

01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,119
and the bill is big so um

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,039
sooner you can fix these things the

01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,240
cheaper it will be and it is always

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,680
better to fix these things before they

01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,359
go out the door the first time

01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,119
and nobody ever has to respect your own

01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,559
timetable you know your your customer

01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,839
can say you need to fix this

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,440
in a week or we're going to another

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,000
vendor um you don't have a lot of

01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,559
control

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,760
over that discussion it's good to it's

01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,559
good to

01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,240
respond and it is good to take it very

01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,359
seriously the companies that ignore put

01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,960
their head in the sand around

01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:05,760
vulnerability disclosure

01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,280
or license disclosure very often get

01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,760
routed around and not

01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,280
not picked in the future so let's talk

01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,880
about some best practices how do we how

01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,920
do we work with our suppliers

01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,960
well first off you want to select

01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,799
vendors who can provide you what's

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,560
called that current bill of materials

01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,080
so if you have a choice of two vendors

01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,040
and you say tell us what open source

01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,960
you're using

01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,400
and one vendor you know that same day

01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,440
sends you a bill of materials and the

01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,799
other one says what do you mean bill of

01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,560
materials

01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,080
that's a good sign you know having a

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,120
current bill materials is a really good

01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,799
sign of good

01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,600
engineering practices good security

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:37,679
practices and good compliance practices

01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,799
there's a project called open chain

01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,359
which is a

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:43,279
iso standard for managing supply chain

01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,279
and open source dependencies

01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,159
if somebody is open chain certified or

01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,520
conformant that's a really good sign

01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,040
there's still a lot of work to be done

01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,560
there and there's a lot of companies who

01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,759
need to to kind of bring that up

01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,159
up and running but it's a really good

01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,600
sign if you see that you may see service

01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:58,880
level agreements for security fixes and

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,199
alerts that's a really good

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,560
sign to see and if you're buying

01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,640
software you may want to put that in

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,920
place yourself

01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,839
i'm seeing more and more of these things

01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,239
becoming contract terms you know you

01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:13,440
will supply the list of bullet materials

01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,040
um you will fix uh you know red issues

01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,080
or orange issues within a certain amount

01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,679
of time

01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,759
and you do your validation test you'll

01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,440
run um you know if you're getting code

01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,799
from third parties run it through an sca

01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,600
tool or run it through a dynamic

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,799
scanning tool

01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,040
see what comes up and if you see

01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,359
problems before you sign a contract the

01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,440
best

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,679
you have the most power right then to

01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,960
say hey i want to use your stuff but i

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,400
see these problems

01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,759
that's sometimes a great way for them to

01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,759
get some pressure to kick off their

01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,520
engineering fixes themselves so hey my

01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,120
my customers are asking for it it makes

01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,799
a little more palatable internal to

01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,799
eternally to get these things running

01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,640
but the buck does stop with you if you

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,040
are a product for your product company

01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,040
and you

01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,480
are your supply chain gives you a

01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,239
problem you can

01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,600
point the finger and say oh it's not our

01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:55,199
fault it's you know we inherited bad

01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,880
code from xyz

01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,239
but i think in general your customers

01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,239
look at you to say well

01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,679
i don't care why the problem occurred

01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:04,320
i'm just upset that

01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:05,840
um the problem occurred on your watch so

01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,199
do remember the buck stops with you

01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,040
it isn't it is important for you to

01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,719
respect you know your your customer data

01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,560
and your customer needs

01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,840
so how do you become compliant you know

01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,760
you've gone to this session

01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,440
you've listened to this you know how

01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,360
what more do we have to do well i think

01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,199
i think first off is build your team of

01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,719
internal open source experts internally

01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,520
that could be one person two people

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,960
eight people ten people um i see more

01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,560
and more uh people are making what's

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,960
called open source working groups

01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,600
that's kind of a quasi-official dotted

01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,880
line

01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,040
you know it's not it may not be

01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,000
somebody's um direct reports but it's

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,080
people who

01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,800
enjoy open source understand licensing

01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,760
understand security or at least have a

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,440
a concern in that space make sure your

01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,360
projects all create a bill of materials

01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,120
also known as a bomb or a software bill

01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,719
of materials s-bomb

01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,920
we're seeing more and more requirements

01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,040
and i think we're going to see from at

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,640
least in the u.s

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,560
more federal requirements about mill

01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,719
materials for

01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,880
companies working with the government

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,880
there is spdx reports that's a format

01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,040
for sharing open source notices and

01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,159
disclosures

01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,840
be able to make that you want to look

01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,880
for a tool that can generate that or an

01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,440
equivalent

01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,280
obviously do the education i think you

01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,920
can't you can't educate your staff

01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,280
enough

01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,760
there's some great courses like the

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,159
linux foundation has a ip and licensing

01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,640
course it's like an hour it's free

01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:24,719
great beginning start for that i think

01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,000
nobody is too senior to get this i think

01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,679
sometimes the senior people probably

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,440
need it more than the junior people

01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,120
i mean if you can yourself become open

01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,640
chain conformant they make it very easy

01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,920
go to the open chain project to see the

01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,159
checklists and the things that you need

01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,159
to do

01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,920
um in terms of licensing and education

01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,080
software developers often lack training

01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,480
we don't teach this in university

01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,360
uh people people self-select to come to

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,400
talks like this

01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,760
but it's usually not mandated and it's

01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,920
important to to make sure that your

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,360
developers get this i i personally think

01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,640
it should be mandated training

01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,159
i think the most important thing that we

01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,840
can do around software development these

01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,400
days is have open source understanding

01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,520
by the

01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,520
by our developers

01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,440
open source policies need to be created

01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,960
impossible to find

01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,719
if you're your company right now and

01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,600
said what let me find our open source

01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,360
policy

01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,719
if it's not on a website if it's not on

01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,280
an internal um

01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,400
share you should push for that it should

01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,640
be crystal clear

01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,159
what your license policies what you can

01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,480
use and can't use and who where do you

01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,920
go for help should be crystal clear

01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,840
legal could be scared to look for

01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,280
problems i think it's sometimes

01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,199
important to rip that band-aid off and

01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,640
say let's start let's start looking

01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,320
let's start chipping away

01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,000
because we want to make we want to build

01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,280
all new products in a compliant way and

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,840
we want to go back and we want to try to

01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,360
make sure

01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
our existing products are compliant and

01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,679
secure and the cost of fix

01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,679
every every every time you add a new

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,640
layer it becomes much more expensive to

01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,320
fix things so

01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,320
try to fix these things just like any

01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,679
bug sooner rather than later

01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,520
and if you if you discover these

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,960
problems at sales time

01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,960
this becomes a red alert you know your

01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,320
company your customer runs a scanner

01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,440
against this and finds an open source

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,360
license problem or a security problem

01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,040
guess what that just just destroyed your

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,040
engineering roadmap for the quarter

01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,239
because you're gonna to make the big

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,719
sale you're gonna have to

01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,440
um push out your your your release and

01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,880
fix you know

01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,199
fix the license problem or fix the

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,800
security problem and deals die over this

01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,560
so it's important to

01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,840
understand this and game game it out so

01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,760
you understand what your team needs to

01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,440
do in order to respond to these things

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,719
um there's no excuse to not have

01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,760
everybody have basic training i put a

01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,920
link here

01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,520
for some great open source training open

01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,600
chain also has some great free training

01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,440
that's out there that's self-serve

01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,880
and i do think there's no excuse though

01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,400
um it is sometimes important for the

01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,159
internal there to be kind of the train

01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,400
the trainer person inside

01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,920
um that is sometimes kind of that that

01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:45,199
the the crystal that everything

01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,040
crystal rises around so in terms of

01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,560
remediation strategies

01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,560
um again you don't want to

01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,080
let this go to the end in order to fix

01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,640
these things

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,320
um you know you have a couple ways of

01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,280
fixing things you have the

01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,880
rewind replace or resolve so rewind

01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,239
means you remove the feature

01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,239
you know you had intel you know oh we

01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,679
want to generate pdfs but oh we picked

01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:10,480
the wrong pdf library

01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,800
and it's causing us a licensing problem

01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,520
well

01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,040
remove this print the pdf feature

01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,560
customers might be upset but you no

01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,719
longer have that ip problem no longer

01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,280
that license or vulnerability problem

01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,960
um it's it's kind of doing surgery with

01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,040
an axe it's not very uh

01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,120
not very not a lot of finesse there but

01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,679
sometimes it's a way to very quickly

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,199
resolve a problem um you can replace it

01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,719
that's very common

01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,080
you know you say oh we're never going to

01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,760
be able to comply with this license or

01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,440
it's too expensive to pay for so let's

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,360
go find an alternative or let's go

01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,840
rewrite it in a somewhat clean room

01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,400
if you can or you resolve it so maybe

01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,719
you can

01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,520
um purchase a commercial license to get

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,840
rid of the

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,840
licensing problem you found maybe

01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,800
request new licensing sometimes the open

01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,960
source

01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,719
person picked a certain license not

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,239
because they had a particular philosophy

01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,760
in mind but they just didn't

01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,440
know any other open source licenses you

01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,360
can sometimes request

01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,360
a license that's better for your model

01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,000
you know maybe less copy left maybe more

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,600
copy left depending on what you need

01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,040
you'll sometimes hear developers say oh

01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,560
we'll just make a shim

01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,760
we're gonna write around this oh yeah i

01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,239
know we have a gpl problem but we're

01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,880
gonna make a

01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,239
shim um i typically if i hear start

01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,560
hearing people talking about

01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:20,320
you know shimming around or putting a

01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,800
firewall between the commercial and gpl

01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,480
code

01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,560
it definitely can work could definitely

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,679
happen but i think it's important to get

01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,640
your legal team involved in your

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,880
architecture team

01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,560
involved and understand you know are you

01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,640
really fixing the problem

01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,239
are you just causing you know bad

01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,159
feeling in the open source world

01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:37,360
you know do the right thing you know you

01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,320
might be able to architect your way

01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,719
around it

01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,600
but um sometimes that's a sign that

01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,199
people are

01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,560
just doing a lot of work but i'm not

01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,480
really going to fix the licensing issue

01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,280
there

01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,719
um a lot of this comes up in os in

01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,640
mergers and acquisitions so if you were

01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,719
buying a company or selling a company

01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,080
it's extremely common for you to do open

01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,000
source due diligence

01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,760
um very often with a third party expert

01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,239
you bring in a company who

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,840
is at arm's length takes a look at the

01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:05,199
source code takes a look at the binaries

01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,800
and generates a report

01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,239
you know the the sell side is going to

01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,600
give a bunch of disclosures

01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,600
of the open source and commercial code

01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
they depend on um

01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,280
they'll provide the source code to a

01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,800
third party

01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,920
and then the buy side is going to look

01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
they'll they won't get access to the

01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,320
source code but

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,080
often they'll get a list of the bill of

01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,520
materials and the problems

01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,600
and the buy side might come to you and

01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,920
say here's what we need you to fix

01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,679
or they might they might hold back some

01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,360
money or make the deal worth a little

01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,040
less because of intellectual property or

01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,640
security risk

01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,080
typically you need about two weeks to

01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,000
get that first report and then maybe a

01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,600
few more weeks for remediation

01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,520
um if you think you can do this in a day

01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,280
or two that's not going to work you know

01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,400
build a couple weeks into your project

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,679
and it's really if you're thinking about

01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,760
selling your company i think is really

01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,120
important to start cleaning up things

01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,760
sooner rather than later it looks a lot

01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,000
better

01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,760
um for you and again do it on your

01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,480
timetable as opposed to the m a

01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,840
timetable if you can

01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,960
on the other side you might be releasing

01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,239
something under an open source license

01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,080
we had a question about this in the

01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,560
first kind of the first

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:08,000
part of the session today pick a license

01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,159
that works with your use case

01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,760
some people like very short and sweet

01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,920
very permissive

01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,320
licenses like the mit you know short

01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,760
code sure small project small license

01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,440
sometimes

01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,199
here's my little javascript library it's

01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,719
under an mit license

01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,400
other people are working in an

01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,920
environment where they're maybe they're

01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,320
working in the linux community where the

01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,000
expectation is a gpl license

01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,920
so figure out what community you're in

01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,040
figure out what's the best use case for

01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,280
your license

01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,600
um if you are using open source perhaps

01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,080
as a business model driver

01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,440
maybe you pick a very strong viral

01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,239
license because you want to sell

01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,480
commercial

01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,440
commercial terms to other people again

01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,960
that's that's

01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,560
these are the things that you want to do

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,000
sooner rather than later understand what

01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,199
you're you know why are you dealing with

01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,480
open source why are you dealing with

01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,679
licensing

01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,880
you want to clean up your code before

01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,080
you release it so you might have

01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,960
commercial code in there you're not

01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,400
allowed to ship

01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,159
you don't have the rights to sell or

01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,520
ship

01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:06,080
any images sounds fonts pictures

01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,040
icons they probably have licensing

01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,080
almost certainly have licensing

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,560
associated with them

01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,040
developers are really bad about grabbing

01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,640
video and audio and fonts

01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,560
under and not paying attention to the

01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,400
licensing it's something to figure out

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,000
before you ship something

01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,120
review your open source usage and

01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,320
compliance with your selected license

01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,679
if you're releasing something as open

01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,640
source i do think it's important to do a

01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,440
deep dive with

01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,280
source code snippet scanning you want to

01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,560
figure out where the the cut and pastes

01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,719
are coming from

01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,239
and um especially if you're if your

01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:39,199
library is um

01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:40,960
you know taking code from a you know a

01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,239
brother or sister library you want to

01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,080
make sure that you're you're not doing

01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,920
anything wrong around licensing

01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,360
um sometimes you have to fix your

01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,640
license change your license i've seen a

01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,040
lot of projects where they said oh we

01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,239
want to come out as an apache 20 license

01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,000
and then they find that they have such a

01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,120
dependency on general public license

01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,719
code

01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,040
and there's no easy way to remediate it

01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,679
so they change their license to gpl2 as

01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,920
well

01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,199
so you might be able to fix things or

01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,800
change things but sometimes you

01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,040
you just change your view of what your

01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,880
licensing should be and that's fine

01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,800
um generate your license notices like we

01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,800
saw in the chrome example

01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,080
and then you might decide that it's

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,760
important for you to have things like a

01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,000
contributor licensing agreement

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,199
or a developer certificate of origin a

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,239
code of conduct

01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,159
these are all things that are really

01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,960
important for to build an open source

01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,640
community

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,159
or at least have your community

01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,719
understand what the obligations and

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,840
expectations as community members are

01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,600
and if you're especially if you're

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,719
expecting commercial contributions from

01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,199
companies

01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,800
you may need to see these things as well

01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:39,120
for for your project so

01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,920
um each of those is worth its own

01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,159
session

01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,199
but um things to look at and understand

01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,840
that they might be something that you

01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,760
need to decide upon

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,360
um i think if you're trying to manage

01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,080
open source at a company right now i'm a

01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,640
big believer

01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:55,120
of automated scanning i in my previous

01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,960
life i started a scanning company

01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,239
i think the the amount of open source

01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,120
dependencies that people are depending

01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:02,320
on right now

01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,400
are beyond humans ability to discover

01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,280
and manage is this not fair to humans to

01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,320
make them manage

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,840
hundreds or thousands of items you can

01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,719
manage 50 components maybe in a

01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,880
spreadsheet

01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,880
maybe a team of us can maybe do 500 on a

01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,080
spreadsheet but nobody can manage

01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,679
thousands and thousands

01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,199
and you don't get the security alerts

01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,199
out of a spreadsheet so i think it's

01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,639
important there's some great

01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,000
open source tools that are out there

01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:25,280
there's some great commercial tools that

01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,800
are out there

01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,320
you may already have some of these tools

01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,239
in place if you're using things like

01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,159
maven or npm there's some

01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,760
built-in features and functionality that

01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:35,600
you can get a kickstart

01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,840
of um kind of the open source license

01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,400
management and vulnerability management

01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,679
and um you know these tools make it

01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,320
should make it easy

01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,080
to have your policy put in software have

01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,080
your ability to create bill of materials

01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,600
automatically just by hitting a button

01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,040
and the one of the most important things

01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,000
i think is the security alerts for

01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,159
license alerts

01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,040
especially if you're doing a ci cd

01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,480
process

01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,040
you want to find the problems as soon as

01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,520
they're introduced and resolve them

01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,000
before you ship them or get a big

01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,000
community based on around them

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,920
so very quickly here's a list there's

01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,960
there's i would say probably a couple

01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,600
dozen

01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,120
sca basically open source code scanner

01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,520
tools that are out there right now

01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,960
some built into the repositories some

01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,560
built into the code hosting

01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,760
and others are commercial software that

01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,440
you can download or or purchased

01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,880
i think you can't go wrong with any of

01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,840
these right now they are better than

01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,760
doing

01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,440
nothing the thing to be aware of when

01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,840
you do bring in open source scanning

01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,360
is what are they looking for very often

01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,080
the free tools and even the commercial

01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,000
tools

01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,239
just stop at this first level the

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,120
repository artifacts things like finding

01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:46,080
your

01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:48,320
large compiled libraries like jars or

01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,840
the node modules and things like that

01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,280
that's great that's probably where vast

01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,480
majority of your open source is probably

01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,199
coming in for

01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,239
in terms of the number of libraries

01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,400
you're bringing in

01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:59,679
so you you need to manage repository

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,639
artifacts it's probably the first great

01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,280
place to start

01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,639
um it's pretty non-controversial if it

01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,199
says you're using project a

01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,560
you probably are using project a it's

01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,719
not complete though especially if you're

01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,920
dealing with like the iot or linux or

01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,040
automotive space

01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,719
you're going to need to look at things

01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,239
that are coming in beyond the

01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:20,159
repositories

01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:22,719
for license text copyrights stolen files

01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:25,120
stolen libraries things like that that

01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,719
might be signs of compliance problems or

01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,080
commercial problems things like that

01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:30,239
and all the way down to cut and paste in

01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:32,480
the source code fingerprint world

01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:34,159
so keep that in mind but i think you

01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,960
want to on-ramp with at least the repo

01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,840
artifacts

01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,120
sooner rather than later the source code

01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,920
snippets are important for finding

01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,320
things like

01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,560
um deep gpl violations where people grab

01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,760
code from a library under a copyleft

01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,199
license and bringing it into a

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,719
commercial project

01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,080
it's a lot of work a lot of false

01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,920
positives but i think it's important

01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,600
especially if you are

01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,800
in certain parts of the ecosystem

01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,159
whether you're building open source

01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,400
projects yourselves

01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:03,920
or dealing very closely with linux

01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:05,679
technology or iot technology

01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,600
um i'm going to skip over the sas and

01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,880
ask tools for the interest of time but

01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,719
basically these are ways of finding

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,199
new vulnerabilities whether it's in your

01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:15,199
source code or in your running system

01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,480
i think they're very important to run i

01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:19,040
think especially with the emphasis

01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,080
on software security these days and the

01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,199
reason why it's important

01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:25,280
is your your customers are

01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,800
often going to mandate that you need to

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,920
run sas and das

01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,920
tools as part of the commercial

01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,440
contracts that you're signing

01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,120
you may find that they are also

01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,480
mandating they might not say you need to

01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,760
run an sca tool but they're going to

01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,639
mandate that you need to have a bill of

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,199
materials

01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,159
so sas dast and sca are all tools that

01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,360
you may find yourself in your

01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,480
engineering tide

01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,400
running you can get again

01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,239
many of these are free many of these are

01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,440
commercial it really depends on

01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,120
getting that on-ramp but i think it's

01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,480
important to start that on-ramp and

01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,560
build that knowledge

01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,920
in-house of how to run these tools and

01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,679
how to respond to events that come out

01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,120
of these tools

01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:03,120
okay one real quick call out again for

01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,760
open chain i think open chain is a great

01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,199
project

01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,719
they make it very easy to understand

01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,520
what the expectations are on open source

01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,760
management is

01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,159
they have a great set of resources

01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,120
around training and documentation

01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:15,600
and you're seeing more and more

01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,760
companies um becoming conformant

01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,360
especially now that it's a iso standard

01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,400
um and you can self-certify you don't

01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,320
need to bring somebody else in to

01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,239
certify you though you can if you want

01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,679
you can have somebody um you can pay to

01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:29,840
have somebody get you up to speed on it

01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,920
so last thing here i'll just say kind of

01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,639
a list of best practices

01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,600
i am a huge believer of using technology

01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,360
to build your bomb

01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,639
i actually think it's i used to say

01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,639
start with education

01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,239
i am coming around to the start with

01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:43,920
scanning

01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,760
training can take a long time you want

01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,320
to get that in place but i think if you

01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,239
are

01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,679
starting some place and you want to make

01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,840
an impact right away

01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,960
run a tool find some problems start

01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,480
fixing them and then build your

01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,920
education and your policy plan around

01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,199
what you're finding

01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,639
generate those notice reports and

01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,000
notices don't make somebody have to deal

01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:03,520
with them in spreadsheets

01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,480
it's the 21st century keep track of your

01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,840
source code

01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,600
especially keep track of your commercial

01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,199
libraries and dependencies keep track of

01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,960
payments and eulas anytime somebody

01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:12,719
clicks i agree i agree

01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,639
that should be saved someplace because

01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,960
you signed up to do something legal

01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:19,120
track web services i think it's very

01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,600
overlooked part of the world here is

01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,760
more and more apis are being consumed as

01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,760
web services

01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,040
those might not be open source but

01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,719
they're dependencies and the

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:32,320
dependencies might be commercial

01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,280
they might be have a eula or a service

01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,040
level agreement

01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,320
and it may be something that gets cut

01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,600
off in production

01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,760
you know if you're in testing you do

01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,320
five hits a day maybe no problem but if

01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,239
you go

01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,920
if you if you go public and suddenly

01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,520
it's five million hits on that web

01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,280
service a day that person on the other

01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,400
end of that api might shut you down

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,320
so it's important to know what your

01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,880
dependencies on web services are

01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,800
and what the um expectations for service

01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,639
level agreements and whatnot

01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,000
track your open source source files mark

01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:02,000
them appropriately never ever

01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
clip or cut away license text or

01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,280
copyright text

01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,239
if you're dealing with codex audio video

01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,840
things like that

01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,280
check out for patent issues and patent

01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,719
licensing

01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,800
do look at your cves and your

01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:17,679
vulnerability reports um

01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,880
go download the owasp dependency check

01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,280
tool it's free

01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,000
it's easy to run you your eyes will be

01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,639
very open

01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,679
um once you run that great on-ramp all

01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,719
you know even if you're going to pick a

01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,480
commercial tool

01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,760
um great way to understand what's there

01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,760
um as well

01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,679
if you can run sas and dashed really

01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,600
start to build that knowledge in-house

01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:36,960
and then keep doing this it's it's one

01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,639
thing to do at once and then

01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,639
let that age out two years three years

01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,239
four years i think the time to be able

01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,360
to do that is long past i think this is

01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,639
something that needs to just be part of

01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,679
your sprint planning

01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:49,440
and your policies internally so

01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,199
things learned along the way before we

01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,400
go to questions compliance is still very

01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,840
personality driven

01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,679
very often you have only one or two

01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,400
people max at a company no matter how

01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,080
big you are

01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,760
who really care about this or know about

01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,600
this and when they leave

01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,679
the plot the policies and processes

01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,719
often fall apart our job is to make sure

01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,159
that there's more than just

01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,159
one or two people in a company that

01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,560
understands this experience levels are

01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,800
different

01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,760
definitely very very greatly you might

01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,400
talk to somebody

01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,679
and they are the most knowledgeable open

01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,120
source in the world somebody a different

01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,639
company of the same title

01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,719
don't know anything about licensing et

01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:23,360
cetera

01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,719
understand that um the bomb inventory

01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,440
just because somebody produces a bill of

01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,440
materials

01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,280
i never trust them they're very often

01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,199
under counting the true dependencies

01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,800
it depends on what tool and what person

01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:35,600
and also kind of

01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,480
how how open the company wants to be you

01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,400
can sometimes find

01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,520
10 libraries or a thousand libraries for

01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,199
that same scan

01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,120
depending on the vendor you pick or the

01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,880
person that runs it so understand that

01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,600
that you might not be getting the full

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,440
full picture an analysis paralysis it's

01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,120
very easy to not make a decision because

01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,520
you're scared about choices

01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,760
my philosophy is start making choices

01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,880
start start understanding start fixing

01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,639
things

01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,000
and it's an art not a science you know

01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,280
you're going to learn along the way

01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,080
nobody nobody um is ready to start

01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,639
holy wholly born today you learn by

01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,440
doing

01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:11,040
and uh start doing so with that i'm

01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,480
going to

01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,560
move to q a because we're finding

01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,080
ourselves at the end of the time here

01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,320
and like i said if you have any

01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,600
questions follow up on twitter or

01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,120
through my website

01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,800
if we don't get a chance to answer your

01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,159
question today so i want to thank you

01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:29,360
again for your time and let's see if

01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:32,560
there's any q a

01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:34,239
okay um somebody

01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,679
um asked if it would be possible to get

01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,760
a recording of the session yes there

01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,000
will be recordings of these sessions

01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,040
um both uh the morning session and this

01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,440
evening session

01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,800
um be posted usually it takes uh maybe

01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,920
one or two weeks for them to get up

01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,199
there i believe they'll be

01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,600
listed okay um someone addie

01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:53,520
asks what about the open source security

01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:57,120
foundation any thoughts

01:28:53,520 --> 01:29:00,719
um i think this is this is the um

01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,800
open ssf this is a new

01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,000
organization that i think is doing some

01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,719
really great work

01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,400
i think these are um it's an important

01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,000
project to follow

01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,840
it's important because it's really

01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,080
looking at the core infrastructure that

01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,639
is

01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,239
causing um you know it's not that

01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,480
they're causing problems it's just that

01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:20,239
the the core infrastructure that often

01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,080
is targeted by people who want to break

01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:23,920
into your company or causing

01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,520
um security problems so i think they are

01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:28,080
a great project to watch

01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,159
i i follow their stuff on twitter i

01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,400
think if you are at a big fortune 50

01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:33,840
company or iot or automotive it's very

01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,400
important for you to be aware of the

01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,000
open

01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,679
open source security foundation and

01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,719
especially the alerts that are coming

01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,400
out from them

01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,000
though they are i think they're well

01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,280
informed and they know what they're

01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,080
doing and if they're saying something's

01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,920
a problem

01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:49,280
