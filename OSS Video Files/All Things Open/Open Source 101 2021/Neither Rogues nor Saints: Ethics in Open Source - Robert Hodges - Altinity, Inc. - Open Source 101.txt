Title: Neither Rogues nor Saints: Ethics in Open Source - Robert Hodges - Altinity, Inc. - Open Source 101
Publication date: 2021-04-10
Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Robert Hodges, CEO of Altinity, Inc., delivered the talk "Neither Rogues nor Saints: Ethics in Open Source" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Open-source software has unleashed a flood of innovation and created amazing, worldwide communities. It has also exposed tricky ethical quandaries. Do maintainers owe bug fixes to open source users? Should open-source companies relicense code from community users to make more money? Do users have an obligation to be welcoming to other users? To answer these we’ll need to think about what it means to be “ethical” in open source communities. First, we’ll explore a reasonable set of mutual obligations that help communities function better. Next, we’ll discuss how to structure projects to make it easier to uphold obligations without being a saint. Finally, we’ll consider how to escape obligations you can’t meet without acting like a rogue. Open-source ethics are intensely personal and I don’t claim to have the answers. I hope this talk will help you find them yourself and make your projects better for you and the community around you.

i'd like to start this out before i get

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,559
into the talk by thanking both mark as

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,480
well as the

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,160
open source 101 conference for having

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
this talk it's a it's a real pleasure to

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,400
be here

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
and um i hope to uh to live up to the

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,279
privilege

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,279
i the talk i'm going to give today is

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
called neither saints nor rogues

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,920
ethics in open source and

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
um this is my ethics is a is a tricky

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
business

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,280
everybody has their own versions of them

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,239
so i want to just say up front this is

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
my personal take on how to run open

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,640
source projects large and

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
in and small in an ethical way it's not

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
the only way to think about it

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
i hope that you'll find the framing of

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
the problem is useful but

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,920
that it will help and that this will

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
help you to come to conclusions that

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,760
work for you

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,440
so let me first dive in and talk a

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
little bit about myself

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
and where i work because this has

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
bearing on why i have any ideas about

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,519
this whole subject

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,640
to begin with so i'm a database geek

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,439
i've been working on databases for over

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,479
30 years i started in 1983.

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,600
uh most have worked about on about 20

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,000
different kinds

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
and some of them i worked on for a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
decade

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119
others i worked on for a day long enough

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
to realize i hated them

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
i started learning how to code when i

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,960
was a kid in 1972 so it'll be 50 years

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880
next year next january and back in those

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
days we started with paper tape

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,439
and i wrote programs on cards it's

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
obviously changed a lot since then but

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,560
it's still a really fun

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
uh really a really great thing to work

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000
on

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,439
and in the last 15 or so years i've

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
worked on or been associated with

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,479
multiple

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
open source projects and we'll talk a

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
little bit about those

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
going on but a big one was my sequel and

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
then um

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
another one is click house so that

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,479
brings me to my

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,360
my company so i'm the ceo of a company

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,320
called altenet

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,239
and what we do is we market a database

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,920
called click house so we style ourselves

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,080
as enterprise provider

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,000
and we're helping people this clickhouse

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
is a really popular

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
sql data warehouse that's licensed

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
apache2o

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
and so as part of our business we're

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,360
obviously very concerned about the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,959
community we're very concerned about the

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
success of the project

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
so we sponsor events and we also do a

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
lot of commits into the project itself

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
uh we're actually the number two

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
committers in the community both in turn

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
both in terms of click house as well as

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,360
some of the ecosystem projects

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,879
so we have a deep and abiding interest

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
in this community

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
helping to make it stronger as well as

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
other communities that are associated

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
with it

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
so that's a little about me in the and

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
the company let me

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
tell you a little bit about click house

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,440
uh if you haven't heard it

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
about it this is an interesting project

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
it

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,200
was originally developed by yandex and

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
um the way that it got started was they

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
were doing web analytics

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,760
uh they had a a pro a uh where had a

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
system called metrica and it's kind of

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,879
like a russian version of google

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
analytics

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
and what you want to do is be able to

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,280
enable to allow people to answer

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
just general questions about the traffic

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
on on websites

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
and you know sort of where'd the traffic

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,680
come from and then

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
uh given where the traffic came from

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
what's the first page they landed on you

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
know sort of slicing and dicing types of

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,360
things

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,040
and this is a problem that you

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
traditionally answer with

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
a type of database called a data

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
warehouse

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
which is designed for reading very large

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
amounts of data

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
and coming back with quick responses

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
well

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,120
to make a long story short yandex was

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,640
looking for an open source data

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
warehouse that would do this or one that

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
was a proprietary one that's reasonable

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
cheap they couldn't find it

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
so a guy named alexey millavidov

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
starting in 2008 wrote his own

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and it worked and it under

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
it it drives this this metrica uh

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
product

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,000
it worked so well that they ended up

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,840
using it for a bunch of other um

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
things in-house yandex is a pretty big

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
company it's kind of like it's almost

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
like a silicon valley startup

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
except that their headquarters is

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
located in moscow and so they're using

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
it for all of the kinds of use cases

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
like

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,919
monitoring network logs

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,919
doing things like examining service logs

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,759
uh doing observability so on and so

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,639
forth

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,400
at um alexi was it worked so well that

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,479
alexis was able to persuade them to open

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
source it in 2016

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,800
and it has grown very rapidly since then

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
it's now one of the largest

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
database projects on github in fact by

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
one measure it's the

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,919
second in on github after elasticsearch

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,960
the folks that are sponsoring this track

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,720
here's just a few

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,360
stats on the project uh from uh

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,280
starting in in december 220 2020 i

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,880
didn't rerun the numbers but

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
the number of people who've contributed

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
actually done a pull request

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
is now well over 700 it was 684 back in

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
december

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,039
i saw those are unique github users uh

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
almost 2 000 people in december had

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,600
already opened

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,479
at least one issue uh 2800

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
trending toward 2900 it had forked the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
code

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
and of course a bunch of people had

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,039
started the repo so it's a

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
it's a really a very popular project

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,000
tremendously large community

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,600
which takes contributions from people

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,440
literally all over the world so

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
that actually means that we have some

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
interest as i said before in running

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,720
communities but

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,199
what got me thinking about ethics was

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
not this project but the previous thing

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,440
that i worked on

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,360
which was in the my sequel community

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,280
so the company that i worked at before

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
this was a little company called

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
continuant that still exists and they

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,919
actually still maintain this product i'm

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,759
going to talk about

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,039
and i was ceo of that company and we

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,639
wrote something called the tungsten

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
replicator which was kind of like an

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,000
open source golden gate

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,600
and it was licensed under gpl v2 it

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,840
um could do things like parallel

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
replication from my sequel which was

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,880
it was actually the first software that

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
did this it

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,319
could load data from my sequel to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
redshift or hadoop or

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,440
later on um uh others as well

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
so it was actually quite successful and

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
we

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
we went through a number of it to make a

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,600
long story short

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
it was a big reason for the success of

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,560
the company because

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,000
we were really selling as it turned out

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
database clustering and high

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
availability to mysql users

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,840
the tungsten replicator was the thing

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,400
that made the copies of the

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
of the databases so that we could do

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
things like

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
failover and um because we're in an open

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
source community and selling to a lot of

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
open source users

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
it was very helpful to have part of the

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,919
product be open source

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,319
and um and so you know we allowed people

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,639
to

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
to use it freely um they could fork it

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
they could do whatever they wanted as

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,039
long as it was gpl v2 compliant

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,680
and um and everything was happy and in

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,800
the end

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,000
um things turned out well for us and we

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,440
sold the company

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,599
to vmware in 2014.

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,400
well that led to a teaching moment

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,440
which i was searching for an xk cd

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,319
cartoon

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
that would describe it and i couldn't

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
find one so i made my own

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,000
uh basically we were totally jazzed that

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
we had sold the company

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,840
uh for a bunch of reasons and uh

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,199
so i stood up in front of a conference

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,599
right after we've sold it

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
and you know said yay we sold the

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
company to vmware

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
nothing's going to change it's going to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,520
be great you know we have all these

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
resources from vmware

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
and it's going to just make things even

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,879
better than they are right now

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
and there were about 300 people in the

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,560
room and i think

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,479
the people who were listening probably

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,879
said the ones who had any experience in

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,360
this

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,120
in this topic of like what happens when

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,639
you sell a company probably went huh

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,280
right so this got me to thinking because

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,599
of course

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
we you know once we went to vmware uh

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,199
things were quite different

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,039
we had a lot less control just writing a

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,080
blog article for example took two and a

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
half months

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
in some cases uh it was very difficult

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
to get to do open source things at the

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
time so

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,159
it got me thinking well you know is that

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
something

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,000
that i could have done better because

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,760
obviously what was i was

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you know this was happening but i wasn't

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
really thinking about the future

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,959
and so as as a result it really got me

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
thinking about

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
how can you you know how can you get you

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
know what kind of dilemmas

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,240
actually come up in open source and how

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,959
can you navigate your way through them

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
and as you look at open source projects

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,360
regardless of the size

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,519
there tend to be a number of standard

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
questions that come up not all projects

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,600
have them

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
but most projects have some fraction of

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
these

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
questions as well as others like do i

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,160
owe bug fixes to people who use my code

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
so they you know i wrote something it's

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,440
popular it breaks

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,120
do i have to fix it for them what

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
happens if something changes in my life

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
and i have to bail out of the project

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,080
how do i do that

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
do i have to take pull requests so most

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,279
projects these days are either on github

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,519
or git lab

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,120
but a big chunk of them on get github

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,519
and pull requests are standard way to do

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
changes to have to take them

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,360
how should i behave you know if i'm just

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,200
a member of some open source project and

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
regardless of capacity how should i

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
behave to

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,160
to other users and then finally one that

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,240
hits the news pretty often is can i

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
re-license is it fair to people

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
if i realize it's my software because i

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,959
need to make money

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,320
so these are are really common problems

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,240
that come up

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,560
and it's the um

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,079
and so you know kind of like the what i

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,200
went through where if you don't think

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
about these

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
it's sometimes sort of hard to navigate

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
even well first of all anticipate these

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
problems

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,040
and then navigate through them uh when

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,560
they actually arise

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,040
and the the issue here is that

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,320
very few people are like voldemort sort

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,440
of the guy on the

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,720
on the right um that played by ralph

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,959
fines in the

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,079
in the uh um in the in the um

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,160
in the movies uh but also very few of us

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,079
are like nelson mandela people who have

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
discipline and are able to

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,279
you know think carefully about ethical

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
issues and and

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
and sort of work their way through them

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
sometimes without a lot of outside

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,440
guidance

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,120
most of us are just in the middle and so

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
what we need is some basic rules that we

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
can

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,000
follow that help us deal

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,560
with open source projects and run them

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,279
in in a reasonable way that doesn't mess

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,640
with other people who belong to them

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,399
well fortunately it turns out that

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
this is not the first time that this

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,040
question has arisen

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
so there's something called ethics which

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
which humans have been studying actually

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,000
for thousands of years

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,279
and this is a definition of ethics that

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,680
i found on the bbc television

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,040
site it was on just randomly on one of

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,279
their pages but i think it's a pretty

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,480
good definition of what ethics are

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,640
it's a system of moral principles

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,600
concerning what's good for individuals

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
that is people like us sort of each one

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
of us

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,519
as well as society at large so

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
that's a pretty big definition and one

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
of the questions that comes up in

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
in open source is what do we mean by

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,680
society

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
so as we look at ethics you can think of

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,079
societies

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,120
coming some scope

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,279
and when you know that regardless of

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
what we do we tend to have

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
we tend to belong different kinds of

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
social units

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
ranging from very small to very large so

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
for example

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
you have your family you have a company

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
perhaps that you work village that you

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
live in or city

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,680
you you are a member of a nation and

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,320
also obviously we all live on planet

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,240
earth

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
so these are all societal units and we

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
have

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
we belong to them and have some level of

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,160
obligation to each of them

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,160
now what's nice about open source is

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,720
that there is this very natural

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,480
social unit which is the soci which is

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,600
the open source community

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
and virtually every single uh open

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
source

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
project has this at some level now it

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
may consist of just one person posting

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,040
the code

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,160
but it could actually in some cases

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
include

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,240
hundreds of thousands or or even

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,200
millions of people

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,040
so when we're thinking about behaving

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
ethically in open source

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,959
the focus is i think that makes sense

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,320
is to look at how you will behave inside

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
open source communities

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
so my definition which i haven't seen

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,959
this written down anywhere but i just

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
put this together with that bbc

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639
definition so basically when you're

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,040
thinking about open source ethics

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,240
what you're talking about is how to

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,120
recognize

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
and fulfill your obligations to the open

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,600
source community

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,240
or communities that you belong to and so

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,680
what we're going to look at is some

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,240
specific ways that this can happen

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,959
now i think it's useful to look a little

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,519
bit more closely at what open source

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,800
communities actually look like and what

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,360
kind of people

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,120
and or entities if you will belong to

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
them so

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
this is different of course for every

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
project there's sort of a different

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,560
constellation of

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,480
folks that join the projects but

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,560
generally speaking if a project gets

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,079
large enough you're going to find a

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,399
number of standard

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
sort of roles that emerge and and that

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
can characterize

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
the different members of the community

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,399
first of all you have committers the

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,519
people who actually wrote the code in

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
the open source

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,519
project and do the commits to actually

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
get something changed in github for

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
example or

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,240
spin the crank to do a build or do a

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,160
release

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,000
you have end users so people who

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,959
actually use the code

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,160
either because they embedded it in their

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
in software

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,800
or because they used it in some other

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,320
capacity you also as things get large

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
get other kinds of contributors

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
sometimes

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,040
people are halfway between end users and

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,760
committers they meet people

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
who use the software can also do commits

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,800
on it

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,480
and then you have advocates people who

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,760
are interested in it talk about it at

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
conferences

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,959
and then finally you have commercial

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
entities so you have actually companies

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,760
that often arise

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,839
to help you know that make money

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,600
directly or indirectly from the open

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,120
source software

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,800
and what happens is as these

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,560
groups of people collaborate together

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
in the open source community you get

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,160
this very powerful engine

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,600
for value creation and i've sort of

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
outlined in the

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
in this box some of the ways that that

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
people participate

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,480
and what what are the actual benefits

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,880
that they bring to the project because

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
what happens in in open source projects

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,120
is they and and

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,519
through communities is you effectively

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
recreate a lot of the functions that we

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,600
previously only saw

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
in proprietary software companies so for

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,160
example

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
obviously committers do you know they

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,199
have the roadmap so the long-term design

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
features bug fixes they do basic qa you

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
have the end users

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
who are doing everything from helping

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
you to define the requirements

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,000
either by explicitly telling you or

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,880
squeaking loudly if you do

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,560
if you get it wrong all the way to to

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
providing marketing when they tell their

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
friends they tell their neighbors they

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,160
tell their boss that this is great

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,519
software that

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
that you should use and then you have

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
all these other folks in between like

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,160
the advocates

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,399
who present at conferences write

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,519
documentation write blog articles

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
and also help organize the community

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
you have these other contributors doing

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
your code fixes documentation field

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
marketing you know helping to set a

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,800
set uh set meetups and then finally the

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
commercial entities

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,839
which as things get larger provide the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,720
funding that helps pay for conferences

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,360
um like swag and things like that does

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,560
the build infrastructure does systematic

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,720
qa and and and helps uh with legal

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,079
uh which sooner or later you actually do

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
need and so what you can see

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,320
is these are these are as i said

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,920
recapitulating what's happening

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
in what used to happen just in

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,160
proprietary software companies

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
and it turns out they can be incredibly

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
productive

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
when the community works well together

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,399
so for example the most popular

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,759
operating system on earth is the linux

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
operating system

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
drawn from a huge community of people it

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,720
gets thousands of commits in every

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,880
release or thousands of

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,039
contributors in every release the most

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
popular database on the planet is almost

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
certainly

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
um

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,400
well it was my it was my sequel but um

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,199
ah don't have a brain a brain spasm here

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
um

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,559
i'll come back to it it's written by

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,839
richard hipp it's uh i don't

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,679
actually work on it which is why i'm

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,080
having a uh so

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,320
my c it has been phenomenally popular in

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
um

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,240
sort of in fact in data in general open

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
source has been tremendously productive

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
and some of the largest and most popular

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
systems

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,960
are are based on

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,520
open source projects and actually it's

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,600
interesting

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,720
in covid what we've seen is that the

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,480
the open source approach has actually

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
been applied in a lot of the work on

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
covid vaccines where there's this

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
tremendous

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
sharing of information about the the um

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
the dna

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,280
of the covet virus as well as

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,799
progress on scientific papers these have

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,320
been

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,559
shared in a very open source like

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,880
fashion and through this community

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
it has helped turbocharge the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
development of vaccines

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
so this is a really really powerful

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
model for developing technology and

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,080
writing software

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,080
now if we're doing open source

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,000
we have of course open source licenses

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,640
and one of the questions you might ask

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,600
is well as you're running

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,360
this community do open source how do

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,240
open source licenses fit in

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,480
and and do they actually help you

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,640
organize the community

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,520
i think in general the answer to that is

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,720
no

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,039
the um they don't really tell people

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,799
how to behave or how to to interact with

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
each other the license are really

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,799
licenses are really just contracts for

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
code use and i've given a few examples

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,280
here there are many others and

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
new ones keep emerging but they're

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,880
contracts for

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,559
open source code use and they they have

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,760
a couple things like all contracts they

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,320
have rights

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
so generally speaking all of them every

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,840
open source license

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
allows you to see to use to alter the

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,880
open source code

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,280
they also imply

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
or provide certain responsibilities

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,440
which can range from

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,520
hey if you link with this a library

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,720
that's licensed for example in

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,000
gpl v2 any code that links with it also

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
has to be released as

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
open source that's a fairly restrictive

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
form of licensing

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
in terms of you know putting more

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,960
responsibility

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,320
on the users they can go all the way to

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
bsd and

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,080
mit licenses which are very permissive

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,280
really all you have to have is a notice

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,559
but you can do anything you want in

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,720
with the um with the uh

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
with the code as long as you say hey it

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,640
was originally

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,679
from this open source project so the

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
licenses don't

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,559
really tell us how to structure the

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,320
communities what they do is they make

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
some questions that relate to

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
communities

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,120
go away because they're just things you

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,640
can do and this this is where the

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
freedoms are really important so for

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
example

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
can i fork the code do i want to do

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,720
something you know new with it or start

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,280
a new project yeah absolutely you can do

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,320
that

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,559
the license provides it can i

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
go ahead and take the code change it do

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,840
something interesting and not contribute

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,840
back to the upstream project

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,000
yes you can do that too that's not

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,919
required by any license that i open

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
source license that i know of

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,360
can i use it to make money uh you can do

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
that as well

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,880
the it's a little harder than you might

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
think and we'll talk about that because

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
that's

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,520
that's that's actually creates some some

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,919
issues with open source

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,440
ethics but absolutely you can do that

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,679
every open source license

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
allows you to do this although they may

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
place conditions

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
on your code depending on how you're

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,720
making money

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,159
so uh so that is uh

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
you know so all of these things are

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,520
freedoms that

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,840
that are granted and they're not really

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
ethical uh questions these are just

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,720
things that you're allowed to do

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,200
under the contract what is an ethical

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,120
question is something like the following

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,559
do committers owe bug fixes to their

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,320
users

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,520
and what i'm going to do is i'm just

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,960
going to wade into some of these

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
questions and i'm going to give my take

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,200
on it

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
again which this what works for me i'm

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,240
going to show you that at the end i

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
think there's some fairly basic rules

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,200
that unify

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,440
all of these answers and you'll start to

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,120
see them emerging as we go through

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,559
so do committers owe bug fixes to users

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,919
well the answer

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,960
is no they don't um what

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,240
i think committers owe their users

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,400
is an appropriate way to fix problems

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,760
that's a much better way of framing the

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
project and

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
that could actually be nothing so for

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
example if you're

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
just posting code because you're giving

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
an example uh

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
it's probably not important to fix it

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,159
but the more that people depend on your

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,919
code

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,280
the more important is that for example

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
if there's a security issue there's some

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,480
way to get it fixed

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,840
so that it doesn't affect a bunch of

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,200
people but

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
there's all kinds of models for doing

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,760
this and they range from everything

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,760
where you as a committer do every single

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
fix and all you ask for people to do is

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
just

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
hey report it you know give me a hint in

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
fact give me a full description of the

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,919
bug

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,880
all the way to hey join the project if

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,960
you've got to fix

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
i'll give you admin rights you can come

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,760
in and just put the fix in yourself

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
so you can pick whichever model makes

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,919
the most sense but

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,039
the point is that from from an ethics

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
perspective

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,960
you do owe this to your users to have

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
some way of fix

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
fixing problems because they've made

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
some commitment to use this software

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
they're helping you develop the

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
community

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,919
and and so this is something this is

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,039
something that you should just do

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,520
so it's a it's a the the ground reason

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,440
here is you're valuing the contribution

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,520
of your of your users and you're doing

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,360
something to them all right for them

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,880
in return so

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
digging a little deeper on this what

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,360
about accepting pull requests

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,799
so and and the talk that came before

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,679
this by ben nuttall

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,520
put this really well that you pull

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,880
requests are really

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,200
are a really sort of fundamental part of

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
most

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,520
large particularly of large open source

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
projects but even small ones

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,799
basically if you're not familiar with

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,760
them what that means is somebody

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,360
forks your code on on github they make

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,200
changes and then they ask you to

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,400
incorporate the changes back

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
from your fork into the into the um into

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,760
your code

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,640
the original project and what's really

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,400
important here

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,840
is you don't have to accept uh prs

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,039
there's a bunch of reasons why you might

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,640
not do them they might not be

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,480
appropriate

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
you might just say hey this is too

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
dangerous to be done by ordinary

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,360
civilians i'm going to

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,640
rework anything that people tell me so

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,760
there's a bunch of reasons why you might

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
not do this

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
but i think the key value here is to be

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,600
really respectful

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,919
of the work that goes into prs people

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,279
sometimes spend weeks doing this

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,720
so if you don't accept prs or depending

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,880
on the level that you accept you should

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,039
be really open about where you stand so

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,760
for example if you don't accept p horse

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,120
prs at all just say so just say we don't

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,559
accept prs on this

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,559
and let people know so they won't waste

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,919
their time or

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,320
suggest how they can how they can

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
you know ask for changes if you don't

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
have time to review

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
just say so one of the best responses i

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
got was

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,400
actually a few weeks ago we were trying

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,200
to fix some python drivers for

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,559
a project that we depend on and we're

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
trying to fix some problems for one of

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,520
our customers

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
and um the guy running it said hey i've

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
got a i've got a day job i probably

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
won't be able to look at this till the

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,400
weekend

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,919
and he was just really upfront about it

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
when the weekend rolled around he looked

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,279
at it merged it

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,000
spun a build and it was great and so he

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,039
set expectations really nicely

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,880
and and it it was it was respectful it

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,080
was easy for us to work with

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,679
and then finally if you do take pr's and

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,880
pr has has problems it's important to

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,880
say

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
why the why it had you know if you if

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
you're accepting prs

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,159
say why it has problems and give people

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,240
some hint about how to fix it

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,200
these are all things that are that show

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,039
respect

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
for the work that people are putting in

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
and help them

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,919
incorporate this into into your project

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
in a way that's going to make the

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,799
project grow

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,159
so i think this one is is pretty

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,320
important and i think

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,840
one of the places where i see projects

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
tend to lag a little bit as they just

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,919
get overwhelmed

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,760
in prs so this is this is an important

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,120
topic to think about

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,360
you know how you're gonna deal with this

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,279
and and how you're gonna you know

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,000
sort of help your help your users make

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,000
changes for you

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,919
one another common question that comes

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,480
up is

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,360
must i welcome other community members

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,799
and

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,919
i think in most in most

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,000
ethical questions around open source the

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
answers are not always clear yes or no

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,039
but this one for me is a really strong

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,320
yes

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,080
and the reason for that is that there's

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,480
just this basic rule to

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
treat community members as you would

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,520
like to be treated yourself it's the

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
golden rule so people are in your

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
community

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,679
if you want to be treated decently you

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,159
should do the same to other people it is

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,480
a really really fundamental value that

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,919
transcends open source and really

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,279
applies in

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
any community that i can think of that

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,640
certainly any community i can think of

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,480
that i would want to be a member of

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,120
so so so yes you absolutely should be

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,799
welcoming

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,240
you should you know do your best to make

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,760
you know to make people feel that hey

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,440
they're joining a community where their

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
their what their contribution

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
is whatever it is it is appreciated it

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
is valued

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
and and um and and you're glad they're

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
there

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,760
beyond that follow the conventions of

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,640
the community every community does this

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,320
differently

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,679
and sort of is welcoming in different

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
ways and have appropriate ways to

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
communicate that

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,039
uh there were previous talks in this

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,640
track that talked about that

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
you can think how to do that but i think

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,399
being welcoming is just a it's just like

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,919
a solid yes something you should always

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,279
do

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,039
and um however you know sometimes it's

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,559
it's hard yeah there's a lot of there's

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,039
only so many hours in the

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,320
in the day so it's sometimes useful if

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,480
you want if you're ambitious and you

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
want your project to be big

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,960
or popular or make money or whatever

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,080
it's sometimes helpful to remember that

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,399
being welcoming

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,000
helps projects grow faster so this is

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,600
not just a

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
this is not just something you you

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,799
should do

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,840
you know for for ethical reasons it's

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,919
something that actually helps your

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,640
project grow stronger and

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,640
and um and and have a larger reach and

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
just two examples that are really top of

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
mind for me

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
my sequel grew phenomenally fast because

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
it built this huge community

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,520
the the my sequel my sql ab did a really

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
great job of this

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,720
and they accepted a wide range of

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,080
contributions they accepted bug

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,360
which included bug reports code fixes um

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,080
of course they they sponsored

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,880
conferences they they had meetups

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,720
there were many many contributions that

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,880
that built my sequel into the powerhouse

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,000
that it became in the early 2000s

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,520
and this so this this huge community

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
that they successfully built was one of

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,279
their key success factors

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
the database that i work on right now

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,240
click house has also grown phenomenally

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
fast

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,159
because it's taken thousands of of

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,679
external prs

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,559
so for example there are substantial

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,080
chunks of the sql implementation in

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,919
click house that were um

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,000
submitted by external companies that are

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,320
just interested in seeing click house

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,440
be a better sql data warehouse and this

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,240
has helped the date

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,240
this has helped click house grow really

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
really fast

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,600
and if that's not enough one other thing

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,640
i should mention

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,799
is that most modern

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,279
commercial open source companies now

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,520
fund what's called a developer advocate

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,360
and their job is to welcome community

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,120
members make them feel at home

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,799
show them how to you know find

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
information be productive and so on and

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,720
so forth

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,880
so even if you don't believe it

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
personally just you should remember that

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,919
hey vcs do

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and these are people who actually want

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
the projects to be successful for

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,600
economic reasons

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,919
so this is this is really important now

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
one of the i think one of the issues

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,039
that other talks

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,159
today have touched on and this is one

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,640
which is

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
is a tricky one for open source projects

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,320
is

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,600
must i in my project whether as an owner

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,159
in my role in the project

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,039
must i solve societal problems of which

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,640
there are many

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,679
so for example lack of diversity

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,720
racism misogyny global warming

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,679
there's a pretty substantial chunk

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,120
of of problems that you can think about

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,159
and try to address

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,600
as part of your open source project for

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
me the question

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,520
on this on this particularly as a

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,440
project owner is

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,360
when you say must i solve these problems

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,679
or work to solve these problems

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,880
the answer is if you want if it's

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
important to you

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,799
i think it's always critical to uphold

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,640
the golden rule sort of

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
within your community very clearly to

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,799
treat people

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,039
as you'd like to be treated but i think

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,799
the real reason why open source projects

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,440
tend to go down this

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,640
this path is you know as even as as

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
members of open source

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,880
beyond our communities beyond our open

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,120
source community we belong to many other

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,679
groups in society we have obligations to

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,679
them

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,840
and they don't end when we when we come

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,840
in and do code fixes for example

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,679
so if you feel that those obligations

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,000
are important you should

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,000
you're definitely it's it's something

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,559
that you can make part of your project

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,799
i think it is important to be open about

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,399
the project values and the conventions

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,880
so if this is something that you believe

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,399
in say so and make it clear to people

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,080
make it clear to people who join the

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,440
community how they can help uphold it

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
with you

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,960
so that's an important i think this is

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,559
an important topic and

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,159
and something that that you need to

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,200
think about but there isn't really a

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
clear answer

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
and certainly if your project is small

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
maybe you're just focused on code if

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
it's large

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,880
these are things you'll have to think

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:36,240
about more deeply

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,279
now the other thing that comes up when

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,320
you're

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,799
when you're dealing with large projects

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,080
is is it okay to re-license the project

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,000
to make money this

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,000
makes the news quite a bit where you

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,519
have commercial companies that at some

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,679
stage decide hey you know for

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,200
various reasons you know for reasons x y

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,200
and z um

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,600
we're we believe that we need to

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,679
re-license the project because

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,720
we're afraid of competition or because

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
we're not

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
you know we're having problems making

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,640
money with the existing license um

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
so is it okay to do this and i think the

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
answer is yes

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,720
but um the

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
you know obviously if you own the

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,480
copyrights to the code

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,399
there's no question that you have the

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,679
right and or if you have code that's

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,720
submitted using a

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,880
um a cla which is where the

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
uh contributor signs away their rights

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
to the copyright

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,080
you have the right to do this it's in

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,240
the open source you know it's

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,519
it's it's it's legally something that

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,880
you can do

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,640
the thing that you need to remember

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
though is a lot of people have

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,720
contributed to these projects so i think

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,159
if you're going to re-license

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,960
you know be honest about it why are you

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,519
doing it um to say that

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,960
that you know it's uh oh because it's

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,399
going to make the community better well

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,760
you know a lot of re-licensing actually

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,519
doesn't do that

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,279
because it puts more restrictions for

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,880
example on how the code can be used so

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
for some people in the community

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,399
that's not going to help them the other

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,880
thing that is

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,240
is another thing is that you want to

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,720
think about

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,600
who got you to into this position in the

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,600
first place so

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,440
the people who helped even the you know

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
their end users even if they did nothing

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
else

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,279
but tell their friend that this is a

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,399
great project they have helped your

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,360
project

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,200
and so as you re-license you have some

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,240
duty to think about hey

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,919
what you know what did they contribute

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,519
and then finally you want to think about

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,559
the business early on

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,679
this is something with open source that

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,480
i think not everybody understands but

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
there's just some basic realities that

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,880
you have to deal with

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,480
so in the you know for commercial open

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,600
source particularly vc

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,240
funded you have kind of a an ideal model

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,159
you've got a super popular project maybe

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,880
it has tens of thousands or 100 000 or a

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
million

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,159
million users or or downloads whatever

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
metric of

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
adoption you have you take venture

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,519
funding

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,600
and uh you work for a few years and then

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
you get a billion dollar payout

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,040
well and i'm not making this number up

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,639
that is the real number that

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,879
if you go to somebody like anderson

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,119
horowitz or or take money from

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,320
you know any of the you know sort of san

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,359
francisco

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,879
early stage venture capital uh companies

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,399
this is the level of money that they're

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,280
looking to get out of it

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,839
now the problem is and the reason i put

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
there's a

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,960
miracle is this is actually pretty hard

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,159
to do i've been doing it for a few years

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,879
and making money on open source is hard

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,079
so people just don't want to pay for it

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,960
and there's a variety of

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,720
reasons but and you know because

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,240
basically people won't pay for things

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,839
that are free

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,240
or they won't pay very much for things

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,760
that are free and a simple example is

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,399
somebody in a big company

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,159
loves your stuff wants to use it in

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,599
order for them to pay you

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,599
they might have to go through three or

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
four years of three or four

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,240
months of arguing with their manager and

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
then fighting their way through

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,359
procurement

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,440
to get you a check most people are just

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,160
not going to do that so you have to

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,680
you have to give businesses some reason

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,320
or users some reason why they're going

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
to buy

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
why they're going to pay your money if

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
you get investment from a venture

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,359
capitalist it doesn't change that at all

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,280
it gives you more money to build the

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,640
business but it doesn't solve this basic

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
problem

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,839
and another thing that comes up is that

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,040
if you take

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,440
money or you sell the company

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,800
for example as we did to vmware a few

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,040
years ago

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
you're giving up control and the more

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
money you take or

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,359
or the more control you're going to give

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
up there can be other people who are

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,760
going to

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,440
going to be telling you how to run the

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
business and some of those people are

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,040
going to have pretty strong

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
opinions because if they're venture

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,079
capitalists they're looking to get a lot

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,680
of money back

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:55,839
so so these are this is just the reality

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,359
and what this does is it means that you

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,760
have to think about the future

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,040
if you want to avoid ethical dilemmas

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,480
about this

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,440
um so and i think that there's a couple

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,920
things that

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,200
that to think about if you're thinking

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
about commercial particularly if you're

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,520
thinking about commercializing your

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,480
project

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,599
i think one really basic one that people

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,880
kind of overlook is

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,040
you should think up front about how to

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,040
make money off it there's really only

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,839
about three ways to make money off open

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,560
source

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,200
you can offer services around it you can

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,200
build

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,119
a what's called commercial open source

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,400
where you have a free version which is

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,000
fully open source

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,520
and then you have another version which

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
is commercially licensed that has extra

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,800
goodies like

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,760
security for example or it's faster or

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,040
something

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,200
and then finally you can run it as a

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,560
cloud service so these are three

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,079
pretty standard models there are others

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,359
besides these but they are

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,359
they are the main ones and if you don't

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,000
do one of those and don't have a clear

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,599
path

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
you're probably going to have difficulty

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,119
you're probably going to end up

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,800
running into quandaries particularly if

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,640
you take money from somebody

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
so i think thinking about this up front

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,280
is it is a good idea

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,960
another thing is if you don't want to

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,560
have this arise at all

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
give your project to the community right

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,240
at the start so if you have a popular

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
project

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,760
a good thing to do there's foundations

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
for example like linux foundation or

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,640
apache

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,800
you can put your project into a

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,200
foundation or you can do the

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,280
same thing by effectively just having a

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,160
lot of contributors to the project

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,040
so that if it if it gets you know if you

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,040
sell it or

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,359
or you know something happens to you

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,320
there's somebody else to maintain it

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,960
so community-based projects don't have

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,320
this

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,520
rarely get have this re-licensing

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,960
you know sort of need because the

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
if they're community-based they don't

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,280
really need to make money they just are

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,160
sustained by the community as a whole

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,560
so those are some things to think about

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
and

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,800
um the final question is

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,839
uh that i see coming up a lot and that

00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,680
i've actually had to

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,119
to deal with myself is it okay to bail

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,160
on an open source project

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,079
um maybe you have a project that you've

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,440
um that you've maintained for a while

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,480
it's got a lot of users it's really

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,839
popular but

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
something in your life has changed

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,320
you're no longer interested in it

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,599
you don't have the ability to continue

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,240
doing it for

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,040
for economic reasons can you bail on it

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,599
and

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,400
the answer is absolutely there's nothing

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,359
in the contract and i think nothing that

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,440
says that you have to continue to be a

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,000
member of a community

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
beyond the point where it's no longer

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,359
something that you want to do

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,880
we're not trying to force people and

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,320
nobody i think wants to

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,000
you don't want to force anybody to have

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,079
to do anything

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,480
particularly when their contribution was

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,640
originally completely voluntary

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
so i do think there's a couple of things

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,000
to think about

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,160
one is just to be honest about it and i

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,359
think that on hacker news

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,119
and it's pretty common to see

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,800
that the standard way to deal with this

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
people on popular projects they write a

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,440
blog article they say hey this is the

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,839
history of the project

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,359
for reasons x y and z we need to change

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,920
i can't continue maintaining this our

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,000
company is no longer in business

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,280
we're going to have to stop maintaining

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,280
the project

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,040
and then the second thing if you can is

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,079
offer ownership to other people in the

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,240
community

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,920
this is something that we went through

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,800
at my current company

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,560
the um the click house plug-in to uh

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
that enables grafana was actually

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,480
originally developed by somebody

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,160
a guy named roman who went off to work

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,160
at cloudflare at some point

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,280
and that was a full-time job he didn't

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,560
have time to

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,400
um to uh to maintain the project but

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,599
what he did do was he contacted us and

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
said hey i know you're interested in

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,240
this

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,560
would you like to maintain it and then

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,839
he went out of his way to help us he

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,640
gave us administrative rights on the

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,560
project

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,400
and helped us become the maintainers

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,240
which which we now do

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
and of course if we couldn't do it we

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,280
would similarly pass it on to somebody

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,880
else

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,480
so i think that's that offering the

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,280
ownership is is really important

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,440
and that leads me i'm basically at the

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,640
end of this talk but i think if you

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,240
if you kind of go back and walk through

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,560
the thread of

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:17,119
of the of sort of open source ethics and

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,839
some of the answers that i've come up

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,760
with from my use in these problems

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,560
i think that there's some just some very

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,480
basic heuristics if you will

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,359
that you can use to meet your

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,839
obligations without having to be a saint

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,280
so just as an ordinary person if if you

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,119
follow these rules

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,520
you tend to get go in the right

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,400
direction you don't always do it but

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,160
um but but you'll tend to make the right

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,200
decisions that are good for your open

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,800
source community

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,119
the first is be honest and i think this

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,400
this sounds kind of sometimes this is

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,720
hard to do

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,480
i just because you have you know like if

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,920
you feel guilt for example but i think

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,119
one of the great things about open

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,520
source projects

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,359
is they're open the state of things is

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,359
clear you can just say it how it is you

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,520
know say it like it is

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,880
another one is follow the golden rule

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,000
treat others as you would have them

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,599
treat you

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,440
and this will always lead you in the

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,359
right direction

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,359
another one is to respect people's

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,960
contributions to the community and

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,800
just to remember that everyone who

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,520
belongs to the community contributes in

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
some way

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,280
it may be small it may be very large but

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,079
they're all contributing and you need to

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,040
remember that

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,400
and and value it and then finally be

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
realistic about the future

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,680
there's just some some obvious things

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,200
that happen you

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,680
you can't continue maintaining your

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,400
project you take vc money or

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,319
or other investment you may have

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,480
business considerations that

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,599
force you to do things to to avoid

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,400
laying people off for

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,440
example or you sell you have a company

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,520
and you sell it

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
all of these will change the way that

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,200
your project is

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,720
is is running and may have impacts on

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,960
your community so just think about them

00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,160
in advance

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,319
so those are my answers i hope that this

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,040
this the way that i've laid out the

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,800
problem of of ethics and

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,560
and some of these answers are helpful to

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,760
you if you have comments i'd love to

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,680
hear about them

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,040
this is something i'm trying to sort

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,319
through myself i

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,000
i think we have a few minutes for

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:21,160
questions you can also write

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,839
send me email directly at r hodges at

00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,440
altenew.com and i'd be delighted to

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,960
discuss this further so

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,400
thank you very much once again it's a

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,599
pleasure to be here and i hope you

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,839
enjoyed the talk

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,839
thank you

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,560
thank you very much and um i'll just

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,119
wait to see if anyone has any questions

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,800
or

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,599
oh yeah oh it's not a question

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,560
i guess you satisfied everyone's um

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,560
thoughts and

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,240
whatever they needed well well somebody

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,359
liked it that that makes it okay

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,200
the whole talk was worth it

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,480
so but it definitely you know if you

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,880
have this stuff

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,240
is like nobody has the answers to this

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,880
stuff and you mostly

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,079
most of these rules come through messing

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,839
stuff up

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,119
and then thinking through okay i could

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,400
have done that better

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,760
so yeah so if you have other problems

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
that you've run into i'd

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,400
i'd love to hear about them and and also

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
your answers to some of these problems

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,839
oh yeah you just got something in your

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,160
do you have um do you have examples of

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,240
communities that have engaged well or

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,839
not well with the open source community

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,280
community engagement tends to make or

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,720
break projects you have concrete

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,240
examples of companies that either

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,960
followed or disregarded the principles

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,960
you've described

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,680
yeah thank you for that question um i as

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,000
i said i think my sequel under my sequel

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,520
ab did a really great job of this

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,040
as a commercial prod uh uh project

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,680
um so i i think that

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,520
um and and what i liked about my sequel

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,280
because i love that community

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,040
it has changed since they were bought by

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,400
oracle obviously so that's that's kind

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,400
of out of scope

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,680
but um but what they did was they had

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,240
a bias toward accepting change

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,920
and i think that was that's a kind of a

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,720
code level way of being

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,720
of being welcome it's somebody said hey

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,680
you know i've got an idea for how my sql

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,160
can be improved

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,400
can you put it in and and so as a result

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,760
my sequel tended to add all these fixes

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,440
for stuff that were

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,440
problems that people had and sometimes

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,359
the fixes were a little half-baked

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
uh sometimes the you know the problems

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,079
weren't fully thought through so

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,560
on the one side they you know sometimes

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,160
it

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,760
you know it actually you know created

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,960
issues in my sequel but i think the

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,160
benefit was

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,640
it added features that that people

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,400
needed

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,480
it made them feel that they were valued

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,400
and i think that it was

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,800
you know sort of made it a community

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,760
that people wanted to belong to

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,119
and um i i think they so i think they

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,119
did a great job

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,839
i also think that overall um

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,520
uh yeah so other companies that have

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
done this well i think red hat is a

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,240
great example

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,160
that's actually a company i really look

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,960
up to i think um

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,000
that they because they found a bit and

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,960
here's why i like them

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,319
um because they found a business model

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,119
that allowed them

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,880
to be you know sort of have a consistent

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,319
view overall i mean

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,520
specific projects may vary but they had

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,800
a view that allowed them to be

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,880
consistent

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,800
in their uh in the way that they treated

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
the open source communities and the way

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,800
that they supported them so for example

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,920
they a tremendous amount of the linux

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,000
development

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,520
in the end is done by red hat

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,800
contributors or has been done over the

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,280
years so that's another company that's

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,000
done really well

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,400
and a company i'm working with right now

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,720
that i think is i'll actually i want to

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,319
call them out preset they're the folks

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,079
that support superset and i think

00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,520
they're just one of many

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,359
current companies that are just up and

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
coming that have done a really great job

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,800
of

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,079
of being welcoming to people um i've

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,760
i'm currently working with their

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,200
community and and we actually do most of

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
our business integration

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,040
through the community they're just great

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,680
to work with so i definitely recommend

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,240
