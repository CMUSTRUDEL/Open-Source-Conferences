Talk Title: The Role of Catastrophic Failure in Software Design 

Abstract:
Everyone knows success is boring! Anyone can succeed, and they won’t shut up about it after they do — as the famous saying goes, happy families are all alike. Let Jeff take you on a grand tour of what really matters in software development: failure. Take a glorious, life-affirming journey with me through the various ways I have failed at building major software projects, from Stack Overflow to Discourse. You too, can fail spectacularly, and look good doing it.
