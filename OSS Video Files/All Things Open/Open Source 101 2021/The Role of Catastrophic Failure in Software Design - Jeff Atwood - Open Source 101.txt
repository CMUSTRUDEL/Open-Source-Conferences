Jeff Atwood, a Software Developer/Author at Coding Horror, delivered a keynote talk at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021. 

Talk Title: The Role of Catastrophic Failure in Software Design 

Abstract:
Everyone knows success is boring! Anyone can succeed, and they won’t shut up about it after they do — as the famous saying goes, happy families are all alike. Let Jeff take you on a grand tour of what really matters in software development: failure. Take a glorious, life-affirming journey with me through the various ways I have failed at building major software projects, from Stack Overflow to Discourse. You too, can fail spectacularly, and look good doing it.

so thanks for having me

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,040
it's great to be here i was here in

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
person and 2017. it was a great event

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,920
really enjoyed it so thank you for the

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,680
opportunity again to speak

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199
um so

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
uh if you know about me you might know

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
about me through the venues that were

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,000
already discussed i

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
co-founder of stack overflow i've been a

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
long time blogger and my current project

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
is discourse which is that

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
icon in the middle and this talk is kind

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
of about

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,880
failing because i've always been a

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,480
little bit obsessed

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,360
with failure to the point that when i

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,280
launch projects i tell people

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
i don't know if this is going to work

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,559
this might not work i don't i don't know

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
what's going to happen

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,239
and that's always in in the back of my

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,640
mind and i can prove it because

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,559
if notice the date on this post this is

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
a post from a forum

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,920
still out there you can google it you

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
can find this this forum thread if you

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,079
want to

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,960
and you notice it's in 2008 and it's me

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,400
uh talking about how i'm basically going

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,200
to build stack overflow

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,280
and i mentioned i i don't know if it's

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
going to work

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
so you know i i like to build this way

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
and i want to talk a little bit about

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
why i like to build this way and why i

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
think it has so much power

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,159
um because normally you you talk about

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,520
success right so if you haven't seen

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,600
stack overflow

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,799
i'm sure you have this is stack overflow

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
i thought i'd show it to you in russian

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
just to make it a little more exciting

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,240
there are localized versions of stack

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,000
overflow out there

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
i think japanese and russian are the big

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
ones but there you have it

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,320
and really what i'm saying is that

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,000
success is boring there's a lot of talks

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,920
a lot of people that'll come on stage

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
and tell you you know oh look at all the

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
great things i've done look at all the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
great things that we've achieved and

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,079
i'm here to tell you that's boring

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
success is is boring it's it's not

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,840
interesting that's not the thing you

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
want to focus on um

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,880
and this famous tolstoy quote which

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
you'll see in so many different

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,920
presentations but i love it because

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,759
it's true uh it's saying the same thing

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
i'm saying which is success is just not

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,720
that interesting it's it's

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
yeah okay things are going great you're

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
very successful you're

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
you're you're everything's humming along

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,239
you're you're rich good good for you

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
great um but what about everybody else

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
you know what about other stuff

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
and a lot of success really is luck

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,319
that's the thing you know it's

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,840
it's not that i was so talented and i

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,200
made this happen it's like well

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
you happen to be in the right place the

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,239
right time you did a few things

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,760
and you know you you had a great outcome

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
that's great but you gotta acknowledge a

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,319
lot of this is luck a lot of this is

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,599
really just

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
being in the right place at the right

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
time so

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
will wright who's a famous software

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,519
developer he built some city he built

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
a lot of really really well-known games

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,200
uh an icon in the gaming industry says

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
one of his key hiring

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
questions is to ask someone not tell me

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
about all the great things you've done

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
but

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,959
tell me about the things you worked on

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,080
that failed

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,640
and here's a guy who has built

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,959
games you've definitely played the sims

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,560
some city spore i mean he's a he's a

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,080
world-renowned game developer um and

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,319
that's where learning comes from it

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,239
doesn't come from success learning comes

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
from failure learning comes from

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
the thousand times you tried and it

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
didn't work that's where you learn

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,000
you know it's it's hard to learn from

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
success it's it's it's

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
much more useful to learn from failure

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
so with this in mind

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,480
you might think about surgeons like

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
surgeons you don't want surgeons to fail

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
like failure is

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
bad if you're a surgeon because you know

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,640
it's literally life or death a lot of

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,680
our software isn't which is great but if

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
you're a surgeon

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
that's bad so uh there was a process

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,840
where they studied surgeons why

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
why are surgeons some surgeons uh

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,799
successful why are some surgeons not

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
successful

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
and this turned out to be the key

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
question if you wanted to find out if a

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
surgeon was going to be successful you

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,319
would say

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
have you ever made a mistake and if so

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,319
what was your worst mistake

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
and the ones who said oh i don't really

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,760
make mistakes

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
or i had a mistake but it wasn't my

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,519
fault

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,480
those were the bad surgeons those were

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
the surgeons that had low success rates

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,760
the surgeons who answered oh gosh i make

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
mistakes all the time you know and geez

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
this thing the other day that happened

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
to me i just

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
i totally screwed it up those were the

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
good surgeons

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
they were the they had the ability to

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
think about

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
what they had done and improve it based

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
on their failures

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
that's that's the key to being a great

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
surgeon ironically

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
and if you haven't seen this this graph

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,400
this picture

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,560
i hope you have i love this picture

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
because what it illustrates is world war

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,080
ii bombers

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,520
that came back they analyzed damage in

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
world war ii of the bombers that came

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
back

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
to learn how to make better airplanes

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
you know where should we reinforce the

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
airplane where should we add

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
armor and if you look at this grav you

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
think oh gee

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,080
look at all the damage we want to add

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
armor where all the damage is

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,759
see that's the problem you're looking

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
at success data you're looking at

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
bombers that made it back

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
the bombers that made it back are fine

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,160
they don't need

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840
armor in those areas they need armor in

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,520
the other areas

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
so success can you know

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,039
failure is interesting in a way that

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
success is not right you didn't get to

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,919
see

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,680
the crashed planes all you got to see

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,039
was the ones who made it back

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
what you really wanted to see was the

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
ones that didn't make it back but you

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
don't get to

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,880
right so that's why you have to really

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
seek out the failure and people hide it

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
it's like well i failed but i don't talk

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
about it because

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,240
you know that makes me feel bad like i

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,919
fail that's terrible and i'm saying no

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
you want to be obsessed with failure you

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,840
want to be like yes i failed

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
good um but in a very particular way so

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,680
let me talk about the three ways

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,600
so first in the industry as a whole so

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
in the software industry how do you get

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
the benefit of failing without

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,680
trying to fail you know nobody sets out

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,160
to fail that's a ridiculous goal to have

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
uh we do this thing called a post-mortem

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
it's a little bit morbid but it

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,400
literally means you know after death

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
and it documents how we all make the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,319
same mistakes over and over

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
we we constantly do this right like that

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
that's

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,199
that's a problem and the book bad blood

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,919
is a great example of this

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,520
theranos fantastic story there's an hbo

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,560
series not quite as good as the book in

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,120
my opinion so

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
definitely check out the book it will

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,360
blow you away like the things that

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,919
happened at

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
their notes are insane but it's a good

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
example of failure

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
uh very high profile failure there's

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
also a book collection

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,440
of and i like video games because video

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
games to me are really hard

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
because you're trying to optimize for

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
fun you're using really advanced

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
tech you gotta you know be on the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
cutting edge

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
and it's really really difficult kind of

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,039
software development in my opinion

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
that's one of the hardest kinds

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,120
um and there's a lot of different games

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,199
that you can look at post-mortems

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
of teams that were trying to build these

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
games and some of them worked some of

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,840
them didn't some of these are famous

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,680
you may recognize and it's what i call

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
the gilligan's island phenomenon where

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,479
this is an old show

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,400
i'm getting so old now that my

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,080
references have to be explained

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,319
this is a show that i would watch as a

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,800
kid and it's castaways they're stuck

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,840
on this island and every week they try

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
to get off the island

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,120
they have some crazy scheme to get off

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
the island but they always fail

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
hence the show they're stuck on this

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
island forever

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
um and so here's you know they're

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
thinking like how do we get off this

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
island how do we

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
escape this this plight that we're in

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
and

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,560
they're always stuck right but they keep

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
trying you know they keep trying every

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
week they try a new thing

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,199
to get off the island that's the entire

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
premise of the show

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
and that's kind of how we look at

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
software development

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
and there's this sort of classic

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
mistakes that you make and one of them

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
is in this book the mythical man month

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
this is one one of the mistakes you make

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
in software development but it's a

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,759
really

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,000
common one it's adding people thinking

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,319
well my project is going slowly so

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,599
if i add a person that'll speed things

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,599
up and it's like

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
well actually no that will slow your

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,720
project down

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,479
that's a classic mistake this book is

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
one of the mistakes there's lots of

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,160
mistakes okay so

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,759
i'm not going to read this list but you

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,479
want to review the list of common

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
mistakes

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,280
in the industry and say am i making

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
these as a person who runs a project

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
every day you should be well not every

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,080
day but every week look at this list and

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
think am i am i doing this

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
am i falling into this common failure

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,839
pattern that lots

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,959
of other projects have failed with and

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,560
you should say look

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,360
i want to make mistakes but i want to

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,360
make really good mistakes like new ones

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,320
no one has ever failed in this way

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
before spectacular right like a new

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,279
failure

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
no one's ever seen before that should be

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,600
your goal

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,760
which brings me to the hvac chernobyl

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,680
one of the best things i've seen

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
in the last five years maybe one of the

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
best things i've seen in my entire life

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
i would actually rank the show like top

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
five all time

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,760
things i've ever seen it's a fantastic

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,279
thing and it's based on a real incident

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
it's mostly correct they take a few

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
liberties um

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,399
and chernobyl of course is is a is a big

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
nuclear accident and it's the first time

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,040
that happened

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,360
on earth it was literally the first time

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
uh and the funny thing well maybe funny

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,560
is not the right word

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
the strange thing about it is it

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,800
happened during a

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,480
safety check so a safety check actually

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,080
triggered chernobyl

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
uh which is kind of ironic and it truly

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,240
was unique to the planet

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,080
like this had never happened before and

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,839
that that's the kind of the way i want

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
you to think about failure like think

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
can we create a spectacular failure no

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
one has seen before

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
it sounds bad but that actually should

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
be your goal because you don't want to

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
fall into the common mistakes

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
so look at the past failures on your

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
team so number two

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,080
one is the industry think about industry

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
common failure patterns in the industry

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
now think about your own failures right

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,880
this is where you start looking at your

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
own team your own projects yourself

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
actually

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
um and the show does this it actually

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
starts in the past

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
right like it's like it it's in out of

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
order

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,519
so you want to go back and in discourse

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,959
which the software i currently

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,640
build we have a catego a tag called

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,360
postmortem you can see it at the upper

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
left there

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
this is looking all categories things

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,279
tagged postmortem

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
every time there's a big enough failure

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,000
event little tiny failures we don't

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
document but

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
a failure of significance we document

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
it's important

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
that's part of our routine is to

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
understand

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,320
our failures by writing them down

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
and we make a timeline we start with

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,920
well this is when it started

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,600
here's all the things that happened so

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
step one is to enumerate like what

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
happened

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,040
like you know and and you know one

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
critical metric here is how long did it

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
take you to even figure out what was

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,279
happening

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
like a bad thing was happening but what

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
how fast can you figure that out that

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,440
is a type of optimization that you want

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
to be really good at you want to be

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
really good at

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,959
seeing why things failed quickly like

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
diagnosing them

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,160
quickly and how can we fix it even

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,480
faster the next time

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
that's the the bigger picture goal right

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
like what are we going to change

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
as a result is failure so the next time

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
something like this happens

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,959
we can solve it even faster

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
and just writing things down honestly

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,920
what i showed you was just us

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,760
writing things down like well here's

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,959
what happened we there's some formatting

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
to it we just tell the story of what

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
happened

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
that's it that's all you got to do just

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
make sure you write it down

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,959
so think about failure write it down and

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
remember it's stressful

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
failures are like you know stuff is

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
going down

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,440
right like literally stuff is going down

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,560
it's frantic

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
but you gotta take notes you gotta have

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,680
someone

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
or someone on your team we call it the

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
scribe

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,079
taking notes and making sure they they

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
are documenting everything that's

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,360
happening because it's hard

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
and you might miss it you might have an

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
event and like everybody's running

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
around so friends

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,240
like no one wrote down the notes that we

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
needed to understand this event so bear

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
that in mind

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
and in the show they do a fantastic job

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
chernobyl

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,399
document figuring out what happened is

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
like the process of going through and

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,040
talking to so many people

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
writing it down and getting everyone's

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
perspective and at the end she plops

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
this huge pile this is a sort of a

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
character that's an uh

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
aggregation of a bunch of scientists

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,519
this character represents a bunch of

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
russian scientists who all did this work

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,200
she plops down

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,279
the set of journals like this is what i

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519
found this is what happened this is what

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
what what did uh and also bear in mind

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
like don't

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,000
make it worse because

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,880
it's stressful again and you as you're

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
running around

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
you might be yelling at people you might

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
be like how you know we're down this is

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
terrible our customers are you know it's

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,519
it's you know don't don't make it worse

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,560
there's a great character

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,440
in chernobyl who does this uh

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,440
the sort of the the boss at chernobyl

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
who's on duty at the time

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
makes things a lot worse because he's

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,720
like no this isn't happening this didn't

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
happen this can't happen

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
and they're like wait it did happen he

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,880
said nope didn't happen

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,880
don't believe you and he wasn't open to

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,160
it he was actually making things worse

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,200
uh it's kind of a parody meme now like

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,560
this is

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,120
a red radiation burn representation of

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
him saying ah three 3.6 wrench and it's

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,880
not great it's not terrible

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,000
uh but actually the device was pegged

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,079
like that was as high as it would go

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
that's what he wasn't thinking of so

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
hence the joke

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
kind of a you know a very russian dark

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
joke

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
but that's that's a russian joke for you

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
and you don't want to be the person

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,440
who's answering everything

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,240
like oh you know i got it i ask a lot of

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
questions like

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,240
what's happening who's on it why did

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
this happen why did this happen why you

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,959
know and

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
the five why's you want to be asking a

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
ton of questions

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,199
and that can be part of the stuff you

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
write down like well you know what

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,399
happened here

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,199
why where did we go here so

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
that's your failures so consider the

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
industry

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
common failure patterns look at your own

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,760
past failures you will have postmortems

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
right because you're writing things down

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,199
because you understand how to do

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
postmortems and you're practicing this

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,920
as a team

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,279
you all have those to look at now you

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,279
need to think about

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,480
how are we going to fail in the future

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
that we haven't failed yet

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
this is where this is the art right this

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,399
is where it gets tricky

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,079
um there's a great quote there's so many

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
beautiful quotes in chernobyl it's such

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,279
an amazing show

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
why worry about something that isn't

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,959
gonna happen

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,160
oh that's perfect they should put that

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,880
on our money

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
and god this scene is so powerful i

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,000
can't

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
do it justice but this is about

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,680
predicting the future

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,720
worrying about things that shouldn't

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,800
happen but might

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
um and then safety system checks and i

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
mentioned chernobyl was the result of a

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
safety system check the safety system

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
check

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
triggered the problem um but

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
that being said you still should be

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
doing regular safety system checks what

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
does that look like on your team

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
on your software in your process what

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
does a safety check look like it can

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,279
take a lot of different

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,880
forms one thing we do at discourse this

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,240
is our github we're an open source

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
project you could go there right now

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,800
discord slash discourse

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,720
every time someone checks in code we run

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,320
a series of smoke tests to make sure

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
that discourse is still functioning

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,480
still producing output in a browser

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:40,079
right um and you know unit tests

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
you know uh all kinds of tests run

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,199
to make sure the code is still

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,800
functioning as we expect it to

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
so there's a lot of stuff you can do

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,959
that that's automated like

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
automate the checks right all the free

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
automation

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
check you can do you absolutely should

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,519
be doing as

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
a best practice just in general and

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,519
that's standard industry practice

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,440
uh so here is uh the build test

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
right so every time you check in code to

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
discourse we actually

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
run all those tests on it oh and by the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,600
way every time you check code

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
into discourse you can do this right now

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
you can go to github literally edit a

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
text file

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,440
you will trigger all the tests you will

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
trigger the smoke test you will trigger

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
the

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,519
javascript headless browser check and

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
you will cause code to be deployed to

00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,680
meta.discourse.org

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,320
right now today so meta.discourse.org

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,600
is the site we use to support discourse

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,880
so when it's down

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,720
believe me we notice because

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,399
it's part of our daily routine we go

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
there that's how we support our own

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
software

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
and it's deployed every time there's a

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,120
check-in of any kind

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,639
uh so that's another way to think about

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,600
this

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
uh so here's some some logs so when

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,440
things

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,199
aren't going right we actually create

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
topics so this is

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,519
again trying to predict the future oh

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
geez our logging rate is really high

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
oh gosh puppet isn't running that might

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
be bad

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
so there's a lot of like what ifs you

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,039
can kind of automate

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,839
like things that haven't gone wrong yet

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,120
but might

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,959
let's run checks for that um so this is

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,640
this is what you're seeing is the alerts

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
category if you look at the upper right

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,799
it says alerts and it's in red

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
appropriate color for alerts and saying

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
here's all our current alerts these are

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,959
topics that are automatically generated

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,520
in discourse

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,080
based on uh monitoring what's happening

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,840
we also have an external check this is

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,000
pingdom we've switched

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,200
have switched to status cake now but

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
it's all kind of the same thing it's

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,679
like from the outside world

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
are your websites still actually there

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,640
and

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
define what actually there means is it

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,880
does it return html

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,640
great uh does it actually does it have

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,880
javascript errors on the page

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,240
are there visual rendering errors i mean

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
it could be a style sheet error that

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,640
makes the whole site unusable right

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,080
it's technically functioning but all the

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
text could be upside down

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
right for all you know so again you got

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,440
to decide what what functioning actually

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
means

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,840
and what you should be checking for so

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,400
this is just sort of rudimentary

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
html checks a very low level but an

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
important

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
level and you've got to have a lot of

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,080
these levels to check there's this great

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
movie charlie victor romeo it was a play

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,640
originally and it is intense

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,880
um what it is is it's a replay of black

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
boxes so these are boxes on an airplane

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
that record everything that happens

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
and they're super hardened so if the

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,039
plane doesn't make it

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,919
the black box does and the black box

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,760
records

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
everything that's happening on the plane

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,480
all the instrumentation

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,320
all the voice chatter all the control

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,720
head settings and headings

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,440
and these are actors replaying

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
what was on the voice recorders and most

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,480
of these planes didn't make it

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,799
but it's really instructive to think

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,720
about the instrumentation you need

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,320
to have to understand like well why did

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,000
this happen so we can fix it

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
so this doesn't happen again even if it

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,120
was human error right and you're going

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
to hear

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
them working through the problem you're

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,520
going to hear them trying to figure out

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
what's happening

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,039
in real time and it is a tough watch but

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,760
important because aviation is incredibly

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,000
safe like statistically the risk of

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,280
someone dying from an airplane crash is

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,039
unbelievably low like like driving your

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
car is so much more risky than flying in

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,000
a plane like

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,320
i think orders of magnitude and this is

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,640
why because they take this stuff so

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
seriously and they're monitoring

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,440
everything that's happening

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
and analyzing it in the case of the

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,919
failures so

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
in discourse we also do sort of black

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,679
box instrumentation which and this

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
ships with every version of discourse if

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,559
you go to you look at the

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,320
url there it's dev.discourse.org logs

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,480
if you installed this course you get

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,240
slash logs it's our custom ui

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,679
that says hey here's all the errors

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
we've encountered in discourse there's

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
various levels there's warning there's

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,679
fatal

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,000
and it's a really great tool and we

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,799
contributed it back to the community

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
it's called logster and a lot of the

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,159
logging is paid logging

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
in ruby world unfortunately but this is

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
free we didn't like that we're like no

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
this needs to be free this kind of black

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
box

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,600
instrumentation must be available

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
available to everyone because it is so

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,480
critical

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
so as a site owner you have access to

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,919
your own kind of black box

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,080
like well geez what went wrong on my

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
site on the server side and also on the

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,840
client side

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,640
um so logic is a great tool so you got

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
to think about

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
what am i monitoring which you know

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,520
again if you're monitoring your logging

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,960
you're generating graphs

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,799
and some of the graphs can be really

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,200
instructive you know like just to look

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,120
at them and say well geez the trend here

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
nothing bad is happening now but the

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,760
trend is bad

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,159
right like if we continue at this rate

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
i mean you know terrible things are

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
going to happen

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
this is the number of cued jobs you're

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
seeing

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,799
we really don't want this many jobs in

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,240
the queue because that means the cue's

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,919
not being cleared

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
and that way we can fix it before it

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,080
becomes a problem that's the magic right

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,320
we know we saw the trend intervened

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,840
and did not have a problem as a result

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,400
that's the goal

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,799
so that is what we're sort of getting to

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
here and that's what chernobyl was about

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,480
is like

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,880
how do we fix this not just for us but

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,600
for

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,600
everyone so this never happens to us

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,679
again

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,280
that's what they ultimately got to and

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,200
chernobyl the final moments are

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
so fascinating i don't want to ruin it

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,159
for you but

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,480
the whole story is about figuring out

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,200
what happened and the engineering that

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,480
goes into figuring out what happened

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,000
that's the the goal to make it so this

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,799
doesn't happen for anyone

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
ever again not just our team but as an

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,760
as an industry

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,200
you know for for all software developers

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,440
for anyone building

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
software how can we make things better

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,000
and the type

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,039
of reactor chernobyl is has flaws

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,039
it's a flawed design and they went back

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,080
and fixed those flaws finally

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,919
after much much prodding

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,600
a lot of prodding watch chernobyl and

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,720
you'll see how intense it gets

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,159
very russian there are still some

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,880
operational reactors that are

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
the same style as chernobyl that have

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
some of the same risks

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
that they've kind of mitigated but it's

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,799
still there and so that's what i want

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,039
you to think about is

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,400
you know at the industry level where do

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
we typically fail

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
how to how to do post-mortems on your

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
own team and look at your own failures

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
and say well geez you know how can we do

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,760
better

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
and then also think about predicting the

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,000
future i know it's hard

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,039
but like how can we plan to fail

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and avoid those situations that cause us

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,880
to fail

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,280
and how do we get better as an industry

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
like

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
that to me is the most noble goal we

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
have

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,240
is to build better for for ourselves

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
and for everyone and even the current

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
pandemic

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,520
we're going to be better at the next one

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,679
right we have amazing vaccines

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
based on a very novel type of vaccine

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
generation

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,799
viruses aren't going away and we'll get

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,000
better at this this failure

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,919
will make us better and that's the goal

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,240
thank you very much i hope this talk was

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,240
useful to you and i think i'll do some q

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:36,400
a now i don't know if there's time

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:36,400
