Description: 
	Wisdom Nwokocha, Mobile/Documentation Engineer at Savics, delivered the talk "Building a Technical Documentation Static Site for Open Source Projects" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Documentation is the product of technical writing that refers to different documents with product-related data and information; it has the details about a technical product that is either under development or already in use.

During this presentation, Wisdom will be talking about the tools that are used to build a static open source documentation site and host them on github pages/ Netlify.

Expect to come out of the session with:
an overview on tools such as 11ty, Docsify, docusaurus, MkDocs.
build and host a static website using 11ty framework on Netlify

	00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
all right thank you

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,599
uh matteo and then welcome everyone to

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,920
today's um session

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
so um today we'll be talking about

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,880
building a technical documentation

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
static site for open source projects

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,680
particularly using

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,480
11t although we have so many other tools

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,359
that could do that but i just love

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,760
elements so much because of the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,800
use the way it makes things quite easy

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,040
and how you

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
kind of have a more easy way to

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
customize it

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,520
so let me share my screen and so we can

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
set up from there

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,840
okay so i don't have access to share my

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
screen

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
hello so i don't have access to share my

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,199
screen

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:13,840
i guess let me take a look at the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:13,840
participant best story

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:27,840
uh are you able to share it now let me

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,840
see all right yeah

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,280
okay sorry

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
okay so um first first of all i would

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
like us to

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,479
talk about documentation so

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,079
documentation is an important aspect of

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
software development and

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
not just software development hazard

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
aspect of

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,439
tech also design aspect and

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,479
almost every code base definitely needs

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
documentation

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,079
but for internal use and sort of

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
external use

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
and um how big and how small require how

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
big and how small your company is

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
requires some form of

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
documentation so it ranges from the

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,520
simple readme you have on your

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,959
github google app or it tries

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,360
right tries bitbucket repo

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,200
down to your contribution guidelines and

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
in some projects it

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
becomes a necessity to use a nice and

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
scalable system for

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,560
generating and maintaining and also

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,519
deploying the

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,599
documentation so let's say you want to

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
just to work with your readme it's going

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,959
to be very difficult because you just

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
have a very long list of

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
everything there and everybody starts

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
scrolling down before you want to

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
go up so it's going to be so tiring so

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,080
that is where a static site

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,280
documentation generator comes in

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
so they are easy to use they're

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,200
versatile and extremely user friendly

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
and they're very very fast

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
also and they are mostly used to

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
document apis

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,720
database schemas and other information

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,280
by organizations

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
sorry

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
all right so what is the static side

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,720
term

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
generators

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
sorry all right so a static site

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,239
generator is a tool that

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,599
generates the full full static html

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,400
website based on

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,239
raw data and a set of templates so as we

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,159
go further you get to

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,760
see the templates that most of the

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,480
satisfied generators still work with

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,760
and also a static site generator

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
automates the tax of

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
coding individual html pages and gets

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,840
those pages

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,840
ready to serve users ahead of time

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
okay so one of them we are going to talk

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,280
about today is

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,799
one eleventy second one is doxify

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,680
and cassarious and mkdox

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,239
so let's start with mk dog so mk docks

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
is the first

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,479
it's a fast simple and downright

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,880
gorgeous statistic generator that's

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
generates towards building project

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,199
documentations

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
so most of the documentation source

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
files everything is knocked down and

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
configured is a single

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,440
mfi configuration file so

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,160
one of the features is has a fantastic

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,280
looking graphical

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,320
cons type content and bonus and

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,040
you also have social media footage also

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
github action integration and easy to

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
setup

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,720
support smartdown or governed by single

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,720
file

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
so let's do docsify is the documentation

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,919
statistic

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,080
without the static html5 docs files

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
documentation website on the fly without

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
generating static

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,520
instant files so the features are known

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,560
statically with html5s

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,440
simple and lightweight smartphone

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
text search plugin multiple things

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
useful

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,560
plugin api compatible with internet

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,039
exploring level

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,160
support ssr and support template nice

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,360
so the casourius is a project for

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
building easily

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
building deploying and maintaining open

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
source

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
project websites and optimize site

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,680
generator and react

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,960
so the features are powered by markdown

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,080
due to using react ready for translation

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,520
document versioning documents and quit

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,479
quick etc so for eleventh is

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,880
simple simply as static side generator

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,479
and

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
alternative to junkies written in

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,120
javascript so it transforms

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
transforms your directory of templates

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
of

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,039
varying types into html so it works with

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,440
several templates html magazine liquid

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,880
non-jokes handlebars

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,160
and mustache and so much more

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,960
and the features uh one

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
easy to set up support multiple template

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
language like i said

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,520
both and one feature which i like so

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,240
much about it is one it is customizable

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
so you can customize it as much as you

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,479
want

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,919
so okay the next step here is for us to

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,880
to build a basic element inside

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,800
so first thing you have to do is create

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,759
a package.json file which

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
you use by adding your code here npm in

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
it

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
then the next thing is to install

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,600
element into the package

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,400
this one by using this code npm install

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
110 and after that you have to want to

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,880
move it

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,080
in order then the fourth step would be

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,199
to

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,759
create your some templates then

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,960
you have to run it locally to test it

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,560
it's working fine

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,000
or not so for this section

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,479
i would head over to my code base so

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
we just have to create a very simple

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,960
elementy

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,199
website static website then try to

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
run it locally and see how it runs then

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,599
also

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,039
post it on like five to try to see if

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,800
you could get it up for everyone to use

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,479
so the next step is um first thing

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,880
first i would okay okay sorry so let me

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,880
let me share my screen so

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
new okay

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,919
all right so i would create

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,560
i'll create a new new repo i'll call it

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
okay

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,840
okay so okay let me share again

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,599
i had to head over to my vs code

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,599
so i will locate

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,479
your required clicker which is ht open

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,479
source 101

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,719
okay so the first step the first time i

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,719
started the move was to

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,839
so the first step is to appear in it

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,839
so empty i am in it and what it does is

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,839
creates the packet.json

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
files

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
so our next step what we have to do here

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,839
is to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
mdm install the 11t file

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:51,839
okay so they just wait a few minutes for

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,839
it to install

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,600
so after installs the next step is for

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
us to run our 110 so we use the mpx to

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
run our local project

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,640
version version of the 110 just to make

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
sure our installation went

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
okay

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,480
so if you look over here

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,640
if you look over here you will see that

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
the version is stored about 110 for us

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
now

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
so the next step for us is to try to run

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,800
this and see if everything went okay and

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,519
everything is fine from what we are

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,519
seeing so far

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
then we have to create something

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,839
okay so the next step to

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
go is now to run okay so just

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:29,839
okay so it has given us a local

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,839
server to test it

okay so i'm having some technical issues

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,440
so just give me a few minutes let me

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,440
go through it and however the problem is

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,839

we have the problem solved i feel feel

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
free

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
everyone please stand by we're having

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,199
some technical

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,160
difficulties as can often happen in live

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:51,839
events

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:51,839
we'll be back with you as soon as we can

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
you

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
you

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,559
everyone please say by the speakers

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:25,840
having a technical issue we'll be

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:25,840
back with you as soon as we can

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,919
you

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,679
okay so i still having some issues so

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,600
probably what i have to do i would

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,440
probably go through a

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,280
few examples i've already done the past

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,280
time get up from there

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,840
but it's taking so much time

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,360
okay so i would i will start with a

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
different

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,880
example i've i've done in the past so

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,840
let me just

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,840
bring it out

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
so

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,440
all right can hear me now okay so

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
this is um and the different example

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,280
i've

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,799
done in the past so this is the

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,039
way it would look like the structure of

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,280
your folders will look like

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,799
you have this site folder which is the

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,520
folder that will be created when you run

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,080
your

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,520
your advantage you'll event it yourself

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
so the serve means that you should

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,280
create

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,120
and convert every data into a static

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
html and put it down into this folder

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,679
serve and this folder is folder that

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
will be served

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
it's folder that would convert that

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
would have everything into html so if

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,520
you can see my screen clearly

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,679
you will see that we have this

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,400
academic close itself coming down here

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,520
we have this about the ngk

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,720
the index.njk and we have this

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,840
elementary.js which is the configuration

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,640
file

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
so when you run when you run your

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,200
element yourself

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,520
so it will convert everything from about

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
and this converts everything to html and

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
goes there about

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,640
and convert it to html too so this is

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,000
how um

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,840
elementor works so converting this

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,600
because this this runs um locally

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,919
it doesn't run on the server at the

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,640
moment so you can now run this on local

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,640
excel to run

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,840
so go back to okay let me share

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,000
so this is just a simple simple

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,320
static website recruited with an element

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
so i have the side double side and have

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
the

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,640
center part of it so you can navigate to

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,840
your about and updates to your contact

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,880
you see how fast it goes

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:28,159
so now moving this to nitrify

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,919
the first step we have to do is to

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
push this to any content storage are

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,400
working with

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,919
distract and bitbucket bitlab or

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,360
github so in this case

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:47,840
we are moving this to github so let's

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,840
push it to github

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,840
what's up

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,840
okay so head over to my github account

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,200
okay then first of all let's go over to

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,520
neglify

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,960
so on netflix platform you just if you

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,600
don't have an account notified you

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
register with next file then only five

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,720
platform

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,279
you can now start a new site from git

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,600
so having it inside from bits now the

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,760
first step is for you to connect your

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,360
bits with your book provider github

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,320
bitlab or bitbucket

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,000
then after connecting that you pick a

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,200
repository then you

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
set the settings then deploy so it's how

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,080
fast and how

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,440
easy to do that from from netflix

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,960
so this is an example when i did

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
guys on my github account

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
so when you click on this it gets to

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
open up the

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:10,400
gets to open up simple

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,440
relevant to static website actuators

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,640
so for the technical

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,600
shoes i'll fix that later so that is how

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
easy and how

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,039
simple to set up your elementary and

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,240
then

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,120
for more details i would share the links

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,919
of

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,840
your study site generator i still had a

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
book so you can go and check them out

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,120
and

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
have more feel of what they do and see

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,320
their

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,480
magic powers so that's it for me thank

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
you

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,840
so you can drop your questions and i

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,840
will take the questions

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,399
okay so um i have a question here why

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
did you choose

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,120
eleventh as the demo how do some of the

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
other tools you mentioned compared to

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,000
each other

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,919
well like i said earlier i i like the

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
other tools definitely there are so many

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,559
tools

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,720
so so many tools but i just prefer

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,120
i prefer le vente because of the easy

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,360
customization and it's it's very

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,240
it's very nice for you to customize and

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,120
easy

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,000
most of the tools are they're more like

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
rigid

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,600
okay let me let me share a link of

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,679
i will share the link of docsify and i

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,799
also share the link of

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,840
because serious and mk docs so you get

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,200
to see

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,880
they have so many templates but you must

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
pick from their templates you cannot

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,520
pick outside the templates

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,640
or you get to create one template from

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,520
yourself it is

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,320
quite not too to me i don't find it

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,399
quite

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,600
easy but compared to element element

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,760
gives you that room for

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
easy customization you create your site

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,600
the way you want and how

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,440
the look and feel of the sides it's very

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,080
easy so that's why i picked the element

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,520
over

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,399
the tools but i also like the other two

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
so

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,600
i could choose them anytime i like but i

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,760
just like it lavender because of

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,039
it's it's light to it also and it's easy

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,039
to customize

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,159
okay i have one which i added

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,279
which i showed and i'm currently working

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,960
with a company called nylas and

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,640
moving their their dogs so

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
that's a very very big company so and

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,799
they're using the levante for that

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,399
and it's been fun for me building and

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,240
moving their projects from

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,399
they say they're working with me moving

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,960
it from with me down to

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,720
to eleven so that is one big project i

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,120
know the other side is quite small

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
projects

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,159
if you work on more than one project

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,080
that has different dog systems

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,440
does it take a long time to shift your

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,880
thinking into the new

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,919
system uh to work on modern one

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,919
well it it it doesn't it doesn't it

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,240
depends on it depends on the person

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,760
it depends on your particular person and

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
how you see things

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,360
for me i don't think it will take me so

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
much time to

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,600
to shift my thinking into a new english

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,600
system as long as i see

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,640
something quite interesting is around i

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
will definitely

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
achieve terms

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,960
so i've dropped the link in

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,679
chat docsify i've also dropped

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:41,679
the lucas series

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,679
i've also dropped eleventy

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,840
let me get a

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:05,840
so let me get the mk box and also drop

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,840
it so you go and check

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,159
thank you do you have any other

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
questions

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,200
so i've dropped all the links so you can

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
go through and check

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,000
then you might do the comparing contrast

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
but for me i would advise anyone that

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,440
works

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,880
best for you you can you can pick anyone

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,279
that will make things might

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
quite easy and faster for you and also

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,240
much better for

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,000
for the audience too it's not like i

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
