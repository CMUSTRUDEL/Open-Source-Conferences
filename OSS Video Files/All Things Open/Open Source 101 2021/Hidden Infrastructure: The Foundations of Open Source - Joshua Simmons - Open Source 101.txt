Joshua Simmons, President of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and Ecosystem Strategy Lead at Tidelift, delivered a keynote talk at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Talk Title: Hidden Infrastructure: The Foundations of Open Source

Abstract:
Modern software development wouldn’t be possible but for the work of countless nonprofits, yet we the benefactors of their work largely labor in blissful ignorance of this hidden infrastructure. I did too, for 15 years.

Linux, Git, Python, Drupal, Homebrew, Eclipse, Apache Web Server, and Kubernetes–these are just a few of the ubiquitous projects that rely on nonprofits. Even open-source licensing itself relies on a nonprofit!

In this talk, we’ll survey the nonprofit ecosystem that undergirds our industry. We’ll answer questions, including:

Who are these nonprofits?
What do they do?
Why does it matter?
We’ll explore why the future of open source, and our livelihoods, rests on the continued existence of these nonprofits. And lastly, we’ll answer the question: what is our role, as creators and consumers of open source software, in light of all this?”

so today i'm here to talk to you about

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
as todd mentioned

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,439
the foundations of open source it's a

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
little bit of a play on words it's not

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
great but

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,280
uh here's the thing

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
i came to open source really late in my

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
career

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,000
i started as a web developer when i was

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
still in school

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
i was trying to work my way through

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
school

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
realized that i couldn't afford it

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,079
couldn't get all the loans wasn't

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
earning enough income

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
but i had a career i had a trade skill

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
on my hand so i decided okay i'll

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,399
drop out of college i'll try this web

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
development thing for a bit

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
well my web development career blew up

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,840
and i was using a lot of drupal

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,439
a lot of wordpress uh you know bootstrap

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,399
and jquery entered the scene somewhere

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,840
midway through my

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
early web development career there

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
and it was interesting i never really

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,080
thought much

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
about it i never thought that anything

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
novel

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,520
was really going on um

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
to me as somebody who grew up in with

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
like

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
the advent of the internet uh or rather

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,760
the advent of the world wide web

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,080
uh with peer-to-peer file sharing

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
to me open source just felt like a

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
natural extension

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
of that culture that i was already used

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
to

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,599
it didn't occur to me that there was

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,720
anything really special going on

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,560
and as a web developer i'm not alone in

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,640
that i'm not alone in that experience

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,519
web developers are arguably the single

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
largest block

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
of uh of developers of open source

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
developers

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,280
on the planet and yet and yet it's very

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,160
very easy

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
to go through one's career without

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,400
realizing that anything special is going

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
on

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,840
without realizing why it is i can

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
sell a drupal or sell a wordpress

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,440
so part of my career was being a

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,360
community manager

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,239
community organizer and i

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
in about 2013 i had the great fortune to

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
be

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
uh hired as o'reilly media's community

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,959
manager

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,080
for open source and for web technology

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,560
and it was it was like being

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
hit by a freight train like it was just

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
in a good way

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
really revelatory just how much there

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
was

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
behind this term open source that i had

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
never

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,720
bothered to interrogate over the first

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,000
decade of my career

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,879
and so i say this i say this to let you

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
know

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,080
that if you don't know a lot about some

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
of the things i'm going to tell you

00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:00,000
about today

00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:03,280
that's okay you're in good company

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,760
so today i'm just going to talk through

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
a few of the key questions that can

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
highlight

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
can reveal to us what the foundations of

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,840
open source are

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
who they are what they do why they

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,359
matter

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,959
first who are these non-profits who are

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,519
these foundations

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,960
and yes they are primarily nonprofits uh

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
many of them incorporated in the united

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
states but there

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,840
are some incorporated canada some

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,720
incorporated around europe

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,720
some in australia

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
open source initiative is one of those

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
foundations

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,199
we also have software freedom

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
conservancy

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,280
python software foundation for the

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,720
python language openjs foundation for

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,280
javascript frameworks

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,320
the.netfoundationfor.net projects and

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,680
language

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,680
the apache software foundation for so

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
many projects including the apache web

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
server that i built my career on

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,960
the eclipse foundation the linux

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
foundation

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
and no i don't have slides this is a

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,800
conversation uh

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
the linux foundation linux australia the

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
open infrastructure foundation

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
gnome django drupal wordpress so on and

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
so forth

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,919
these days you could even include ieee

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
and oasis venerable standards

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,400
organizations

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,280
among this list of foundations

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,039
there are dozens of foundations globally

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
perhaps over 100 depending on how you

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
count them

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
most people only consciously interact

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
with a few over the course of their

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
careers

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
depending on what corner of the industry

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
that you're in

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,479
okay so

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,880
so what i've rattled off maybe a dozen

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,919
and a half foundations

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
what do they do

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
briefly these foundations keep the open

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
and open source

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
through advocacy through standards and

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
through something

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,759
extremely important and with a wonky

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
label

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,280
fiscal sponsorship so let's talk about a

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,039
few of these foundations

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
i'll start with open source initiative

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,680
the 23 year old nonprofit that was

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,280
founded

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,360
to promote and protect open source

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,199
it acts as a standards and advocacy body

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
the standard that matters for the open

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,919
source initiative

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,840
is the open source definition

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,199
now i told you i came to open source

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,880
late

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,400
it took me 10 maybe 13 years before i

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,800
realized that open source

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,160
has a definition it's not just that i

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,199
can look at the source code

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
that i can see it it is literally a

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,319
10-point definition

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,160
that includes things like that includes

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,120
a number of measures that ensure that

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
the software or any software using a

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
license that meets the open source

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
definition

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
gives us certain privileges certain

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,680
rights

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
we've got this fabulous scarf in the

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
background that you probably can't get a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,000
good look at

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,080
but it says you know

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,120
use the right to use software

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,280
the right to study to look at this look

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,919
at the source code

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,240
the right to modify the software i can

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
make changes to it

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
but not only the rights to use study and

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
modify but also the right to distribute

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
to redistribute that software and the

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,560
changes that i've made to it

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
and those are four key rights that we

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
get with open source software

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,199
and those rights are captured through

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
the open source definition

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
which is the measuring stick it's the

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ruler

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,599
that osi uses to evaluate licenses

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,240
so like most standards bodies there is a

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,960
public process by which we apply the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,080
open source definition

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,680
and that's the license review process

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,319
so for as long as osi's been around

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
we've had a license review process which

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
is a

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
it's basically a public mailing list

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,199
that interested people

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,800
uh can join you can join it yourself if

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
you're curious

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
and through that license review process

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
when new people come up with

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
uh new licenses they will submit it to

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,000
that process

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,000
there is a community of people including

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,400
osi members but

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,520
primarily not who will vet that license

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,199
turn it over scrutinize it

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
and eventually come to your decision

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
whether the community

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
sees it as conformant with the open

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,000
source definition and if it is

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,360
great we have a new open source license

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,880
on our hands

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,120
this is the legal janitorial work that

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,080
uh legal professionals at for-profit

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
companies

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
at humanitarian organizations and

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,920
government agencies

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,399
all rely on there are

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,399
there's internal documentation and

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,440
policy and processes

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,440
at organizations all over the globe that

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
by reference incorporate the open source

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,880
initiative like list of approved

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,240
licenses in the open source definition

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
having a reliable and predictable

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
license standard means that they don't

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,399
need to do the expensive

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,200
manual legal review of every single

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,560
third-party software component

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
you know if you work particularly in the

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,680
javascript space you know just how many

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,120
packages a single project can involve

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,640
if you had to review the license on

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
every single one of those in a manual

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,120
fashion

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
this just this just wouldn't pan out

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
this means that independent

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
professionals small businesses

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
researchers hobbyists

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,800
can all feel confident that their use of

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
a given piece of software is on the up

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
and up

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,360
in addition to managing the open source

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
definition osi also advocates

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
at standards and government governmental

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
bodies all over the globe to ensure that

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,120
open source is a licensing standard

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
we can continue to rely on

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
now some other foundations do advocacy

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
as work especially software freedom

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,200
conservancy

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,200
one of my favorites conservancy

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,279
fights for user freedom and copyleft

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
licensing which is a type of open source

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,440
licensing

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,360
conservancy also provides a home for

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,640
some of the most widely used open source

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
projects in existence

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,640
such as git selenium homebrew open wrt

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and samba now providing a home

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
for open source projects like that

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
that's what's called fiscal sponsorship

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
and it's an important function of

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,880
literally all of the non-profits that

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
i'm talking about here today

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
when you've got an open source project

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,839
and you've got this community asset

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,040
sure there's an open source license on

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,000
the code so that everybody can use it

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,360
but how do you how do you pay for an

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,880
event or for a meetup that you want to

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
host around your project

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
how do you receive funds to pay for your

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,839
hosting costs to the cost of your

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,720
continuous deployment and integration

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,279
pipeline

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,079
well if you are if you have a fiscal

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,240
sponsor

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,320
that is a non-profit entity that will

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,920
hold that bank account open for you that

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
will hold on to those funds for you that

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
will employ an accountant to manage

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
those funds

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
to do the accounts receivable of the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,120
accounts payable

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
and to do the tax filings because i'm

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
willing to bet

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
whether or not you've ever started an

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,920
open source project if and when you do

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,560
you probably don't also want to have to

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,480
have additional tax filings on your hand

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
that's what fiscal sponsors do not only

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
do they do that but provide

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,079
legal support ip aggregation

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,519
and technical infrastructure as well for

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,360
for whatever that project needs

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,519
so recapping what do these foundations

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
do they do a lot

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
they do a lot but it really comes down

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
to standards

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
advocacy and fiscal sponsorship and

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,360
fiscal sponsorship is a thing that

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,959
to me is just so essential and so

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,279
under recognized so why does any of this

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
matter

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,200
why does the future of open source

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
and our livelihoods or at least mine i

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
certainly

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
may you know this is my career in this

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,880
space

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
why does the future of open source in

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
our livelihoods rest

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,160
on the continued existence of these

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
non-profits

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
to answer that question i want to zoom

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,920
out just a little bit

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,959
when people talk about open source they

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
usually mean several things at once

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,320
open source as a term has been

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
overloaded with multiple layers of

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
meaning

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
it's frankly a sign of success but it's

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
also a challenge

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
in my mind there are at least three

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
layers of meaning that we we usually

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,480
imply when we say open source there's

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,360
whether something is

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,959
uh has an open source license on it is a

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,079
piece of software open source does that

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,160
have an open source license then yes

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
then there's open collaboration which is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
the kind of ex

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
the kind of collaboration the kind of

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,320
environment that we have grown used to

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,480
with open source where you've got

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
you've got your project and i can submit

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
i can add issues to it i can submit pull

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,440
requests or change requests

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
i'm able to interact with your project

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
and contribute to it

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,720
so you have the open license open source

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,480
license we have the open collaboration

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
and then there's also open governance

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,600
and open governance is so so critical it

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
ensures that it's very clear how these

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
projects are managed

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
what are what are what's the on ramp to

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,399
becoming a

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,920
not just a contributor but having the

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,279
commit bit being a maintainer

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
you know how is it that technical

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,800
decisions are made how do you decide

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,519
what the road map for the project is

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
what's in scope and what's out of scope

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,399
that's all

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,480
governance and so with open source there

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,240
are these multiple layers

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
when we say open source often we're

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
referring to projects that mean

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,160
that are both open source licensed have

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
an open collaboration model

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
and have open governance but there are

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,199
lots of projects that don't meet all

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,839
those criteria that are still

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,000
technically open source one example is

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,279
the android open source project

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
you know the thing that's running on my

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
mobile phone here

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,519
yes it's an open source license project

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,480
but no google doesn't accept

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
contributions for other

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,320
from other people unless maybe you're an

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
oem so it's an open source project but

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
there's no open collaboration and

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,680
there's certainly no open governance

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,079
so it's really important to understand

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,320
what we mean when we say open source

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,120
what layers of meaning are we implying

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,399
in that

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
and to be explicit about that

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,680
you've got the news recently you've

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
probably heard about companies

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,639
re-licensing their software

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
alaska redis entry

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,680
companies that were built around open

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,959
source projects

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
projects that even accepted

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,600
contributions from people like you and

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,120
me

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,120
because but because of a technicality

00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
when their investors were displeased

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
with the returns that they were getting

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
on those

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
on those projects because of the

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,639
technicality these companies were

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,199
allowed to re-license those projects

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,040
and make them no longer available to you

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
the contributor

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,680
author of some contributions under that

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
same license

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,079
critically these are examples when you

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
read the news it's critical to

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,240
understand that these are examples of

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,079
yes there's an open source license yes

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,199
there's even open collaboration to do

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,959
to a degree but no there is not any open

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
governance here

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,320
and this is one area where foundations

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,880
come in

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,759
no project governed by a non-profit

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,839
foundation

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,440
is gonna pull that kind of nonsense with

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
their community

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
there are other challenges with

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,279
foundations don't get me wrong they're

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
not a panacea

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
and they're hard work and we have to

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,160
hold them accountable

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
but they don't have the profit motive to

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,279
just blanket re-license

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
this open source project that you might

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,600
have built your career on that you might

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
have contributed

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
untold hours to

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
think also about this the slew of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
security issues that have been hitting

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
the news

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,120
open source software supply chain

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,959
attacks squatting on package managers

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
unauthorized changes to authoritative

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,040
code bases like php just a couple days

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,519
ago

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,480
a lot of that can be chalked up to

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,519
uneven standards of care

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,839
often correlated with uneven resources

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,800
and projects relying on overworked

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,600
volunteer

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,759
maintainers foundations

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
are also a channel through which funding

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,079
can flow to pay maintainers

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,680
there are many foundations that maintain

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,680
that pay a small staff

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,240
of core contributors to keep those

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
projects ticking

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
that's been true to an extent for a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,680
while but we're seeing a

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,560
big uptick in that and i think we're

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
going to see more of that

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,560
paying maintainers so that they can get

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
the job done and take care of this

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,079
software

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
is another important way to make sure

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,400
that the software we use

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,760
is robust and reliable but even setting

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
aside the issues of the day

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,199
keeping the lights on at all of these

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,600
foundations is critical

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
to ensuring we all continue to enjoy the

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,160
benefits

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,600
of a large reliable commons of software

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,600
that's ready to use modify and

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,360
redistribute

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,319
current events just make the threats to

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,319
the commons more clear

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,200
now what is our role as creators and

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,840
consumers of open source software

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
in light of all this

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,799
look i went most of my career without

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,480
knowing foundations existed

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,480
i could have probably gone my entire

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,919
career without even realizing it

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,200
even though i was regularly interacting

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,760
with the drupal association and just

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,760
didn't know it

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,160
if foundations remain hidden

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,840
infrastructure

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,600
as this industry just continues to

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,520
balloon on top of this infrastructure

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,520
this foundation that exists for us all

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
if these non-profits remain under

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
supported

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,720
under recognized

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,559
well they may well continue to host the

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,760
projects we all rely on

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,840
but they're not going to be able to

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,640
invest in those projects to keep them

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,120
secure

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,400
and maintained and constantly evolving

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,400
in response to community needs

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,600
so if nothing else in this talk if you

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
take

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,799
nothing else away from this talk i want

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
you to

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,520
to leave today knowing that

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,520
there are dozens if not hundreds of

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,640
non-profit foundry foundations

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,520
that make our work possible

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,679
that they are non-profit they do need

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,440
your sponsorship

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
they do need your individual support

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
and we need to talk about them we need

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
to tell our co-workers about them we

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,039
need to tell our peers in the industry

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,080
about them so that we're aware

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,960
of this this foundation that we're all

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,520
working on top of

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,520
so just two very specific takeaways

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
please consider looking at the

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
foundations in the space in the

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
technology

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,320
in the area of the technologies that you

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
use i listed about half a dozen

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,559
foundations at least

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
i can guarantee there's a foundation

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,440
associated with some of the most

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,400
popular open source projects that you

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,480
use find those foundations

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,200
and continue consider if you can afford

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,280
it becoming a paying supporter

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,360
better yet if you are employed

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,200
as a software developer or as any sort

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
of contributor

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
in the tech industry if you are in a

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,720
company that benefits from open source

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,080
software and i guarantee that you are

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,400
try to build the case at your company

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280
that sponsoring these projects is not

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
just

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,720
the right thing to do it's not just

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,600
generous

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,039
but it's absolutely essential in terms

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,720
of managing that business's risk

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,400
and long-term viability to make sure

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,720
that the software you're building on

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,720
will be here today tomorrow and into the

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:19,039
future

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:19,039
