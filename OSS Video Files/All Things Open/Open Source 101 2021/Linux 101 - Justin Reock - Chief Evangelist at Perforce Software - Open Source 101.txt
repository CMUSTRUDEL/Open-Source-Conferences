hi

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,559
thanks so much and uh thanks everybody

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
for attending today

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,160
uh this is actually the third time that

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440
i've given this talk

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,000
at an all things open or os 101 event

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
um and uh and it's continued to kind of

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
evolve from from each time as linux has

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
sort of continued to grow

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
but i really like this forum for this

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,039
talk specifically the open source 101

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,240
um i want to say this is my third year i

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,880
was just thinking about it in first

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,200
grade

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
my third year or my fourth year doing uh

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
participating in os 101 and i really

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
i really love this show and i think that

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
you know especially

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
um you know the students in this

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
audience and folks who are just sort of

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
coming into this industry you're coming

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
at a very interesting time

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
uh when you know we're looking at kind

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
of our

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
you know i i heard a statistic recently

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
from idc that

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,000
66 of the global gdp 66 of the products

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,280
that are paid for

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
will be digital assets uh by the end of

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
this year

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,080
by 2022 and a lot of that you know i

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
think our current

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,200
landscape and everything has accelerated

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
some of that and of course the pandemic

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
and everything

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
but it's really quite a time to be

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
coming into software

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,520
and this taught specifically linux

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
uh if linux isn't already in your tool

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,159
belt

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,720
now is really the time uh linux is

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
underpinning so many of these other

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
supportive technologies that are really

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
changing

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
uh and evolving the way that we develop

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
software now

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
um it's underpinning containers uh you

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
know

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,119
there is no container orchestration and

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
all this stuff without

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,200
you know solid linux uh linux-like and

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
analytics-driven

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,320
uh operating systems underpinning all of

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
it

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
um and so you know linux is is a

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,119
discipline

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
more so than an operating system as

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
you'll see but it's something that's

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
really going to help you i think

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
leverage a lot of other open source

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,960
technologies and a lot of other

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,399
uh modern and devops friendly tool

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,759
chains that are out there so anyway i

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
really like giving this talk

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,360
specifically at open source 101 i hope

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
you enjoy it uh please

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
feel free to stop me at any point um if

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
you have a question i'm going to do my

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,560
best

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
to check the q a panel you know this is

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
a new format for everybody i'm used to

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
doing these talks in person like i think

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
most people are

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
um so it actually helps me to have some

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
of that interaction

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,360
uh so that i don't feel like a crazy

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,040
person just uh recording uh to my

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
computer in my office

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
so so anyway i appreciate that so let's

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
get going uh first

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,760
a little bit more about me i am the

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
chief evangelist uh

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
over our open source and api management

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
assets at perforce

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840
uh per force is a company really that

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
has a portfolio of a lot of different

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
devops

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
technologies in it one of them is our

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
open logic

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
offering which is basically just an

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,519
offering that

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
allows us to uh provide support for

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
enterprises that want to use free

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
software and i also oversee our api

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
management part of our portfolio which

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
is our icon of product

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
my background is very much in software

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
development uh but as

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
as i've kind of moved through that role

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,360
and and moved through

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,959
into more leadership work and more

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
uh i guess of this type of thing

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,560
speaking at conferences and evangelizing

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,280
uh you know that work has has changed uh

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,200
from from

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
software development to more talking

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
about development and trends and

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
development uh and new things that are

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
happening there

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,760
so there's a lot of the work that i that

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,799
i do now feel free to look me up on

connect

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
i'm you know the networks are so

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
important uh in

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,959
especially in open source circles um

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
it's a very social uh means of

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
development uh

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
that is open source uh so please feel

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,959
free to reach out

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,040

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
share a lot of stuff i do have a lot of

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,159
these types of webinars and talks things

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,200
that you can already sort of find out

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
there if you want to look at some of

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,480
that content as well

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,560
so so anyway feel free to reach out okay

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,760
let's talk about uh linux

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
so in order to really understand linux

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
you have to understand the history of

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,720
the unix

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
operating system and you know

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
specifically the class of operating

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
systems that start up as unix operating

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
systems so this is back in the 70s with

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,120
bell labs

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
and the introduction of the early bell

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,320
labs operating systems that

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
spun out into the berkeley um software

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,759
distribution

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
of unix and that ultimately became sun

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,880
os

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
which you know is a commercial solaris

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,560
product meanwhile

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,040
you know kind of alongside all of this

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,040
heavy and commercial

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,880
unix development the gnu project

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,320
which spun out of the free software

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,120
foundation had started supporting

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,400
a small open source operating system

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
project called

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
linux which would ultimately become gnu

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
linux

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
and that would become you know the

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
android operating system and ultimately

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
would become

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
um you know linux as we know it now but

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,520
alongside all of this

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,199
you know earlier variants of the unix

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,039
operating system were just sort of

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
blooming all over the place right we had

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
solaris with center west the next step

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
operating system which would which would

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,360
evolve into

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,440
the mac os x operating system that we

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,800
know now which is still

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,560
powered by bsd its core

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,120
um on the svr 5 distributions which were

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
you know these heavy uh enterprise class

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,520
and sometimes even mainframe

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,520
uh distributions of unix uh we're

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
spending on including things like hp ux

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,440
and solarix and ibm

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,720
aix right so linux as an open source

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
operating system

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
was very much evolving alongside uh

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,000
these sort of heavyweight unix operating

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,800
systems that were powering you know big

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
uh commercial uh heavyweight software so

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
this is an example of the boomed up

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,120
screen of

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,000
an sdr five variant uh vhp ux variant

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
uh on a hewlett packard workstation and

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
if you're familiar at all with you know

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
the boot up screen of like the red hat

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,560
variant of linux for instance this might

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
look a little bit familiar right because

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
some of that uh

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
uh some of these boot sequences and

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
things like that were inspired by

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,639
uh these commercial and enterprise class

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
um

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
distributions of unix i mean certainly

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
red hat enterprise linux and its

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,479
variants

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
uh are aimed towards an enterprise

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,840
audience right um and so they they solve

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
a lot of the same

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
uh a lot of the same problems and they

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,199
speak to a lot of the same use cases

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,400
so so that's a bit of a history of units

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,120
but let's take a look at linux's history

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,560
like we see in this slide because you

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
know sort of on its own

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,759
uh linux itself has had uh um

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
a really interesting and and colorful

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
history

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,919
um it all began with uh linus torvald

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,240
uh probably you're familiar with he's an

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,960
employee now of the linux foundation

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
uh which is a fantastic organization by

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,160
the way if you're not involved in some

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
way with the linux foundation at least

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
signing up for their free events which

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
are

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
you know usually hundreds of dollars

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
just like

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
a lot of these other conferences now are

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
free right now while they're remote you

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
know definitely take advantage of

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
this uh community too a lot of a lot of

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
us who are involved in open source 101

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
and then all things open you're going to

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
see us talking at linux foundation

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,919
events as well

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,840
there's just a lot of overlap between

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,759
these various communities so the linux

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,280
foundation employs linus torvald the

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,720
inventor of linux and we just sort of

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,960
posted to this uh

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,199
you know open source uh mailing list hey

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
i'm gonna i'm gonna do this free

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
you know version of an operating system

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
it's not gonna be a big deal right it

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,319
was

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
you can go and look up the post it's

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,039
kind of like a little bit of history

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
um and it's funny because he was very

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
humble about

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,879
his ambitions for the linux project when

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
he first put it out it really was just

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,919
this

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,919
you know hey let's make a free unix

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,440
variant let's see how it does i think

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,360
it's just going to be a hobby thing and

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
and if you look at how this is now

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
shaped you know the landscape of free

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
software

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
since the first release of linux and

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,520
then seeing it split into major

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,840
distributions like dbn and red hat

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
uh debian was one of the first uh linux

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
flavors that i really got

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
super interested in and and you know was

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
was building and everything like that

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
back in the 90s and it's still a very

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,560
um uh popular variant you can still

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
download pure debian

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
it's uh it's what powers uh as raspberry

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,440
pi or raspbian linux is based on debian

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,599
abundantly linux is based on different

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
of course red hat also a little software

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
company that at the time was

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
was was uh those of you who were in the

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,519
industry at this time might remember

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
that

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,680
they were basically just a software

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
catalog catalog magazine like literally

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
you could go and buy

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
red hat magazine and you would have a

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
software cd and everything like that

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
and they spun out their own variant of

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,000
linux which became the red hat

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,959
enterprise linux operating system now

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
it's a

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,320
free version of that it's called centos

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
if you're uh

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
if you're kind of watching that that's a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
very interesting space right now

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
with the announcement of something

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,800
called centos stream which is a rolling

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,240
distribution of centos linux

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
it's causing a bit of disruption in the

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,760
industry

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,120
anyway you know linux was profoundly

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
disruptive in the industry especially in

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,560
the server side of the industry at first

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,240
because it it really did bring

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
all of the power of these commercial

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,279
unix operating systems to commodity

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
hardware

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,880
and it was 100 free free and open source

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,720
gpl

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
uh gpl driven which means you know

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
militant enforcement of free software

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
gpl is a very important license because

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,240
it says if you want to modify the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
software you have to share those changes

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
with everybody and that's what protects

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
us

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
protects the linux and its innovation as

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
an operating system

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,160
uh so fast forward to now we saw you

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,720
know pretty recently a huge acquisition

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,640
uh ibm acquiring red hat for it's like a

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
36 billion dollar purchase

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,880
a big bet on red hat's open shift

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
technology which is

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,480
of course it's it's it's play for

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,120
container-based orchestration based on

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,560
kubernetes and uh some of red hat's

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,320
uh you know other curated technologies

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
and technologies that it borrowed from

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
other sources like

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
like open vswitch and things like that

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
we said pretty shortly thereafter

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,120
susie you know is a huge linux presence

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
in

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
europe uh purchased rancher labs uh as

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
sort of a gauntlet i think to throw it

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
out in the in the container

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
orchestration uh space and uh you know

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
if you've had a chance to play with

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,959
rancher

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
i think agree it's it's really fantastic

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
technology and it's free and open source

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,160
and allows you to

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
spin out kubernetes pretty much anywhere

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,440
but you know you don't have these things

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,040
you don't have

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,920
um a huge open source ecosystem

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,800
an operating system based open source

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
ecosystem

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
without linux i mean linux just drove

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
all this it was it provided fuel and a

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,320
platform for all these other open source

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,000
technologies to really flourish

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
and move into the enterprise and not

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,160
enough i think has spoken about

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
linus torvald's invention of git right i

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,160
mean

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,640
you know he invents linux and disrupts

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,880
the operating system server market

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,519
and then git i think in many ways has

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
been even more important than linux

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
as a foundation for social and

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,720
collaborative coding

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,920
uh and a real vehicle for open source

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
development as a methodology right so so

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,959
i really think you know

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,360
you watch git as a source control

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
mechanism for all of these distributed

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
open source

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,240
projects that are meant to run on the

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,720
linux operating system

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
and it's just incredible sort of the the

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
whole you know

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
galaxy of free software that's available

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
now that really is just sort of

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,240
underpinned by linux and developed on

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
you know you can get using github and

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,160
it's all

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
it's all been uh it all interoperates it

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
one doesn't really work without the

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
other

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
so why think about developing on linux

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
you know we understand some of the

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,880
history of it why do people get so

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
excited about

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
putting linux on something um i'm seeing

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
a question come up

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,920
will we have access to all these slides

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
for future reference actually they are

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,519
already out there from the last time i

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,839
presented this on my slideshare

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
um so if you just search for linux 101

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,399
and you put my name in

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
you'll you'll find the slides out there

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,200
on slideshare but i i think they're all

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,519
getting posted again

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
for this show too so and i did actually

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,240
dust off a few things and make a couple

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,600
of updates here

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
um so as far as i know yes uh

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,839
we're gonna have all this stuff posted

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,440
uh um and speak to the coordinators

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
about that but yeah just by no means a

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
proprietary

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,040
talk or anything welcome to it um

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,200
okay uh so lots of reasons to develop

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
on linux uh powerful command line and

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,639
tools okay

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
uh once you get comfortable using the

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
command line

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,399
uh you can do everything on the machine

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
that you could do using a ui but you can

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
do it faster

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,079
and you can do it uh more efficiently

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,360
remotely okay so logging in remotely to

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,600
a linux server

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,839
that you might have posted out on amazon

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
or google cloud or something like that

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,160
logging into it through a command line

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,800
and console interface

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,720
requires way less data pushed over so

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
you're not like streaming a desktop or

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
anything like that

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,320
like you might be used to and so you

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
know the idea of you know running into

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,600
glitches and issues when you're trying

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,040
to administer that machine because of

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,880
streaming problems or stuff

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
just doesn't really happen like you can

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
use a command line

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
effectively in very low bandwidth

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,360
conditions

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
and still be really effective on that

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
box okay so

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
uh and it just gives you a nice

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,420
ubiquitous universal way to

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
interact with the operating system um

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,360
[Music]

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
a lot of options for productivity

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
improvement that come alongside that

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
command line

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,399
so if you think about automating ui

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,800
driven applications right

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,199
it's kind of hard right we look at a

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,760
look at a utility like selenium ide for

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
instance

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,440
for testing of web pages or testing ui

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
driven applications

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,120
right uh it's a that's a very powerful

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,240
platform but it's complicated to record

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,560
clicks and try to pull metrics back and

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
sometimes you know interacting with

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,839
whatever messenger process is

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
responsible for sending data between the

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
view and the control and the model and

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
everything it doesn't quite line up

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
with what selenium is trying to pull out

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
or its metrics but

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
when you're dealing with just text when

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
you're dealing with just a command line

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,519
that you can throw

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,199
commands at you have a scripting

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,959
environment then that can take multiple

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,959
scripting languages and you can turn

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
around and be way more productive

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,320
this is where you know it becomes really

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
easy to administer

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
a linux box remotely using something

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
like ansible

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,680
or even spinning up uh cloud linux

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
assets using

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,959
orchestration technologies like

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,320
terraform right it's the fact that you

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,240
can be so powerful

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
from just a text-based interface that

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,320
just unlocks a whole lot of uh different

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,680
productivity tools that are just harder

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,800
this is harder to do in a in a gui

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,760
right uh is free is in free speech and

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
it will always be

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,440
linux at kernel kernel.org is under the

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,240
gpl

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
the gpl again i really you know go look

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
at what the gpl software does

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,760
uh gpl licensing software does and in

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,959
fact if you look

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,199
uh for me i do a talk on it's called

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,760
building the holodeck

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,360
and i talk a lot about the gpl in that

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,279
talk and i talk about how important it

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
is to have a license that says hey

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,639
we can all have access to this software

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,440
no matter what it can all be free for

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
everybody

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,759
but if you improve it and you want to

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
use it commercially

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
you have to give that source code back

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,440
you have to if you if you made it better

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
you have to give it back and that's it

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
you know it's it's you don't have to pay

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
anybody

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,959
you never have to pay anybody for

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,560
anything like that if you modify it and

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,160
you improve it you have to let it let

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,720
other people know how you improved it

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,040
right

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
and that little mechanism is so

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,360
important because

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
you can in fact get sued as a commercial

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,920
organization

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,240
uh if you don't abide by that uh and so

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,519
there are some teeth and that means that

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,199
that

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
that there is almost a militant

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,680
enforcement of innovation on these

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,440
products

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
uh which again it's very important it's

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
easy for people to get greedy

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
and try to take these products and go

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
and create something

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
you know new with them and then close

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
them off but that and that's fine

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,320
there's nothing actually wrong with that

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
software development model

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
it's just a different software

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,639
development model than open source

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,759
there's nothing wrong with it

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,000
but it's not linux's

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,839
uh open source development methodology

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
it's not linux's development methodology

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
right

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
this is always going to be free free

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
speech modifiable customizable community

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
driven you can do whatever you want with

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
the software

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,959
uh ease of prototyping because

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
linux is meant to be a flexible server

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
size opera a server-side operating

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
system

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,120
it just integrates seamlessly with the

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
notion of a web server running on it for

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,839
instance right instead of having a

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
separate server processor and you do

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,199
have a separate process running but

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
you're just sort of seamlessly

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,079
integrated with the file system

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,400
and file system permissions and security

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
uh

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,000
layers and stuff within the operating

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,760
system um because of that because it's

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,439
sort of ubiquitous and because it's like

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,839
where all these other platforms that you

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,839
might be developing against like node.js

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,959
if you're on the node side or go lang if

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,839
you're like go

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,240
rust even you know rust is now starving

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,559
to really come into

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
linux and you've seen see a couple of

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,200
articles that have gotten published

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,960
recently on that

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
because there's so much ubiquity in the

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,880
operating system it's really easy to

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
prototype modern applications on linux

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,480
right so as a developer it's just a very

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
flexible environment to do

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
all the things that you'd be expected to

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,520
do like

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
like like develop an application that's

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,640
supposed to run behind a web server

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,720
or um you know run a really powerful

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,320
python environment to do deep learning i

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
mean who knows right

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
the point is it's really easy to install

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
free software on linux

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,039
and you can deploy it anywhere and you

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,520
don't have to ask anybody

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,640
before you do it so you know very easy

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
to start prototyping your apps

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
easy recreation and production

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
environments it's kind of what i was

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,080
talking about

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,720
and this has been made even easier

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,840
through utilities like docker

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,559
right one of the most powerful um

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,440
things that a container gives us is that

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,240
parity

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
between the area where we're developing

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
and the area where we're deploying and

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
running and that's so important for

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,880
devops it's literally

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,000
part of the 12 factor app development

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,200
methodology

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,559
and it's again very easy to to recreate

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,240
production environments using

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,919
linux because you just don't have much

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,600
in the way of like proprietary or

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,960
specialty stuff going in there

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,360
in most cases it's a very composable

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,200
environment so it's really easy to throw

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
declarative configuration utilities

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,919
again like ansible and things like that

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,320
at it

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
so it's it's it's very easy to make sure

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,400
that where you're developing has parody

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,520
with where you run your software

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
um and better

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
better web development again natural

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
environment for apache or nginx

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,679
hardened security options such as se

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,120
linux go learn about se linux don't be

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,160
afraid of it anymore

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,200
um it it used to be a thing where we all

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
would

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
fire up linux in the first thing we

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
would try to launch a web server or

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
something and something would break and

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
we would get a permissions failure and

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,679
we're like ah

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,960
just disable seonix oh great it works

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,320
well

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,559
don't do that anymore there's a really

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,480
good suite of tools out there available

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
uh tools like audits you allow for

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,440
instance uh

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,919
that will that make it much easier to

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,200
embrace the way that se linux wants to

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,880
harden your environment

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
and it makes a big difference right the

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,919
uh one of the uh

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
um one of the uh examples of this that i

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,799
like to point to even though the example

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
is getting a little bit old now but for

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,679
any of you who might be android

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,280
enthusiasts or have done development on

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,320
android or even a little bit of android

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,960
packing maybe

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
you know custom roms or or boot locker

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
unloading

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
or rooting or any of that fun stuff

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,200
right um you might remember if you've

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,360
been doing this for a while

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,039
that up until around android kitkat or

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
something it was like 4.4 or something

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,200
like that

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,760
um it was easy right it was just

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
easy to find exploits even if the phone

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,600
wasn't meant to be unlocked

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
you could go on xda forums or something

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
like that somebody had a utility out

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,559
really quickly you could do it right it

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,799
just

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,480
wasn't hard to quote unquote break the

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,080
phone and it was you know

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,600
just a lot of times sometimes the

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
manufacturer would just allow you to do

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,440
it that was nice but other times

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
you have to take advantage of an exploit

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
like actually an exploit in the

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,200
operating system to unlock the hardware

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,159
right

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,960
um well a lot of people who are in this

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
uh

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,000
um you know in this development

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
community might remember that around the

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,120
time of 4.4

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,120
android by default started turning on se

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,080
linux in an enforcing mode

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,960
and suddenly what was taking you know

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,200
developers

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,120
a few weeks to figure out exploits

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
around this stuff was taking like years

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,760
like like there were there were phones

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
that were not meant to be unlocked that

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
took like a year and a half

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,880
to finally find a workable exploit to

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,600
unlock and the only thing

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
the only reason for that was sd linux

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
like really

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,520
that's the only i mean that's that is

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,600
the difference in how

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,200
hardened uh you can create a linux

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,320
environment that has s linux turned on

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
versus off so

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
uh learn more about that especially if

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
security is something that's going to be

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,200
a

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,200
focus for you uh absolutely uh paved the

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
way for containers and microservices uh

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,760
the way that containers work

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,120
rely on uh the way that the linux file

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,799
system works and i'm gonna actually show

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
you an example of that

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
automations we've talked about that

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
remote administration through ssh

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,480
scales to huge sizes without license

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,840
plus and linux makes you look cool

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,240
and it still does um it's the original

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
home

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,360
of the lamp stack so linux apache mysql

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,919
php this has evolved a lot since then

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,400
now

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,320
these tend to look more like linux

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,520
node.js

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,600
yeah who knows couchdb or or neo4j

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,960
or postgres or something like that or

00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
cockroachdb i've seen a lot of that

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
lately

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,799
and then uh you know node.js or golang

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
or something like that

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,840
still a lot of php out there obviously

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,679
still a lot of other languages like

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,520
python which are powering good platforms

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,120
like drupal or whatnot but

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,880
um uh wordpress and you know java is

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,799
still relevant of course too with uh

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,559
spring boot contact with that

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,320
uh all of these things by the way very

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,120
easy to prototype in a linux environment

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,000
by design

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,280
using free software again uh are there

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
downsides to it

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,520
um sure you know i think one of them is

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,559
um that there's too many different ways

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,080
to create like linux native apps still

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,840
we have all these different apis and

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
frameworks and runtime environments and

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
tools

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,400
and and this is important where it's

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,200
where it's i think to stop for a second

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,280
consider what linux actually is

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
so you've got the linux kernel that's

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,240
the kernel.org code

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,600
that's the very minimum code that needs

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,720
to deploy

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,159
a basic linux environment on a piece of

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
hardware

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,120
so that anything running in that

00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
environment will have access to the

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
hardware

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,600
network you know process or whatever but

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
it's extraordinarily bare bones we're

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,760
not there's no ui

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,360
even a you know the default shell uh

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,840
is is very stripped down right

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,960
so when you're using linux when you're

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
using like a

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,679
like a desktop class linux like ubuntu

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,679
or something like that

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,520
you're using the linux kernel but

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
there's this suite of software that are

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,320
that's often top level projects that are

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,280
going to be found in

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,480
other flavors of linux too that are

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
making up your whole

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
experience if you will right so you have

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,760
a linux kernel but if you want to use a

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,240
desktop environment you might have heard

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,919
of like

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,520
gnome or kde i'm going to show you

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,000
pictures of those those are

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,799
top level open source projects of their

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
own

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,760
right i mean they there's obviously a

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
lot of interplay between the linux

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,400
communities and those

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
those known communities and stuff but

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
they're not locked to any one version of

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,159
linux right the gnome ui

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
is on lots of different flavors of linux

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,159
right so is the kde

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,320
ui right and other ones um so

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
so the point is we start with the linux

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,799
kernel and then all these different

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,760
flavors of linux have kind of bloomed or

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,559
evolved

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
based on how those software communities

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,520
have

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,840
curated the supporting software all

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,440
right so i start with my linux kernel

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
what ui do i want you know what

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,760
graphical environment do i want

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
if i want one at all how do i want to

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,880
support

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,200
printers on my network right there's a

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,480
whole top level project just for

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,120
printer control called cups you know

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
what

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
command line interface do i want to use

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
bash or z

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,640
shell or k shell or corn all these other

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,919
ones that are available

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,279
um you know it's a very plugable

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,640
uh operating system makes it highly

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,880
customizable

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,520
um and and that's why you see all these

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
different flavors of linux like debian

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,960
and centos

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,400
and ubuntu and you know these new these

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,320
ones that are like coming in to replace

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,080
santos stream now like alma linux and

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,480
rocky linux and stuff like that

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
these are all based on you know who's

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,520
the supporting community

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,679
uh what pieces have we chosen and

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,360
curated what other top level open source

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,760
projects have we've taken and added to

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,279
this distribution to make a full

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,880
operating system experience

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,320
right so it's important to understand

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
that but with that comes

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
a lot of fragmentation and it can be a

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,080
little overwhelming at first

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
you know especially if you've been used

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,360
to what we would call a vertically

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,240
integrated operating system

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,880
something like like mac or even windows

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,760
where

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,600
you know your experience is pretty much

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
on rails you know there's other software

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,440
that you're going to be able to install

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,200
but in terms of like what you get for

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
your ui environment

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,480
how you're gonna you know take care of

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
configuration

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
um you know things like how you'll

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
handle software drivers and updates and

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
things

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,400
uh how you'll install software those are

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,120
largely sort of on rails right with

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,120
linux you have a lot of choices

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,159
you'll end up really appreciating the

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,400
flexibility

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
but at a 101 level i understand it

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,760
really can be

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,200
can be overwhelming um and so it's best

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,400
to you know start with some of these

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,480
highly curated

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,760
uh versions like linux mint or ubuntu

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,760
or centos is you know really a good

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,400
approachable linux as well

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,919
um and get your head around how package

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
management works and how

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,159
those communities have curated that

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,960
software and what your options are and

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,400
how you know

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
you know the different mechanisms of

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,760
installing software uh because then

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,360
you'll start to understand sort of

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
abstractly

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,400
you know how to approach these operating

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,919
systems then like you'll approach maybe

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
a flavor of linux that you've never seen

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,159
before

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,039
but you'll know what questions to ask

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,000
you're like alright what's the

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,559
bootloader

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,159
what's the package manager what's the

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,000
what's the shell

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,840
you know what's the what's the ui and

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,480
then as you start getting familiar with

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,159
some of these

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
you know bits and pieces that really do

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,240
overlap i mean for instance

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,840
ubuntu debian raspberry pi

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,279
um you know a number of other ones that

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,200
i just can't pull off the top of my head

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,840
all use the same package manager called

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
apps and

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,679
meanwhile i would turn around and look

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
at red hat enterprise linux or amazon

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,440
linux or

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,720
centos linux or scientific linux or some

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,880
of these other derivatives and they all

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,600
use the same package manager called yum

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,200
right and so so you find a lot of

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
overlap but you really just sort of have

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
to get comfortable with

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
thinking about linux as an ecosystem uh

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,600
but it is a challenge

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,080
right um still an orphan desktop

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,039
uh even uh whoops update that date yeah

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
it even shows you

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
i have gotten some mileage out of this

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,600
uh presentation

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,200
um uh we're still waiting on the year of

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,480
the linux desktop

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,720
and it's been kind of a joke um now

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,320
what's funny is that we may already be

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,279
here and not really know it

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,960
uh in that windows now has a full linux

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,760
subsystem for windows that you might be

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,919
familiar with

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,760
it's a prerequisite for running docker

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,679
on windows and things like that

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,200
and there has been all kinds of

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,760
speculation when you look at the fact

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,919
that like

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,000
azure azure cloud now has more linux on

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,240
it than it does windows server

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,760
and things like that um there's a lot of

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,520
this like well

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,120
could we actually be coming to a time

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,919
now where one day windows

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,080
is actually just gonna be a gooey layer

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
like a gnome or a kde that's sitting on

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,000
top of a linux kernel and it's really

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,919
you know it's not it's not hard to

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,960
conceive of that even though that would

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,760
have been

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,720
beyond crazy talk uh like 10 years ago

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,960
and and

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
before that i mean the stuff of legend

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,880
so i i think

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,279
one of the best quotes you know best but

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
but

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,600
simon the times quotes was when steve

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,399
ballmer evangelist for microsoft

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
called linux of cancer that devours

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,159
anything

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,320
from uh from an ip standpoint

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,679
uh and now again linux is number one

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,760
money maker for

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,000
azure cloud and there's a whole linux

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,240
subsystem baked into windows right so uh

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,240
so things change

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
uh so how do you get started right well

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,120
first thing you gotta pick a flavor

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
again we said just the kernel with the

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,120
suite of supporting software

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,880
and that's supporting software is what

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,919
differentiates one flavor from another

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,279
so really you want to

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,760
pick one that kind of suits your level

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,039
of expertise what tools you think you're

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
likely to use i mean be kind of

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,600
thoughtful about how you want to use the

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,240
environment is it a development

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,799
environment

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
do you want your ides like eclipse and

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,679
intellij

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
and stuff like that really accessible do

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,240
you want to have docker running on there

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
right out of the box

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
i mean is that the kind of environment

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
that you're wanting to build or are you

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,039
trying to build like an iot environment

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,399
for something stripped down

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,679
you know or just a fun project um like i

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,520
probably should have turned on my office

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,440
tv but i have like a mame

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,320
project behind me that'll you know do

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,360
old arcade demo reels and stuff and uh

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,880
um and

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
and things like that so it really you

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,279
know think about what it is that you

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,080
want to do

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,200
um and sometimes by the way getting

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,520
started with those small

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
projects is actually you know a really

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
good approach

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,080
on the other side of my office here i

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,880
have a wall board which is powered by an

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,480
open source project called yodek

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,880
which is a special build of raspberry pi

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,640
linux it runs on a raspberry pi and it

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,840
allows you to build a customizable wall

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,279
board like the ones that you see in

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
elevators and stuff so you can put you

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,360
know

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,000
rss feeds and news feeds and custom

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,360
stuff all over it right so um so that's

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,600
another way that you can get started is

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
to pick like a project like that

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,520
um main differences include package

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,039
management pre-installed software the

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
current linux kernel version that's

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,080
installed

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,880
uh take a look at the community too you

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
really want

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,039
a community that's uh you know quick to

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,159
release they respond quickly to security

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
vulnerabilities

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,559
they have a lot you know development

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,159
priorities most of the mainstream

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,679
flavors of linux you can get this

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,039
information pretty easily you can go to

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,039
the main project site

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,640
click about or the community section

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,080
it'll talk a little bit about the

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,440
you know the board of directors of the

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
community and you can understand how the

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
communities

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
govern um and that'll give you some

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,320
clues about you know

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,679
the sustainability of this uh flavor of

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
linux and whether you should think about

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,559
using

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,679
your work and that sort of thing some

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
distributions are also

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,279
very highly focused like for instance

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,880
kali linux for security professionals is

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,399
one of the best known i think usher

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,000
focused versions of linux

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,600
it comes pre-installed with a whole

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,159
bunch of like white hat

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
uh hacking tools like metasploit nessus

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,880
things like that

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,559
uh and really is everything that you

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,880
could need to do you know

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,240
like high-grade professional penetration

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,960
testing i mean this is what

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,720
the professionals use um so it's very

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
interesting because you know linux has

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,799
helped provide

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,640
this very open uh playing field uh

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,440
for white hat security researchers so

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,320
it's actually very transparent and easy

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,120
to understand how security researchers

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,039
are testing

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,519
software infrastructures now and what

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,720
tools they're using to scan

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,919
something for everybody just a whole

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,519
bunch of flavors here really just

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,240
demonstrating there's a lot this is not

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,919
even

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,279
close to an exhaustive list of icons

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,519
um it cross-platform development on

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,600
linux is getting a lot easier

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,919
so there is now cross-compiling options

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,919
especially uh if you look like.net 5 for

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,000
instance now you can just get a docker

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,640
mono instance and start running.net 5

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,559
applications in linux

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,679
for full virtual machines are available

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,320
in virtualbox

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,760
qmu vagrant you know vagrant if you

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,519
haven't played with vagrants is a very

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,320
good way to get started with linux like

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,679
today

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,080
you can just download the vagrant

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,919
tooling and favorite up centos and all

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
of a sudden it's going to download a vm

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,559
image for you

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
and spin it up and everything you start

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,000
using it um

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,440
libraries and platforms for across uh

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,279
for cross platform

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,440
uh deployment of like windows

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,919
applications into a linux environment

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,519
uh also getting easier uh with tools

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
like wine which stands for wine is not

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,679
an emulator it's actually a full rebuild

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,799
of the dll library for windows

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,080
and the main windows runtime uh and um

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,600
it's uh uh you know file systems now

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,360
are good and interoperable so for

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,519
sharing files between

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,279
uh you know like a windows environment

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,320
mac environment linux environment there

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,880
are some good

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,480
um you know cross architecture file

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,760
systems that make it easy to share files

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,679
between those things

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,360
let's go to question what flavor do you

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,519
recommend for a public library

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,880
the library only has windows and i'd

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,760
like to suggest to them to have a few

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,279
machines with linux

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,880
it's a great question for something like

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,640
a public library you want you want to

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,880
consider a few things right um

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,480
i think local security and security

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,840
policy very important right these are

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,360
public machines and so you don't want

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,799
anybody to be able to uh

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,000
you know do anything nefarious with them

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,279
and you want to be able to lock them

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,960
down pretty well

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,480
um you also want something that's

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,279
supported and by that i mean you

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,799
don't have to think a lot about how

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,000
often you want to update and everything

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,360
and that's because especially in a

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,880
library environment

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,000
a computer should just be a tool right

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,440
you shouldn't have to worry too much

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
about it

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
so so for something like that i would

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,039
look at an enterprise class

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,559
linux but i would look at a free one

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,760
centos stream is

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,799
the the newest rolling release as we

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,000
call it version

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,679
of uh the free version of the red hat

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,279
enterprise linux operating system so

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,200
using centos

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,799
feels almost identical to using

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,760
redheaded enterprise linux so very

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,320
friendly

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,919
for setting up there's a ecosystem works

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,079
well with printers and all that great

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,399
stuff

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,280
but with centos it's 100 free and open

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,320
source

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,240
um it's because of gpl that this exists

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,879
right it's a binary equivalent to red

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,919
hat

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,399
now the streaming part of this is kind

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,000
of new

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,879
centos stream uh the centos

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,359
community has said they're going to

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,440
focus on the stream distribution um

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,599
for a server environment for server

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,760
environments that's been problematic for

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,320
some businesses who are not fully devops

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
mature yet you can't do cd yet

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,159
and on a fully automated cd it's been a

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,879
little problematic for organizations

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,359
like that

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,159
for a desktop environment not a problem

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,679
right i mean

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,599
for the most part in a desktop

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
environment you kind of

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,040
have a rolling release anyway you have

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,680
update tuesdays and you're taking

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,000
updates

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,720
often if you don't like something you

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,040
can just

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,800
you know uninstall it or whatever so for

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,400
for an interactive like desktop

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
environment the stream concern really

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,359
isn't that big of a deal either i've

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
been using stream now for a while and

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,880
it's just fine it really doesn't

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,839
mess up too much stuff but i certainly

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,359
understand where people are a little

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,880
concerned on the server side with it

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,160
we have some tips around that too if

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
you're interested but yeah i would

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
probably say

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
centos is a great pick for uh for a

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,560
library environment

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,520
uh if that seems to enterprise server

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,000
for you though

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,560
you just can't go wrong with ubuntu as a

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,040
desktop operating system um

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
it's it's just it's user friendly it's

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,560
stable

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,040
uh it is enterprise class uh it is what

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
we call

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,560
uh you know kernel four so it's getting

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,839
compliant with newer kernels so you

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,720
really can't go wrong with that one

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,320
either

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,880
and if and if for some reason you just

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,280
don't like how ubuntu looks and feels

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,640
i highly recommend them linux mint which

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,000
is very close to

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,480
ubuntu but it strips away ubuntu's um

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,760
kind of canonical inspired uh

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,240
semi-proprietary ui and then gives you a

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
more

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,920
uh open source feeling ui with all the

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,400
power of ubuntu

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,079
linux mint so you really can't go wrong

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,040
with any of those three

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,640
um i have kind of a preference or an

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,320
overall bias for centos

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
in general uh just because their their

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,359
focus for a long time has been on

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,560
security and multi-tenant security and

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
really enterprise features and

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,280
functionality

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,200
um so i guess if i were making the

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,040
decision for you i probably would go

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,320
with centos stream

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,240
i hope that answers your question um

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,880
okay uh so uh you're familiar you know

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
things that you're

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,839
that you're looking for as a developer

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,040
are here on linux for you as well check

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,839
my time really quick

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,200
um good i think we're all right uh so

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,960
you know things like eclipse for

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
instance intellij

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,119
uh editors like sublime text classic

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,400
command line editors like vm emacs these

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
are all available to you

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,160
and with linux package management

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,800
it's actually easier to install this

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,119
software

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
on linux than it is on other operating

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,359
systems other operating systems are

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
catching up

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,440
right if you're on a mac you might be

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,520
familiar with brew or the homebrew

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,200
ecosystem that's a nice way to install

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
free software on the command line from

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,359
mac

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,800
that's just catching up to the way that

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,680
we have been installing software on

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
linux forever

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,800
which is just using command line package

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,119
management tools to go grab

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,839
free software and install it i mean

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,960
again

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,480
pretty much everything that gets

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,760
installed into a linux environment

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
through the package manager if you

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,119
haven't installed

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,599
special repositories or anything is

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,280
freely redistributable software

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,200
right so you don't you don't really have

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,960
to do anything to put it on your machine

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,640
you don't have to run an installer

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,480
you don't have to agree to a license in

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,880
a lot of cases you can just

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
one line apt-get install sublime and you

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,079
get sublime text right from into ubuntu

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,359
right or

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,800
yum install you know net tools and

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,800
you'll have all your network utilities

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,880
inside of centos right

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,480
so very easy to install the software if

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,880
you're looking for a similar experience

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,119
before you jump though check out

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
chocolaty if you're a linux a windows

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,480
user the chocolaty

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
package manager is going to give you

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,640
kind of a similar experience to being

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,280
able to install free software on windows

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,359
it's

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,800
nowhere near uh as prolific as you'll

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,079
see with um

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,000
things like yum and and app on linux but

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,079
it does kind of give you a similar

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
software installation experience if you

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,839
will

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,960
um on your first install generally the

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,560
installation media is going to be

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,560
provided for you in the form of some

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,240
type of bootable iso file

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,240
you're going to be able to configure

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,839
your system and your network

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
sometimes you'll be able to choose a

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,520
theme for your pre-installed

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,560
software like for instance centos allows

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,000
you to kind of pick

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,400
the type of environment that you want to

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,160
build um and then from there you can use

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,440
a preferred package manager to install

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,440
software or whatever what you want to

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,200
want build some source if you need to

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,960
so here's a picture of installing like

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,920
the centos 7 operating system and you

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,440
can kind of see

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,960
you know this isn't scary on the left

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,599
we're you know we're saying we want to

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,040
gnome is is one of our gui environments

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,359
it's a top level

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,880
open source project another one kde here

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,079
these are our gui environments but we

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
can just choose which one we want to

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,760
pull down and install

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,520
again these are both completely free

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,960
available through public repositories

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,240
and during the install

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,760
it's just going to either copy them off

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,200
a cd or it's going to just download them

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,720
from public repositories and set

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
everything up

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,480
maybe i want to have office suite and

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,320
productivity tools

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,000
as well as some internet applications on

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,280
here

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,480
i want to have compatibility with older

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,920
x windows or older linux uh gui stuff

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,680
right so i can just choose stuff i could

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,400
create a basic development environment

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,359
here

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,720
um and and this this and so this is

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,000
again you know a way to kind of pick a

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,839
theme because

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,599
because all the software is free sitting

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,359
in public repositories

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,599
it can be easily curated um into uh

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,359
easily curated into a whole operating

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,680
system uh so it looks i've got some

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,480
stuff

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,359
showing up in q a here too um dot net

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,160
core on linux

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,800
it's getting better i'll say that uh

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,720
it's uh

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,640
net 5 is actually pretty impressive the

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,280
stuff that i've been able to see run so

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,359
far

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,480
and it's pretty clear that windows is

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,319
making this a

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,240
priority right microsoft is making this

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,520
a priority um so

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,280
you know first i think it was a little

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,680
shaky um

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,400
it's it's really uh really getting

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,400
better um

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,240
used to play with fedora still fairly

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
new back then

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,040
what is the best linux system to get

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,040
started with right now i've heard ubuntu

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,560
is good ubuntu is great but uh i also

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,319
really like linux mint

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,839
uh and then on the other side of that if

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,800
you really want to do something that's

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,560
gonna set you up for

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,400
enterprise class work um centos

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,000
centos linux uh and then what was the

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
name of the raspberry pi wall board

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,160
you're using yo deck

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,760
y o deck yo deck yeah just go to

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,760
yodek.com and it's a

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,599
it is commercial past a single single

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,119
user license uh but it's all based on

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,160
free software

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,520
but the one wallboard totally free and

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,480
it is pretty cool actually i think

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
you'll like it there's a whole

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,079
cloud-based uh

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,440
interface for configuring it uh it's

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,200
pretty cool

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,480
all right well let's keep going we're

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,400
only got a few more minutes uh

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,000
gui options here so this is you know

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,680
gnome so we saw a gnome in the last

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,240
slide this is what actually looks like

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,839
and it's inspired by mac osx right so if

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,400
you're familiar kind of with mac

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,520
os x uh you know there's some there is

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
some stuff here that's gonna look

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,880
familiar to you

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
um there's plugins like a doc and

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,200
everything

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,960
um this is kde which is more kind of

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,560
inspired by windows so more of a start

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,160
menu field specifically this is kde

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,119
running in centos

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,000
right and you really do want to embrace

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,040
the show

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,119
okay um maybe not on day one

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,119
but you do want to get comfortable with

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,400
the show because you're just going to be

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,680
more productive

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
uh you're going to be better at

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,040
administer administering linux on cloud

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,319
you're going to have an easier time um

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,319
navigating between

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,160
like maybe a local linux environment or

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,280
even like on-prem server environments

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
for your business

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,400
and then cloud environments right you

00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,440
really just want to get comfortable with

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,960
that

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,200
uh in linux everything is a file and

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,160
although it may vary a little bit from

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,480
this

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,920
this is going to be the basic overview

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,839
of how the file system looks you're

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,359
going to have a bin directory where

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,280
what we call our systems essential

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,319
binaries may have user bin and things

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,760
like that too

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,240
but this is where we're going to run the

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,359
software out of right

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,480
etc is our configuration

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,960
right so most of our system config is

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,880
going to live

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,079
somewhere inside of this etc if you want

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,560
to go and modify

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,280
parts of the environment networking

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,760
storage

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,880
things like that um startup scripts all

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
that

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,680
that's going to be living somewhere in

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,760
the ctc environment you'll need to have

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,400
elevated privileges in order to modify

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
it

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,319
um you know var variable data files if

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
you're putting a web server on this

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,720
thing

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,560
generally the web server lives in bar

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,599
www

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,079
um so uh again uh go back and review

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,920
this

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,480
i want to say though that the fact that

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,440
everything is a file in linux literally

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,640
everything

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,240
you know means that when uh applications

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,119
want to communicate over a network or

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
communicate with

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,640
with hardware or other processes in the

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,040
environment they do so by interacting

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,359
with these files

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,720
that allows us to uh to have things like

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,880
docker which set up

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,000
fake or shredded environments for these

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,520
things

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,640
um i'd say kind of go out and play um

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,280
just a couple of uh a couple of tools

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,640
here

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,079
um yeah i know those screenshots are a

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,040
little old yeah i need to update this

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
again it's a couple year old

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,240
presentation

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,240
um so uh enterprise hardware vendors can

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,680
build and develop on linux

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,359
sometimes consumer hardware can still be

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,520
a little bit inconsistent you might have

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,520
to wrestle with your laptop a little bit

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,119
the grub bootloader is generally what

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,880
you're going to be

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,400
interacting with if you want to dual

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,319
boot between windows and linux

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,760
refined is a nice utility that allows

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,359
you to boot linux on mac hardware or

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,640
even older mac hardware i see some other

00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,359
questions i just want to power through

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,760
these last

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,480
few slides and we'll see if we have time

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,319
um

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,599
this is actually linux running inside of

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,880
a vm uh

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,079
so you can see here mac osx running and

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,800
then inside it

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,960
we have um i think this is actually

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,119
vmware fusion

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,240
and so vmware in here you're running

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,319
linux mint now

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,839
inside of a vm inside of mac so if you

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,640
don't want to make the full commitment

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,319
and install it

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,319
directly on the hardware you can run it

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,880
as a vm

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,560
you can run it inside of a container

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,760
ventoy is very cool

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,160
this is pretty new universal iso

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,160
booter it's really useful you can go and

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,000
burn this onto the usb drive

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,160
and then you can just copy isos right

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,640
into a folder and boot them directly

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,640
uh linux live legally usb creator also

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,119
very nice for uh quickly getting started

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,839
with it

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,560
raspberry pi i mentioned this a few

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,960
times um

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,040
35 box gets you everything you need for

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,440
a full linux desktop environment

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,280
a really great way to get started and

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,640
then feel free to reach out to me too uh

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,560
if you have any questions out today i

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,200
know we didn't get to everything

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
let me see uh 10-year laptop barely runs

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,000
windows 10.

00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,079
installing ubuntu or something else

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,119
linux mint put linux mint on that it's

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,079
going to run great

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,319
um security concerns linux flavors

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,960
there's always security concerns

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,720
um but you know i think uh and there's

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
malware on every platform

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,880
um but with linux you at least have some

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,280
safeguards like s and linux and whatnot

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,200
that

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,400
minimize the damage can be that can be

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,640
done to an environment

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,079
okay uh i think we're right at the 3-3

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,359
to mark i think i actually get all the

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,119
questions so thanks again for all that

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,839
participation that really helps

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,359
i appreciate the feedback i i hope to

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,040
see you all in person uh

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,640
in a year or so when uh the next time

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,160
that we do this event uh thanks again

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:54,480
for the time feel free to reach out

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:54,480
