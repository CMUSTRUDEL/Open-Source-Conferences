Description: 
	Jennifer Wadella, Director of Angular Development at Bitovi, delivered the talk "10 Commandments of Community Organizing (extended version)" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Welcome to the advanced class on community organizing. You’ve got a decent amount of members in your Meetup.com group, you hold events fairly routinely, maybe you’ve pulled in some legit speakers at your last conference or event … and you want to do more. This talk will focus on community organizing for growth and longevity by building out teams, improving communications, implementing processes, and most importantly will discuss how to maintain sanity in your work-life-volunteer balance. If you’ve ever had to answer the question “Oh, this ISN’T your full-time job???” – this talk is definitely for you. If you’re just starting out organizing and don’t want to fall flat on your face, this talk will be very pragmatic for you.

we're gonna be talking about the ten

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
commandments of community organizing

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,960
um so i know some of y'all might have

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
been in the keynote some of y'all might

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
have not so i'll try and make sure that

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
uh i cover all the content but keep

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,840
things fresh and keep you all

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
entertained

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
um i want to say thanks again for all

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,599
our sponsors um

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
you know a lot goes into planning

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
conferences and in organizing

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
communities and a lot of the

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
reason we can do that is because um

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
sponsors and different tech companies

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
uh give the financial support that

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,600
allows that to happen so

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
um be sure to thank them uh check them

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
out in the

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
uh i think there's like a booth area

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
that you can actually go and click into

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,239
the sponsors and

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
win prizes and stuff like that so thank

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
you sponsors

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,199

um by day i'm the director of angular

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,320
development and a consulting company

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
called betovi um

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
many many years ago i founded a

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,879
nonprofit called kansas city women in

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,360
technology and when we're not in a

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,920
pandemic i'm an international speaker

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,560
um in a pandemic i'm an international

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
speaker

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
that never leaves my house i know we've

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,119
got kind of a lot of attendees from all

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,200
over the world here

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,200
uh and then i spend a lot of time

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
kombucha brewing and taking care of

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
plants that's

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,200
plant plant lady craziness has become

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
one of my

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,479
pandemic hobbies all right

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
um so i'd like to give a little

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
background about some of the programs

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
i've launched so

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
about eight years ago i launched a

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,759
non-profit called kansas city women in

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
technology to try to get more women into

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
tech careers in kansas city

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
um and one of the interesting things

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,560
that was happening when i launched that

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
organization was just

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
uh my eyes were kind of open to a lot of

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
the needs of the community uh when i

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
launched casey wit

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
i just wanted to find more women like me

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
like as a female software engineer

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
um you know the dudes i worked with were

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
all great um

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
but definitely felt very isolated and so

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
i kind of set out and i was like yeah

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,399
i'm gonna have all these cool like

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
female software developer friends

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,520
and that's totally not what happened um

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
what happened was

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
anybody wanting to break into tech or

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
educators wanting to bring tech to their

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,599
classrooms kind of started to reach out

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
and say hey like we're having this

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
problem can you do this can you do this

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
can you do this

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,879
um and so by kind of hearing that

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
feedback and in curating all this

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,200
feedback that i was hearing from the

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
needs of the community we

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
launched a bunch of programs the first

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
one was coder dojo kansas city code or

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
dojo is a global nonprofit based out of

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
ireland

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,000
uh that you can just go to coderdojo.com

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
or dot org i think

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and you can you know go and start your

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,599
own chapter however you want

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
to um ours is shut down on hiatus um

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
we're waiting until we came back get

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
back to in-person events um but really

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
easy to do from there

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
um we've launched a lot of other

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
programs that are more um women

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
identifying specific so coding and

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
cupcakes is a program um

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
to encourage girls to get into

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,000
technology uh one of the really

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
interesting things that happened when we

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
were promoting coder dojo is

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,680
um we would have like a lot of parents

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
and like the programmer dance would

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
always like run up to the booth and be

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
like oh man i can't wait to sign my kids

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
up

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
uh but a lot of times what we would hear

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,319
from mom from moms is they'd say

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,440
something along the lines of oh a coding

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
club

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
i'll bring my son i don't think my

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,680
daughter would like that so the parents

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
were automatically

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
pre-empting their daughters out of like

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
exploring technology just in like a fun

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
coding club

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
um so what do we do we make it pink we

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,599
make it girly and oh all of a sudden

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
coding's okay for girls which i'm

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
being very facetious here in

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
tongue-in-cheek

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
um that color has nothing to do with it

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,400
except for the fact that we're fighting

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,239
what like

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,319
70 years of gender-based marketing and

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
so sometimes we have to flip the script

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
um to make sure that we're getting

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
outreach to communities but anyway i

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,040
digress

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
um so this is kind of the trajectory of

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
the different programs and organizations

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
we launched that we would hear needs of

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,360
the community we would respond we would

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,360
look and assess and say hey

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
can we as an organization somehow

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
respond to and solve this problem

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
um there are a lot of times that people

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
reached out to us and there were simply

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
needs that we could not fulfill

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
um so we've kind of stuck to our core

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
coding education programs and creating

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,120
very welcoming very inviting inclusive

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
events that we continue to

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
improve and iterate on so that's a

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
little bit about my background knowledge

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,519
and kind of where

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
this content that i'm presenting to

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,920
y'all comes from

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
all right um so we talked about this a

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
lot in the keynotes if you were

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
there for the sessions but why do

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
communities matter um these are our

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
number one way in the tech industry

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
right now to do workforce development

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,400
and training

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
um i'm not gonna lie y'all like i've

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
been trying to hire for my angular team

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
for the last year

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,400
and it's terrifying the state of the

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
industry

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
um and i in a i'm very cautious of my

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,080
interviews i never want anybody to feel

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
like they're not good enough or not

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,440
qualified but i have a lot of people

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
that will come to me thinking they are

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
senior angular developers at their

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
company and yes at their company

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
they are the go-to person but when i

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
start to ask some of my basic

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
questions to kind of get a sense of

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
where they fall in the knowledge

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
spectrum of what i would need for one of

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,759
my senior angular consultants

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,520
they are barely scratching the tip of

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
the iceberg on the depth of knowledge

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,120
needed

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
and so we as an industry are not doing a

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
good enough job

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
at the university level at the boot camp

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
level or even internally at our

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,039
in our company level of training up the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
workforce we need um

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,800
so creating communities creating meetups

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
creating conferences is literally our

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
best

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
way to train our workforce right now

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
which is crazy

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
um but you know communities are the

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
backbone of that we're the ones who are

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,199
putting out this content engaging with

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
speakers becoming speakers

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
um and so like communities are are great

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
because they are

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
how we're going to keep progressing our

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
industry forward

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
they allow us the opportunity for

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
networking getting to know their people

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
getting to hear about other things

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
um you know not everybody had the idea

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
of agile development all on their own

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,680
right like you hear about these concepts

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,840
um

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
like jeff was talking about his keynote

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,800
you hear about failures and so through

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
networking you can learn from the

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
experiences of others and incorporate

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,560
those and make your pathway forward

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
um communities also give you growth

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
opportunities um to find out

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,479
what how you don't know what you don't

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
know so there may be things or concepts

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,639
that you've never heard of before

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
and the you know the communities in the

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,360
events that we provide are great ways to

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
access those

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
and then i talk about maslow's hierarchy

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
if you're not familiar it's kind of this

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
um

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,319
this triangle diagram that's been uh

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,479
drawn

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
of what humans need to feel fulfilled or

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
feel actualized and at the very top of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
massless hierarchy is this idea of love

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,240
and belonging and self-actualization and

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,759
so that's being a part of community who

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
understands and can relate to what you

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,759
do and you can get a feel um

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
a feeling of accomplishment for that i

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,240
remember one of my first developer jobs

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
i was the only in-house developer um

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,520
and these were back in the ie days so

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,800
like dark times y'all when i was dealing

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,039
with a lot of css

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
and i would fix this css bug in ie and i

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
would be really excited and i'd like

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
want to celebrate that

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
but none of my co-workers they were all

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
client managers right they didn't write

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,199
code so they had no idea

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
what accomplishment i had actually made

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,599
or had happen

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
and so i was missing the sense of sex

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,680
self-actualization

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,680
because like i didn't have anything to

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
gauge myself against

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,599
to understand my progress and so

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
communities are a really great way to

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
provide us that

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
and community organizers are unsung

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
heroes so if any all are here

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,319
our community organizers this content is

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
for you feel free to ask me any

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,880
questions or share any struggles or

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,000
anything like that um because people

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
just forget how much

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,319
volunteer work goes into communities

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
into maintaining open source or

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,039
projects and all sorts of things um so

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
really key to remember

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,319
all right so um when i talk about the

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
ten commandments um these were

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
uh rules uh according to um the the

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,039
christian bible

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,080
uh to basically that people should live

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,680
by and um

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,120
they're cut they were broken out in in

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
the bible onto two different tablets

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
where three

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,319
commandments the most important three

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
commandments that were on the first

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,280
tablet and then the last

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
the last seven were on the other one um

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
and it's kind of the same thing here

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
like i have ten commandments but three

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,440
of these are like three of those are the

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,639
those are the ones you really really

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
wanna um sink into

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
uh so we're gonna go and jump right into

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
our first commandment which is thou

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,080
shall practice self-care

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,599
um so i talked about this uh during the

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
keynote but your time is your most

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,440
valuable asset um and

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
the thing with running a community or

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,199
running an open source project is it's

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,240
your baby like you have passion

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,400
that is driving you and it can be really

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
easy to get stuck up on by burnout

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,280
before you even realize what's happening

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
because it's your passion right

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
like you're the one hearing feedback and

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
coming up with the ideas and driving

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
things forward

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
and so burnout can be really really

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
sneaky and all of a sudden

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
you are just completely fried you don't

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,560
have the energy that you used to do

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
and so it's really important to be

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
cognizant of this as an organizer or an

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,680
open source maintainer

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,000
and just be kind of doing constant

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,880
check-ins check check-ins with yourself

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
so you can

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
say hey i'm feeling a little bit fried

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
right now i might need to step back

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
reassess my commitments here and figure

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,800
out what i need to do to balance my load

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
so a big part of this is understanding

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
how to take on small tasks and

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,120
improvements

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,720
regardless of if you're running a an

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
event if you're running a conference if

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
you're running an open source project

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,279
there's going to be a lot of feedback

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,640
and you'll have a lot of area to grow

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
especially if you're doing this part

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
time

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
so one of the best ways to set yourself

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
up for success is kind of break

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
everything down that you need to do

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,720
into small executable tasks even better

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
if those are tasks that you can

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
delegate out to other people give

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
yourself office hours

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
this was really helpful for when i was

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
more engaged in running my nonprofit

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
full

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,839
full time because i was fielding a lot

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
of emails and so what i would do is i'd

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,560
have like kind of set hours in my

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
morning like maybe seven to

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
eight thirty a.m before my work day

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
really started those would be my office

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
hours for dealing with all my case do it

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
stuff

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
hit that time of the time clock anything

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,320
i didn't get to got snoozed until later

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
on that day

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
and that way i could have interrupted

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,760
uninterrupted work time um as software

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,120
engineers we know how important it is to

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
to guard our time and make sure that we

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,080
have focus time and you can't do that if

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,519
you're responding to emails so giving

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,959
yourselves office hours to kind of

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,160
bucket your work in is really

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,760
key again a lot of your strategy should

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
be dedicated to guarding your time

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,080
carefully because it is

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,720
your biggest asset it's also worth

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,959
knowing that no is a complete sentence

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
when you are running an event or you're

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,240
building an open source project there's

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
this there's a sense of servitude right

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,959
like you

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,240
you're building this thing to help other

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,000
people um

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
and so it can be really easy to take on

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
the weight of their problems on your

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,480
shoulders

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,079
um so it's good to know that no is a

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
complete sentence you do not have to

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
justify why you don't have the time you

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,880
don't have to justify

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
um so just be aware of that i'm going to

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
talk a little bit more about

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
communication and managing expectations

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
but just a reminder for when it comes to

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
protecting yourself and guarding your

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
time

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,640
no is a complete sentence um

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,240
i also like to uh share with everybody

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
what i call jennifer's first law because

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
this is something that has proved time

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
true time and time again a person's

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
incompetence and email is directly

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
proportional to the likelihood that they

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,240
will massively waste your time

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
um so if i have ever had an organization

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
reach out to me and they wanted to maybe

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
partner with my organization or do

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
something like that if they could not

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
clearly convey

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,000
what they needed or what that would look

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,640
like

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
we would get five or six email email you

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
know exchanges

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
in and it if there was no resolution if

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
i still couldn't get them to communicate

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
to me in a reasonable manner like how

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
they wanted to partner it ended up being

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
a complete waste of my time and things

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
typically did not get better

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,720
um and when you were focusing on

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
prioritizing your time and figuring out

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
where you can spend your time

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,959
to add the most value to your project

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
it's okay to be discerning and say hey

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
this isn't going to be

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
a good use of my time because this

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,680
person doesn't have their together

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,360
um this comes into defining your

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
personal scope and being really guarded

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,640
to not go outside it

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,399
figure out what your commitment level is

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,320
figure out what you can take on

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
have that clearly defined and then use

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
that as a boundary

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
um if that means not doing project stuff

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
on weekends if that means you know hey

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
you've got it you're up against a

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
deadline at work and you need to let

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
everybody know in your community or your

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
open source project that you need to

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
push the pause button for work

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
um you know these are things to think

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
about and consider and and get good at

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
enforcing boundaries around

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
i also really encourage you to find a

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
task tracking system that works for you

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,920
because even if you're segmenting your

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
time even if you are

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
you know using office hours there are

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
things that are going to come in that

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
are going to pull your focus

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
and the the better you have a system

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
where you can say hey this is important

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,519
i can't handle

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
it right now let me drop it into this

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
bucket so it's there for when i get back

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
to it that can be really good

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
um for me personally i tend to utilize

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
um trello or my my google calendar

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
heavily but when i'm starting to really

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,519
pile up and have a lot of anxiety

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,959
writing out a physical to-do list

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,639
is something that tends to be very

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,399
cathartic for me and

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,000
get me in a better headspace out of this

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
anxiety of oh my gosh i have all this

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
overwhelming thing

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,560
all these overwhelming tasks to work on

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
um

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
a big part of this is learning to own

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
your calendar because if you've ever

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
been in a situation where you're

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
managing multiple calendars between your

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
work calendar and something else

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,800
um the more tools and automation you

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,639
have the less time you can

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
have to dedicate to having to manage

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,360
that or deal with conflicting meetings

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,040
or anything like that

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,040
um one of the things that i discovered a

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,079
couple years into my nonprofit journey

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,360
uh was calendly and so calumly is a

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
really great tool that will integrate

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,120
with any calendars you provide it

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
show open meeting times and allow people

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
to schedule you for those meeting times

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,000
so for instance if somebody wanted to

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,720
interview me for something regarding my

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
nonprofit

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,680
i would tell them to go to my calendar

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
link it would be synced with my office

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
calendar

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,680
and then i could set buffer so like

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
improve covet times for instance i

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
wouldn't let anybody book me two hours

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
in advance so i wouldn't have to worry

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
about like driving or traffic or

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
anything like

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
that you can set buffers to have like 15

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
minutes between meetings if you're

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
driving to different coffee shops or

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,760
something like that

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,200
um so callumly is a really really great

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
tool that will allow

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,959
people to have autonomy over your

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
calendar so you don't have to do this

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,120
back and forth email chain

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,040
um but allows you to put like bumper

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
rails in place to protect your time as

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,560
needed

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,160
all right um i mentioned this in my

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,920
keynote but you become as a community

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
organizer or an open source maintainer

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
you become the face of that thing you

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
are the lightning rod you are the

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,040
mockingjay

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
um and so that means any criticism like

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,320
you know any good commentary any

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,760
criticism is going to come your way and

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,399
so one of the most important things that

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
you can do

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
as an organizer is learn how to field

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,639
this criticism

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
because a lot of it is going to be off

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,519
the cuff and a lot of it is not going to

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,760
be given to you

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,680
in the context of them understanding

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,279
your workload and everything going on in

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,600
your life

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
so you have to learn to decipher it and

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
especially if you're a new organizer a

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,920
newer project maintainer it is really

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
hard

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,600
to not take criticism of this thing that

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,360
you're building as a criticism of

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,040
yourself because it is an extension of

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
you right it's your brain you've created

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
it

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,480
um but the more you can separate that um

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
the more successful you're going to be

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,240
in being able to parse through this

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,480
feedback and figure out what matters

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,480
um i like this quote a lot uh take

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,760
criticism seriously but not personally

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
if there's truth or merit to the

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,680
criticism try to learn from it otherwise

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,399
let it roll right off you

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
um i remember when when the casey whit

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
team was scaling and growing i think the

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
largest we've ever had on our leadership

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
team at one time is 60 people so that's

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
like 60 people i'm managing

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
there was a leader who had come on board

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
and it was

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
so clear that she was dropping balls and

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
it was affecting other people

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,959
um and you know it was very hard she

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,720
wasn't very responsive to communication

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
she was no calling no showing meetings

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
and then if she would miss information

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,800
in those meetings she would get really

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
really upset and get really

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,800
nasty and passive-aggressive and slack

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
and i remember that there was one time

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,360
that it was

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
the middle of our monthly board meeting

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
and she decided to email the entire

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,560
leadership team

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,399
um basically with a four paragraph email

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
about what a shitty human being i was

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,519
and what a terrible feminist i was

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
and why she can't be a part of the

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,959
organization because i was such a shitty

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
human being

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
and so um it was kind of like

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
everybody's like all the oxygen got

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,079
sucked out of the room while everybody's

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
like kind of reading this email uh mid

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
meeting

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
and you know there was obviously it's

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,320
sung a lot because anytime you're

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,680
getting some sort of attack like that

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
it's it's hard um to digest but one of

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
the things that i was able to do after

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
you know sitting with it for a couple

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,519
days is be able to interpret and say

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
hey a lot of this is her blowing off

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,240
steam because

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,839
she was realizing that people were real

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
were catching on to the fact that she

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,079
wasn't doing her job and it was gonna

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,839
come and turn onto her and so i was able

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,440
to you know say okay part of this is

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
just her covering her ass or pointing

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
fingers right

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
but there are things that i can learn

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
from this email to how i did better

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
um like could i have provided her more

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,959
communication opportunities to

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,120
communicate her concerns to me

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,720
um what can i do what can i learn what

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
can i take away

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
to figure out how to parse that

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,480
information um and then i see there's a

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,480
question kind of related right now in

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
the q a about what's the best way to

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
deal with trolls and bots

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
and i'll kind of talk about that in a

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
little bit when we talk about managing

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
expectations because that is a common

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,079
occurrence

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
and yeah that's something you will

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,040
definitely deal with

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,360
um so while we're finishing out this

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
section on um

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
you know protecting yourself

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,399
prioritizing self-care um building your

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
network is key find other people who are

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,199
community leaders you want to give

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,639
yourself people to talk through problems

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
and talk through ideas with

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,600
if you can find a mentor in the

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,880
community that's great um and then one

00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
of the other things is you can also

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
mentor

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,399
other budding community meter mentors

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
like um

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,880
community leader make sure you're

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
bringing people together to kind of be

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,919
discussing these things that happen

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
and learn to delegate um we started

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,120
running a django girls event many years

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
ago and one of the best things that i

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,919
ever did

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,760
was i kind of bootstrapped the the event

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
myself the first year and then i

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
portioned out all the tasks that i

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,280
needed to that needed to

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,799
get done to make this event successful

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,559
and i kind of wrote up job descriptions

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,880
for that and we built out a team

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,400
and i think just by doing this we

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
doubled the number of applicants we got

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,640
to attend the workshop we doubled the

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
number of

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
mentors we got involved we doubled the

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
number of sponsors and the event the

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,160
better we got at delegating and building

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,160
a team the more exponentially it grew so

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
i cannot understate the importance of

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
one of the best things that you can do

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
to set your personal project up for

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
success is

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
figure out how to grow a team of

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,559
invested volunteers

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
all right that shall become an expert

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,280
communicator

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,760
um main idea here is don't assume that

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,760
people are

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,520
in enter into your organization or your

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,360
project as you are you know everything

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,960
that's going on but they don't and so

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
you need to be really cognizant about

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
making sure that you're communicating

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
things out

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
um you need to choose this communication

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
format based on your recipients

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
i know slack or kind of these

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,760
asynchronous chat

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
channels have really taken over and

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,960
these are great tools to have

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
conversations if everybody is online at

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
the same time and available

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
if there's a quick question and answer

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
you need to get something answered right

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
away slack can be good for that

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
um or just like random bullshitting or

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,200
like sharing funny stories or memes or

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,200
whatever that's fine

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,039
um but i see people using slack a lot of

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
times when they should when it comes to

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,039
you know community organizing project

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,799
management anything like that

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,320
um so relaying anything important to

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,679
everybody should not be in slack because

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
once it goes past that fold

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,919
it goes to narnia it no longer exists

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,080
y'all like nobody is gonna find it again

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,919
um so you need to have a way to

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,280
communicate important organization-wide

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
information that's not gonna be lost

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
past the fold

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
um this is not a good place to give

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
feedback this is not a place to

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
a good place to handle feedback there's

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,640
a lot that we can lose

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,400
just through text that can just cause a

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
lot of problems and a lot of heartache

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
this is also not a great facility for

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
group brainstorming and decision making

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
because again if everybody isn't present

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,520
and available

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,919
a lot of things can happen that'll be

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,160
really really problematic

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,160
um one of the things you could do is

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
make things easy for people to

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
consume by using lists and calling out

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,799
important information

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
um i've had a lot of success with date

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,840
formatting because a lot of us are

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
either operating against you know

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,039
some sort of schedule some sort of event

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,039
planning schedule

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,640
um or maybe feature release or something

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
like that so the more you can format

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
your information to stick in people's

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,559
brains the better right

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
like we as humans are going to

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
automatically try and parse information

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
so instead of

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
sending like a paragraph along word

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
vomited people be thoughtful and

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
cognizant about the way you're conveying

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
information list out important details

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,520
if there is a cta

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,039
handle that date formatting i really

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
like saying the date of the week

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,240
the day and the time zone i feel like

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
that helps lock people in better because

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
they'll be like oh

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
oh tuesday the 30th i have that keynote

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
versus if i'm just like oh i have a

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
keynote on the 30th

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
where does that fall in my week so by

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
adding that day

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,000
you're giving people a little bit of um

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
an extra cognitive boost to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,039
maintain the information that you need

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,360
them to

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,880
um and by my nonprofit i used to send

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
out an email like this monthly that was

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,760
just like a huge big

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,600
picture overview so that way people who

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
are kind of tunnel vision focused on

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
their project could have a good idea or

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,000
understanding of big picture things that

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,480
are going on and be able to chime in

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,080
um key thing here anytime you're trying

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
to get information from people if you

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
want a response from anybody

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
you need to end with a very explicit

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,440
very specific call to action and a date

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,840
hey um i need you to confirm panelists

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,280
by

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,120
x date and so this gives it this makes

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
it easier for people to prioritize in

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,960
their own workload but then you also

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
have a recourse to follow up and say hey

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,240
if you wanted this to happen this was

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,080
the date and the deadline i gave you to

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
get it complete by

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,240
um adapting this communication strategy

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,559
may seem like a lot it's going to take

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,799
more

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,320
time and effort on your part at first

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,679
but this is like doing that

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,200
advanced planning that's going to cause

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,799
all these problems from piling up later

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,360
on so the more you can front load this

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,039
work

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,159
the more chaos and drama that you're

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,600
going to deal with down the line and

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
that's really the goal right is to

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
reduce the amount of work we're doing

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,039
for the same amount of input

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,280
or output excuse me all right that shall

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,600
manage expectations

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,520
um so i joke about this all the time but

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
people are not psychic

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,039
people are not psychic people are not

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
psychic

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,799
um so you need to do the best job you

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
can to communicate

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,120
what you're going to be doing what

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
you're going to be providing how are you

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
going to providing that because people

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,200
are going to make a lot of assumptions

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
without realizing it and they cannot

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,880
possibly know the things that you know

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
they are not psychic

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,520
a lot of times we'll get feedback that's

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,799
something along the lines of well i

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
thought it was going to be this

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
um the better you can set people up for

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,320
your events

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
your delivery your output the better

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
outcome

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
the better the outcome will be in the

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,159
less complaints that you will get

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,520
um so this is a common problem in coding

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,080
if you're doing anything introductory

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
level

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,360
um sometimes a big part of coding is

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
just getting our environment set up

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
right

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,799
and so one of the things that we

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
struggled with early on is attendees

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
joining our events and being like oh

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,039
well i thought it was actually going to

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,960
be coding not doing all the setup work

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,320
not realizing that this is a huge part

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,000
of what we do in an industry right

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,440
anytime you onboard into a new

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,679
environment there's all sorts of

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
onboarding um so the better we've gotten

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,039
it communicating that verbally or kind

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,360
of giving event schedules or things like

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,679
that

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,360
um the more managed people's

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,760
expectations are and we get less

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,480
um irrelevant feedback like this

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,240
um so again uh you may have heard this

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,679
oh you mean my real job people are

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,760
confused by the fact that you're not

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,080
doing this side project full-time um

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
this

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,440
is something that you need to remind

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,960
people of because for some reason they

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,000
think that volunteer organizations

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
aren't restricted to

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,880
the restraints that traditional

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
businesses are which is completely not

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
true

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
um and so it's good to get used to um

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
managing this and reminding people of

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,559
that

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,000
all right and that brings us to this

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,200
section that i'm going to call crazy is

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,559
going to create because you can do the

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
best job in the world communicating you

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,880
can do the best job in the world

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,559
managing expectations

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
and there will be people that will show

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,799
up and find something to about

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,720
they will find some reason to be unhappy

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,000
um and so this is a key thing of dealing

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
with trolls and bots

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
um i know one of the things that i've

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,840
seen happen to a lot of open source

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
communities particularly last year is um

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,640
we saw a lot of tech organizations

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,400
basically putting up black lives matter

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
banners because we wanted to express our

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
support

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,559
of of the black community and understand

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
the implications and especially

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,039
understand the under-representation of

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
the tech community

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,039
and a lot of trolls got really butt hurt

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,120
and kind of pulled the all lives matter

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,960
crap

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,400
a lot of those conversations are not

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
going to be solved overnight and they

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
are going to be a massive waste of your

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
energy time and energy

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,840
like just don't argue with inter idiots

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,440
on the internet they will um beat you

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,600
down with their experience

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,880
um and so one of the things you can do

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
to better protect yourself and your

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,120
organization as an

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,799
as an organizer is um have a good litmus

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
test have a quick way to figure out if

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
something is a troll or

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,240
is a bot and kind of have a do not

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
engage policy with your team um delete

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,200
silently and move on like sometimes it

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
can be really good really validating to

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,919
like

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,520
argue or like you know just rage at that

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,720
person but it's very very rarely

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,880
productive and it's just gonna

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,799
suck your emotional energy um so that's

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
definitely my advice is to just move on

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,919
from from the crazies and and the more

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
experience you get the more you can

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,080
discern between somebody with valid

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
feedback

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,320
and somebody who's having a bad day and

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
wants somebody to take it out on

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,760
on that note it's really important to

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
know your value system um be confident

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,240
in your values and be confident

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,320
upholding them

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
i mentioned the keynote that we really

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
like partnering with other organizations

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,440
um that have similar focus to us so we

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,720
can like bootstrap like existing

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,919
workshops or things they've done help

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
spread their brand and that kind of

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
thing

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,919
that being said we've partnered with

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
organizations in the past that did not

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,480
take a stance on matters that we think

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
were important

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
um it came to the city of women in

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,640
technology we are a women-focused

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,799
organization but we recognize that

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,320
diversity is more than just white women

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,320
um and so this is something that our

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
leadership team is very cognizant of and

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,080
being

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
intersectional feminists and

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
understanding the experiences that don't

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
mimic

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,360
cis white women um and

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,039
you know that's really important to us

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
and we've partnered with organizations

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
that very

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,120
similarly came out with a different

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
stance of oh well we don't think

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
systemic racism is actually a thing and

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,480
when i hear a leader of another

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
organization saying that

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,799
we're gonna make the choice to walk away

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
and be very very clear and say hey y'all

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,159
we don't align here it would not be a

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,679
part of our value system continue

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,679
partnering or working with you

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
um so i would definitely encourage you

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,919
to share your values with your team and

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,159
also be confident upholding them

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,120
um you know if that means you know

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
protecting your

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,080
community which i hope it would or not

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
tolerating harassment or things like

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,600
that take a firm stance on it and

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,679
and keep doing that um this leads into

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,960
having a code of conduct and a process

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,480
it's not enough just to have a code of

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,360
conduct you need to have a way for

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
people to know

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,279
how to report violations and how your

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,880
team is going to handle those reports

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,240
when the time arises

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,919
so spend time crafting your code of

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
conduct a lot of them are open source

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,360
for instance the kansas city moment

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
technology one is open source

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,320
and make sure you have policies in place

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,200
for how to report and enforce it

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,520
communities most must be both inclusive

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
and

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,080
exclusive to serve their members there's

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
this inclusivity piece where you want to

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,720
be aware of different backgrounds that

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
people are coming from

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
but if there are members there are bad

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,720
actors that are

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
engaging in behavior that is harmful to

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
your community to your

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,600
members you must exclude them and that's

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
the bottom line

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,760
um i like the spot quote a lot um you

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,559
know the the needs of the many

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,200
outweigh the needs of the few um and you

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,320
know this is

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,559
something important to think about

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,080
because as a community organizer you

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,840
you don't necessarily like want to play

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,200
god right but to best protect your

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
community you need to be comfortable

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,320
making those decisions of

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,760
removing those bad actors and being

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,360
exclusive to um

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,960
toxic behavior when it's necessary um

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,960
i see a question who determines what the

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
values of an open source project is

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
um probably the maintainers of the

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,480
project um these are conversations that

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,880
we need to get better about having i

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
know

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
there's been kind of this idea in the

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
tech community of oh like tech isn't

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,840
political or anything

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,919
but y'all it is like if we were building

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
technology to be used by everybody that

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
means we need to be aware of different

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,440
backgrounds and different stories

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,400
um so if you're not if you're involved

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,039
with the project you don't know what

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
your values

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,320
their value system is i think it's valid

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
to bring up the conversation be like hey

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
y'all

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,799
like what are our values how are we

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
going to treat people how are we going

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,880
to

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
you know deal with toxic community

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
members how are we going to make sure

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
that we're not reinforcing bad behavior

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,320
all those things need to be a part of

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,399
managing expectations of your project

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,200
and what you're going to do

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,559
all right um that shall not neglect thy

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,039
volunteers

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,399
um do not make your volunteers herd cats

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,960
this is like the biggest thing i hate

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,559
when i've

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,640
you know wanted to contribute my time or

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,000
my energy and like i've walked into an

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,360
event and there's just chaos to the

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
point that i don't even know a way to be

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,000
helpful

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,000
um so one of the best things you can do

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,679
is kind of make things really easy have

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
parking arrival and instructions very

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,880
clear for your volunteers

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,799
don't make them be driving around a

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
giant facility like frantically trying

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,880
to get a hold of somebody on the phone

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,480
because they can't figure out how to

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
park it stressful it's a it's a mood

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
killer

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
have an emergency contact number

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
available caveat here women organizers

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
never list your personal phone number

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,399
you can set up a google voice number for

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,760
free that will route to your phone

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,200
but this is just a way to protect

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,799
yourself i learned this lesson the hard

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,559
way um this is something that we have to

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,039
do differently as women

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,559
um have clear instructions duties and

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,000
responsibilities for your volunteers the

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,520
more you can break down the tasks that

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,960
you might need to have happen

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,480
the easier you can farm those out to

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
volunteers they will be happy because

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
they can be executing on what they need

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
to

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,000
and you'll have your designated chaos

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,600
laid for anything you didn't think of

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
um and then as much as possible keep

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,080
your volunteers out of line of fire for

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,159
criticism

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
um because you know as an organizer

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,200
there are people that are going to be

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,039
pissed off and no matter what

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,039
um when we were running coding classes

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
for kids sometimes the parents would

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
come in with a bit of an attitude and

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,919
there's more than once that i had to lay

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
down

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,960
and be like hey you know what my

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,240
volunteers are volunteering their time

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,679
on a saturday morning

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
if you're not able to respect them and

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,000
communicate respectfully i'm gonna kick

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
you out

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
like that's all it is so one of the best

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,480
things you can do with your volunteers

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,840
is making sure you're

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,840
protecting them from the kind of things

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,360
that can happen um

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,039
big picture plan your events ahead of

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,559
time give your volunteers as much notice

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,159
as you can send calendar reminders

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,200
create calendar invites especially in

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
this zoom land

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,320
where we're all in different time zones

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
one of the best things you can do to

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,240
make sure everybody's on the same page

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,799
is just

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
invite on the calendar it's there unless

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,279
you are sending that calendar

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,120
invite and it's recurring while you're

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,880
in germany and then you wonder

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,399
last week why it's two weeks off because

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,080
they pick up daylight savings time two

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,279
weeks later than yours and

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,640
time zones suck y'all um but you know

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,480
you can do a lot of things to help your

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
volunteers have an easier time

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,159
um also do not forget to feed your

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,720
volunteers i cannot see the number of

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
times

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
like tell you the number of times i've

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
been at like a smaller run conference or

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,279
something like that

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
and i just see like the the attendees

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,919
queue up for the lunch line right like a

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,960
session left out five minutes early and

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,559
they're already in line and you just

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,279
like see the volunteers at the check-in

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
table

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,320
like looking longingly at the food and

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,440
oh no like nobody thought about feeding

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,000
them and still be like all right you two

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,960

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,279
will like walk into somebody else's

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
conference and make sure their

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,760
volunteers are cared for

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,080
um but you know go get in line come back

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
you

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,080
you set the table they go and go next so

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,919
don't forget to feed your volunteers and

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,559
find ways to thank your volunteers

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
solicit their feedback and act on it you

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,799
know it's

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,320
getting their feedback is really really

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,640
valuable but you'll make them feel

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,320
valued by actually acting on it

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,679
offer leadership opportunities figure

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,000
out ways to grow and expand and give

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,200
people

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,279
authority and autonomy in your

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
organization provide nice volunteer

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,399
shirts

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,840
um when we're post pandemic planning

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,200
appreciation knitters and parties is

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,039
really nice especially to like kind of

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,240
decompress after a chaotic event where

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
everybody just wants to drink bourbon

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,200
and chill out

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
um and you know promote their efforts on

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,320
social media if they write a blog post

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
if they do something like that like use

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,000
your platform to help promote them

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,440
um and if the opportunity arises like

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,799
keep them in mind when nominating for

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
like community awards all sorts of

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,559
things like that

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,919
again this is a lot of time and effort

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
on your part but we'll keep your

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,960
volunteers coming back

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
volunteers are the lifeblood of what we

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,960
do is as volunteer organizations and so

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,960
the more you prioritize them and

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
make them feel rewarded the the more

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
they're going to be able to put

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,120
towards your project um and i know

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,720
we started about 10 minutes late um so

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,320
if my moderator can tell me what the

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
game plan is or if i have to just try

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,240
and

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,760
wrap up early um but

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,840
playing as far in advance as calendar

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,279
really possible um it's really easy to

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,480
actually just kind of like say hey for

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,000
the next six months we're going to do

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,440
events we have things scheduled out and

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
then there's not this chaos running up

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,799
and so you can start to fill in gaps

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,519
with speakers and things as you go

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,640
um i want to divert back to mark i think

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,640
had a question about trying to get the

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
members to suggest topics and speakers

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,039
is pulling teeth

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,320
yeah it's a pain in the ass people are

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,679
not going to do it so one of the best

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,960
things that you can do that we've had a

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
lot of success with is

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,559
like schedule out some events have some

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,159
topics in mind and then troll linkedin

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,519
um and honestly like if you're trolling

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,000
based on skill sets this is actually a

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,279
really good

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,960
way to get like make sure you're

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,080
reaching a more diverse audience of

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
people who might not be coming your

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,320
event already

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
um is because you can filter by skill

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,720
sets so you can just reach out and shoot

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
people a message and say hey

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
i notice you're an expert in this we're

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
looking for some speakers on this topic

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,600
or a panel or something like that would

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,120
you be interested in contributing

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
um so that can be a really great way to

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,000
do that um consistency is key the more

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,799
regular you can be with your events um

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,480
whether it's like

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,080
meetings for open source contributors or

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,960
just like actual events that are public

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,320
facing

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
the more regularly scheduled they are

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,279
the more people can plan for account and

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,799
account for them

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,559
it's going to be easier to book speakers

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,720
and volunteers and venues and advance

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,159
this way

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
the other big part here is if you have

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
diversity goals which i hope you do

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,320
make an effort sooner rather than later

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,840
do not be making these last minute like

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,960
panelist requests to like some token

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,399
minority because you're afraid you're

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,919
going to get criticized like you should

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,679
be building your panels building your

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,039
speaker lineups with diversity in mind

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,559
at the beginning not because

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,240
oh you saw somebody dragged on twitter

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,679
and oh like maybe now we better

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
like compensate for that

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,120
um i've got more resources and blog

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,799
posts and things like that on how to

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,240
build diverse inclusive communities but

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,519
the earlier you can focus on this the

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,559
better

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,240
um that shall confirm the venue thrice

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,399
cover your ass cover your ass cover your

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,480
ass um vendors and venues have a lot

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,080
more to focus on than just your event

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,840
um and you're the one who's gonna look

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,279
stupid if something goes wrong so the

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,120
more you can do to make sure you have

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,440
checks in place for this the better

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,120
um it is your responsibility to make

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,240
sure that all the moving pieces are

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,440
there like yeah it might have been

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,720
somebody else's screw up but it's going

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
to be you at the end of the day on the

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,120
line

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
it's also important to be a courteous

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,320
menu guest make sure you're shouting

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,039
them out on social media kind of

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,720
promoting them

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,000
please clean up after yourself ask if

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,039
they need the garbage taken out or

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,720
anything like that

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,080
and here's the big one that i see happen

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,840
at evening meetups all the time is

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,640
they'll be in some sort of office space

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,679
right

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,960
um and like everybody does this thing

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,240
where they're talking the session will

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
end and people are just chit chatting

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
afterwards

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159
and you see the person who's there to

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
like has the case of the building and

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
they're like

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,840
watching your clock and so one of the

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,440
really courteous things you can do as a

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,480
community organizer is to not overstay

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,600
your welcome

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
um and you know if you notice this

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,640
happening be like hey y'all why don't we

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,519
go continue this conversation at the bar

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
down the street

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,800
i mean kind of get used to pushing

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,159
people out when the event ends but have

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,639
a way to facilitate continuing the

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,639
conversations

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,639
all right um that shall arrive at least

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
one hour before starting time

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,000
setup will always take longer than you

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,240
expect something will have been put away

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,079
weird something will be going on um

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,520
there we go um your team or your

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,919
speakers will be late traffic will

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,240
happen

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,359
and your attendees will show up early um

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,639
so the more you can do to

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,399
kind of be prepared for these different

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,240
situations the better

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,679
um i remember one year at a django girls

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,639
event we were having it i think we're

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
going to start at five

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,159
or seven o'clock on a friday and so that

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,679
way our team could wrap up their day

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,399
jobs at five get over to the venue start

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,560
set up

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,000
well a vast majority of our attendees

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,320
just thought they'd try on over

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,320
right after work and so we just had like

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
50 women just sitting in a hallway

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,079
waiting for us to like set up the venue

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
and have um checkout going so

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,119
um the more you can be aware of like

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,040
these things happening and these are

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,960
these are known truths these will happen

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,920
the better you can accommodate

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,359
um that shout test this wi-fi and bring

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,040
any supplies needed

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,720
um especially for your tech event no

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,320
wi-fi or shoddy wi-fi will just

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,640
completely tank your event that's

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,000
that's it's just it's so hard to recover

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,839
from um

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,280
if you have ahead of time um

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,800
if you're able to ahead of time get in

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,400
set up the venue have contact

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
information for people who can retest

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,560
the router

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,760
like i've been at companies before that

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
are like larger and they've got this

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,079
like sis admin with the god clownplex

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,800
who literally

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,920
has the router locked in a closet and if

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
you need to do something with that you

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
need to have this contact information or

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,760
a way to deal with that during your

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,760
event

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,119
um definitely bring all the dongles

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
technically it's on speakers but again

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,160
it's your event on the line so might as

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,079
well be prepared and just like

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
all our organizers have these like clear

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,960
plastic totes we've bought from home

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,160
depot that just have like all the event

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,280
supplies in them and all sorts of

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
different things that we've learned over

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,960
the year

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,400
um all right and thou shall have a

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,680
designated chaos lead

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,920
murphy's law like i mentioned in the

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,320
keynote what can go wrong will go wrong

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
um

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,599
no matter how well you plan for this

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,119
event no matter how many community

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,560
organizing talks you go to or how many

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
horror stories you'll throw from me

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,920
stuff will still go wrong um there are

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
always going to be problems you can't

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
plan for

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,359
and you need to have somebody prepared

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,280
to deal with these on the fly so people

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,640
with dedicated roles or responsibilities

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
or facilitating the event or

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,920
emceeing aren't constantly getting

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
pulled away from their focus have a

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,240
chaos lead

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,240
constant vigilance all right

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
um and finally that shall focus on

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,920
process improvement

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,800
wherever possible um retros are a really

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,720
great way to do this

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,920
after we run big monthly events we have

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
retrospectives where we have our

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
volunteers and our mentors give feedback

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,200
we you know scribe everything like jeff

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
mentioned having ascribe is really

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
important

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,440
and on that note do not automatically

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
designate the woman in your group as a

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,359
scribe

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,200
it's something you may not even realize

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,640
that happens a lot but is definitely

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,240
problematic um talk about what went well

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,079
what didn't go well and what can we do

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,240
better next time these are all great

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,520
questions to start a conversation around

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,520
on that can lead you to have

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,040
really really great events or you know

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,240
feature releases or anything moving

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,760
forward

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,280
any repeat emails you're dealing with

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,560
throw on the fax page especially for

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,240
open source projects

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
um you have people they're like hey how

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
can i help how can i contribute

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,640
the better you have documented an

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,839
onboarding guideline for them the less

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
time you're going to spend with back and

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
forth emails so start to automate those

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
things

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,359
um auto like figure out what your pain

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,880
points are what you spend the most time

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,640
on repetitively and figure out how to

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,240
work on those first

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,599
um check-in process is huge for

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,960
in-person events those are always the

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,119
most chaotic times

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,560
um so spending focus there is really

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,839
really key

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,599
one of the other things you can do is

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,320
automate post to social media wherever

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,560
possible

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,079
i don't know about y'all like i i mostly

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
just post on twitter i'm not a

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,040
marketing executive and so having

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
automation for

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,640
promoting events and things like that is

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,160
really important um the other thing that

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,079
you could really do to set yourself

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
up up for success is begin gathering

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,200
data asap especially if you have plans

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,960
to scale

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,119
or get funding or deal with an open

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,920
source foundation the more data you can

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,119
get about how many users you have what

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,040
your users look like what those

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,640
demographics are

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,000
the better you're going to be set up to

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,480
be able to answer questions go after

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,640
funding go after more support

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,079
so big picture summary 10 commandments

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,240
are here practice self-care

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,280
become an expert communicator manage

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,800
expectations

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
don't neglect your volunteers feed your

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,040
volunteers plan as far as advance as

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,119
possible confirm your venue

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,400
arrive early test the wi-fi have a

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,000
designated chaos lead

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
and focus on process improvement

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,599
wherever possible

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
i've got a couple resources linked here

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,760
again these are going to be available on

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,599
the slide

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
i've got blog posts that go way more in

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,400
depth in a lot of the content that i

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,000
covered today talking about building

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,680
volunteer teams running great events

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,440
building inclusive events

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
and the missing stare is just a must

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
breed for dealing with problematic

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,800
community members

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
um if you have any questions go ahead

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,680
and drop them in the q and a

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,040
now for anything that i have not gotten

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,760
to because i know we're a little over

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,359
time

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,880
um but i'll be floating around you can

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,880
definitely um just tweet at me at like

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,160
omgsfetty on twitter with any questions

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
you might have and i will try and get

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,599
back to you with answers or punt any

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,880
resources i can your way um sorry that

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,160
we lost 10 minutes so i had to kind of

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,680
speed talk through some of this but i

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,520
want to make sure i'm being respectful

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,960
of the speaker after me joining

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,720
um so let's see here can should we put

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,560
the early attendees to work

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,079
yes or no it really depends on the setup

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,160
of your event um a lot of times if

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,640
there's complicated onboarding steps or

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,520
kind of like um environment setup or

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
things like that it can be more

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,200
problematic

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,400
because then you're going to be

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
answering the same question over and

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,280
over and over and over again

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,720
if you're dealing with kiddos one of the

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
things we did at

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,920
coder dojo is we would have some like

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,359
filler activities for the beginning as

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,480
people float in like we would have them

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,800
getting

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,000
typing.io and it's a really cool way to

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
practice like um

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,200
just keep like using your keyboard but

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
you could do it with different

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,680
programming languages and so it was kind

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,119
of cool thing there

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
um so one of the things you could plan

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,480
towards is having something for

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,400
attendees to do but a lot of times

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,359
if you're trying to do training or

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
something like that you're going to

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,400
spend a lot more time repeating the same

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
question versus just having everybody

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,839
wait and kind of chill

00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:04,480
[Music]

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,400
all right i am not seeing any other

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,440
questions um so i'm gonna say let's go

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,359
ahead and rap again

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,520
sorry for the kind of like the the rapid

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,280
um this because i know we got a bit off

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,040
schedule from earlier this morning

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,359
um but these slides are available at 10

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,560
commandments.jenniferwadella.com

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,920
i'm happy to answer any of your

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
questions elsewhere hear about your

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
community organizing horror stories

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,440
i hope this was helpful i hope you can

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,040
learn from some of my mistakes and some

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,960
of my experiences

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:37,200
and have a great rest of your conference
