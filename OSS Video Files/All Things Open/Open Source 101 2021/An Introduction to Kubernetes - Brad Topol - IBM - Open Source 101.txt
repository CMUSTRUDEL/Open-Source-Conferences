Description: 
	Brad Topol, Distinguished Engineer at IBM, delivered the talk "An Introduction to Kubernetes" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Kubernetes is a cloud infrastructure that provides for the deployment and orchestration of containerized applications. Kubernetes has established itself as the de facto platform of choice for the creation of cloud native computing applications. In this talk, we provide an overview of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. We begin with a short introduction to the concept of containers and describe the Kubernetes architecture. We then present several core features provided by Kubernetes such as Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Service objects, and autoscaling capabilities. We conclude with a discussion of Kubernetes continuous delivery fundamentals, including how to do small batch changes, source control, and developer access to production-like environments.
