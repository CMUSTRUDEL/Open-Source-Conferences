Description: 
	Matthew Burke, Software Engineer at Capital One, delivered a talk titled "Adding Scripting to Your Application" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
In this talk, I will discuss the reasons why you might want to add scripting to your application. These reasons include facilitating debugging, tuning, prototyping, extensibility, and flexible configuration. I will then turn to examine some of the options for adding scriptings such as Python, Guile, and Lua.

The majority of the presentation will consist of a simple, how-to demonstration. Here I will present a simple C application, add an embedded Lua interpreter and show how to extend the app with a couple of Lua commands. The emphasis will be on explaining Luaâ€™s embedding API.
