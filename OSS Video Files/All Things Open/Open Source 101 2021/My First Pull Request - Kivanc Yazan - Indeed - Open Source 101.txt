Description: 
	Kivanc Yazan, Software Engineer at Indeed, delivered the talk "My First Pull Request" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
This beginner-friendly talk will introduce the audience to the world of Open Source, git, and pull requests.

A pull request is usually a patch of the test, code, or documentation. It is usually submitted with a description and sometimes comes with a discussion. While many projects prefer using platforms like GitHub and GitLab, some are sharing patches via email.

The talk will include a demo of a pull request being submitted and merged. It will end with pointing users into finding the first project to contribute to.
