Description: 
	Nuritzi Sanchez, Sr. Open Source Program Manager at GitLab, Inc., delivered the talk "Communication Hacks: Strategies for fostering collaboration and dealing with conflict in open source" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
During this talk, you’ll learn about topics like cross-cultural collaboration, giving and receiving feedback, and active listening — all things that are vital to the health of our open source communities.

After reading many self-help books, watching various TED Talks, and listening to a ton of podcasts, I’ve condensed my learnings to help you improve your communications skills, deal with conflict, and collaborate better than ever, not only in FOSS but also everywhere else.
