Description: 
	Nuritzi Sanchez, Sr. Open Source Program Manager at GitLab, Inc., delivered the talk "Communication Hacks: Strategies for fostering collaboration and dealing with conflict in open source" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
During this talk, you’ll learn about topics like cross-cultural collaboration, giving and receiving feedback, and active listening — all things that are vital to the health of our open source communities.

After reading many self-help books, watching various TED Talks, and listening to a ton of podcasts, I’ve condensed my learnings to help you improve your communications skills, deal with conflict, and collaborate better than ever, not only in FOSS but also everywhere else.

awesome thank you so much

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
uh hi everybody i recognize a few names

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,040
on the list of participants so

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,520
welcome back to my speeches uh

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
my name is nurizi sanchez and i am the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
senior open source

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,960
program manager at get lab i have been

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,800
an open source since about 2012.

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,720
um my entry point was just that i helped

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
start a company that created a linux

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,719
based distribution

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,120
called endless created for people with

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,120
little to no internet access

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,239
and i've also been on the board of

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,719
directors at the gnome foundation

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,360
and a lot of what i do revolves around

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,600
having good communication

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
so in this presentation i'm hoping to

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,000
share some of what i've learned

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,680
with you all oops

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
let's go back today what we're going to

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,120
cover

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
are things like navigating cultural

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,840
differences

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,880
improving feedback active listening and

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,560
some of my favorite hacks and if you've

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
been to some of my talks before

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
this is a conversation or this is a

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
topic that i'm trying to give

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
at multiple communities because i think

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,040
it's something that

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,720
is crucial to uh having

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,960
diverse and um

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,320
engaging communities a place where

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
everybody feels comfortable

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,400
participating

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,119
so each time that i give this talk i

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,119
usually

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,280
adopt it a little bit in this

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
presentation i'll be talking a lot more

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
about the feedback section

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,560
for example but first

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,799
i'll go ahead and start off by talking

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,040
about navigating cultural differences

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
and while there are many ways that we

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
can think

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,320
about how about cultural differences

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,040
um i'm going to talk about one by erin

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,079
meyer she wrote a book called the

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
culture map

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
and a lot of her research is on seven

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
indicators

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,640
about how cultures differ

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,160
these seven indicators are communicating

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,000
evaluating leading trusting

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,640
disagreeing scheduling and persuading

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
on the left you see an image of what

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,440
these different

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,599
7 7 indicators are and i'll go

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
through a few of them in order to let

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,280
you know

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,640
how the culture map works

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,360
oh sorry about this presentation isn't

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
working

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,040
all right so the first indicator is

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,440
communicating

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,319
low context cultures care about

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
communication

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,000
that is precise simple and clear

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
they oftentimes use repetition in order

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,480
to avoid misunderstandings

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,800
in contrast high context cultures think

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,560
that good communication is sophisticated

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
and nuanced and layered

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
and oftentimes you have to read between

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
the lines

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
and so here you can see how different

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
cultures

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,760
uh kind of align across these this

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
indicator where low context cultures are

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,720
on the left

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,799
and high context cultures are on the

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
right these are just a few of the many

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,200
countries and cultures that exist

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
but one of the things that i want you to

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
notice

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,440
is that even if two countries share a

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
language

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
so for example the united states and the

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
uk

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
they still might be in different places

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,959
in terms of this

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,280
spectrum of low context to high context

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,879
where the united states for example is

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,440
very low context

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,440
and the uk is more towards the middle

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,959
the next indicator that we'll go over is

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,480
evaluating and this is about how

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,720
cultures give negative feedback

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
direct negative feedback feedback

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,439
cultures

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,920
give feedback frankly honestly bluntly

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,160
they don't use soft they don't use

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
positive messages to soften the negative

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
ones

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
they use absolutes so things like you

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,680
always do this or

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,560
you you know you're always late

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,280
and it's okay to give this negative

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,280
feedback in front of groups

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
on the other hand indirect negative

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,680
feedback cultures

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,320
tend to give negative feedback softly

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
subtly and diplomatically

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
they often use positive messages to wrap

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440
the negative ones

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,520
so if you've heard of the sandwich

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,360
effect where you have a positive

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
message and then a negative and then you

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
follow it by a positive

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
that's what we mean by sandwich and you

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,199
know softening it with

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
positive messaging oftentimes these

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,120
cultures use

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,080
qualifying descriptors so things like

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
you

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,960
sometimes do this a little bit

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
and then oftentimes the feedback is

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,280
given in private

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
here again you can see different

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,919
cultures and where they align

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,720
russia and germany for example are much

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
farther

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,600
along or closer to the negative direct

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,320
negative feedback side

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
and cultures like indonesia india china

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,000
and mexico

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
are closer to indirect negative feedback

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
the next indicator is persuading and

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,880
this is how

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,840
we try to persuade people to act

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
so the first type of culture is

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,720
principles

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,639
first these cultures value the why

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
they have been trained to develop the

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
theory or the concept

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
before presenting the facts the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,759
statements or the opinions

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
on the other hand applications first

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,000
cultures value the how

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,000
or the what first they're trained to

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,039
begin with the facts and the statements

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
or opinions

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,160
and then they back up the conclusion as

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
necessary

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
this is often times where you get things

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,319
like executive summaries or

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
really like what this is about and then

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
you can read more about how we got to

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,199
the conclusion

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and what aaron meyer says in her book is

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,720
that

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
prince somebody from france for example

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,440
might get really frustrated if they have

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
somebody from the united states who

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,319
always tells them to do something and it

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,360
might explain

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
the what they're trying to achieve but

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
unless they hear the why first it's

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,560
frustrating

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,199
and what this means is that there's no

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,080
right or wrong way to approach something

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,160
these are just how different cultures uh

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,360
might are just how society is in

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,240
different cultures

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,080
and so in order to work together better

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
we need to better understand the

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,639
differences

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,960
and uh have empathy for how people do

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
things

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,199
i want to give an example of what a

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,479
culture map

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,199
actually looks like this

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,759
is an example from the 2020 gnome

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,240
foundation board of directors

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
where we have directors from backgrounds

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
from the united kingdom

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,560
united states brazil mexico

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,960
and nigeria and on the right hand side

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,479
you can see an image of what a culture

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,960
map looks like

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,720
it looks kind of like a bunch of lines

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
randomly put together

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
but this is what a culture map looks

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,360
like and if you

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,199
look at the third from the bottom

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,240
the trusting indicator this is about how

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,199
cultures build trust and there are some

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
cultures that are

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,000
task based and some that are

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,039
relationship based

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,720
task-based cultures uh build

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,520
trust by working alongside each other

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
so the more that somebody uh completes

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
tasks

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
the more you start to build that trust

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
and

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,800
um and yeah that's how you build trust

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
in other cultures relationship uh trust

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
building

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,319
is important this means that you want to

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
get to know the person outside of work

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
so going out to lunch might be important

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
and

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
asking about family friends hobbies

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,479
finding

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
other commonalities again outside of

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,519
work

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,640
what aaron meyer says is that trust or

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
task based trust building cultures

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
a lot of times relationships are very

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,200
specific to a particular job

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,880
or in this case a particular open source

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
community for example if you're working

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,440
alongside somebody

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,720
and really and and if somebody moves

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
away from that job or

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
open source uh community they the

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,040
relationship won't be

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,720
as strong versus relationship

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,279
trust building cultures because they

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
have really invested in getting to know

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
each other outside

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
of work a lot of times those

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,200
relationships persist

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,680
beyond just that job opportunity or the

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
open source contribution time that

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,480
they've spent there

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,399
and what this means is that

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
here you can see that the board of

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,279
directors for gnome

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
there is somebody from the united states

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,240
who is very task-based trust building

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,399
and then we have board of directors from

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,880
mexico brazil and nigeria

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
that are more relationship based and

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,680
this means they might want to

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,160
find activities where they not only have

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,560
meetings to get work done but they might

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,440
also want to engage in coffee chats

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,959
or some sort of social activity in order

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
to build that trust

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,399
in order to then work together better so

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
by

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,800
understanding by mapping things out with

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
groups that you work closely with

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
you might develop better understanding

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,839
in order to work

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
better closely together

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,920
some final tips for navigating cultural

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
differences

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,440
or to invest time in getting to know the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
people that you work with

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
especially those that you work most

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,079
closely with

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
not to make assumptions for example

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,360
someone might speak

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,640
and in a certain way that makes you

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
think that they're from a certain

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,120
culture

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
or they might look like they're from a

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
certain culture

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
but they might not identify as part of

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
that culture

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,560
so don't make assumptions and then i

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
think that it's okay to establish

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,800
expectations

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,959
for example the git lab where i work

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
they have a cross-cultural collaboration

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
guide which i've linked to at the bottom

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
of this slide

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
where they talk about different things

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
that

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
get lab tries to do

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
so for example they acknowledge that

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,800
there are both low context cultures

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
and high context cultures and they

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
explain what those are

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,279
and then they say that gitlab tends

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,440
towards low context communication

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
and that helps everybody develop an

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
understanding of what the differences

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
are

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,519
and then also try to tend towards one

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
and that's great i think that we just

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
need to make sure that we're

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,920
understanding those trade-offs for

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
example how it then

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,040
affects our hiring process or

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,320
who were like really

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
the type of community that we're

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,880
fostering all of this kind of stuff

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,200
in order to make sure that people from

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,399
high context cultures for example

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,200
still find a place and that um

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
you know there isn't bias against them

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
so

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,519
uh as long as people understand this

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,160
i think that that you can proceed in a

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
way that

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,000
is culturally sensitive and with all of

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,160
this

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
i think it's really important for

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
empathy to be our guide

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
we'll talk about this a lot but when

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,880
we're

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
collaborating with people don't assume

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,000
and just make sure you take the time to

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,120
try to understand them

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,240
right we're moving on to this improving

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
feedback section

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,839
and the thing that i want to make sure

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,519
everybody comes away with today

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:29,120
is that giving and receiving feedback

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,440
is a skill set that we can all build

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
so if you think that you're that you get

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
defensive

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
when receiving feedback or that you that

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,880
you find

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,240
giving feedback awkward just know that

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,839
it's something that we can

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,839
continue to develop and get better at

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
and in order to do that we first have to

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
be aware of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,760
underlying biases and tendencies because

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,120
we're all affected by our own

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,440
stereotypes and

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,600
just our perceptions of of how we see

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
the world

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,639
and something that's really interesting

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
is that

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,480
feedback is a good thing so even if it's

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,720
difficult it is good

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
and it's actually linked feedback

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
seeking behavior is linked

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,480
to higher job satisfaction to being more

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,600
creative on the job

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,279
and adapting to things more quickly and

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
specifically seeking

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,000
negative feedback is associated with

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,040
higher performance

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,040
so this is a good thing

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
but i want to acknowledge that receiving

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
negative feedback

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,040
is tough and this is because we feel

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160
bad emotions more strongly than we feel

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,279
the good ones

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,560
because our brains are wired to detect

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,720
threats in order to help us arrive

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
so back in the day you know we saw a

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,480
cheetah

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
our fight flight or fight or freeze

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
instinct would kick in

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
and we would and and that's how we

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,519
reacted

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,839
and similarly we see we often see

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,839
negative feedback as a threat and that

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,000
same

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,160
instinct of fight flight or freeze kicks

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
in

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
so here are some tips for how to get

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,199
better

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,240
at receiving negative feedback

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,720
the first one is that it's okay

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
to take some time and in fact we should

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
try to

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,199
incorporate this as a regular practice

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,120
to make

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,839
time between when we receive the

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,560
feedback and when we respond to the

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,920
feedback

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,959
and if that seems difficult don't worry

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,240
it's not just difficult for you um and

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,040
one way to help with that of like

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
making it an a regular practice to build

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
in time

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,839
is to create a script to help you do

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
that

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,240
so something like thanks for the

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,480
feedback i'm going to take some time

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
to process it and i'll get back to you

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,800
later

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,000
and while this might feel weird to say

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,240
it might sound forced or whatever it is

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
uh the more and more that you practice

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
this the better it'll get

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
and it'll just help you make it again a

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
regular practice to take that time that

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,839
you need

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,120
sometimes as i mentioned our body starts

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
to react in a certain way because our

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,959
our nervous system gets triggered and we

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,600
go into that fight

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,000
flight or freeze mode so if you notice

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,720
that your physical body is reacting

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,519
for example your heart is beating faster

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
your head

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,880
is getting hot or there's a lot of

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,440
pressure building

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,800
your body is very tense um

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,959
you can try a breathing exercise and

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,519
one of the things that or one of the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,040
breathing techniques that i've learned

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,480
is called the box breathing exercise or

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,759
in other words like four four four four

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,560
where you breathe in for four seconds

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,040
you hold it for four seconds and you

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,160
breathe

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
out for four seconds and then you repeat

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,600
that four times

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,720
at least four times and what this does

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
by holding the breath

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
even for four seconds it just helps you

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,000
lower

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
your heart rate and be able to start to

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,079
ground yourself

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,279
start to eliminate the physical symptoms

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,120
that you might get from

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,519
receiving the negative feedback

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,560
and the whole point of this is to really

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,759
process

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,839
the feedback because if somebody tells

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,519
you something even if it's not done very

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,399
tactfully or it's done

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,040
in what you think is a rude way there

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,440
might be

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
a kernel of truth in the feedback or

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,720
something that might actually help you

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,560
progress or improve in some way so when

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,279
you're processing the feedback

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,000
make sure to ask yourself things like

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,079
what is true

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
about what you heard what do you think

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
is biased

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,160
and how can you use the feedback to

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
progress

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,199
another thing that might help you as

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,480
you're trying to process

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,760
the feedback and be able to

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,679
respond appropriately is identifying

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,880
your triggers

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
there's this great book called thank you

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
for the feedback

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,600
the science and art of receiving

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
feedback well

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,559
and it talks about three different

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,679
triggers that we might experience

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,319
the first one is a truth trigger which

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,520
is

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,559
about the content of the feedback itself

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,840
we somehow feel that it's off unhelpful

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,960
or just not true there was

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,600
a relationship trigger where it's not

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
about

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,120
what the person said or the content

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
it's really more about the relationship

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
that we have with the person

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
so we might think that they're

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
unqualified to give it to us

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,760
or we might feel like they're our friend

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,200
and

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,720
they betrayed us so it ends up focusing

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
on you end up focusing on the

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
relationship instead of the feedback

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,799
itself

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
and then there's identity triggers where

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,760
the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,480
feedback that we just received causes us

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480
to question our sense of identity

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
we in this case we end up feeling

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
overwhelmed threatened ashamed and off

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,280
balance

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,760
and somehow we end up just trying to

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
survive

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,760
so now that we've talked about how to

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
receive feedback

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
and the different things that we need to

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
sort through as we're processing the

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
feedback

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
let's talk about ways to give better

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
feedback

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,600
and the first thing that we need to do

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,200
is think about the type of feedback

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,240
that we're trying to give in that same

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
book

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,840
we talk the author talks about three

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,360
different types of

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,919
feedback there's evaluation feedback

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,720
which helps the person understand where

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
they are

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,880
and the expectations there's coaching

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
feedback

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
that helps the person improve and

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,440
there's

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,520
positive or appreciation feedback which

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,520
motivates and encourages

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
when you're giving feedback it's also

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
good to make sure

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,520
you're giving the feedback to the right

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
person

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,120
at the right in the right place at the

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,919
right time

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,200
and what this means that you know with

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,360
the right person

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
it's probably best to approach the

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160
person that you have a misunderstanding

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
with

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
instead of speaking to four or five

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,200
other people and

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
you know maybe not getting to the bottom

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
of it so make sure you have the right

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
person that you're giving the feedback

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
to

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,880
in the right place in the right time so

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
for example

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,120
if you know that this person is about to

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,760
sign off it might be late in their day

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,200
you know that they typically tend to log

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,799
off around this time

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,960
or that it's in the middle of their work

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,159
day might not be the best

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,720
time to start a difficult conversation

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,559
instead you might want to ask them for

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,840
an hour or so of their time

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,320
to hop on a video chat or just to

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
hop on to element or something else

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
where you can chat

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,480
but in a more interrupted uninterrupted

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
way

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,080
another thing um i i participated in

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,200
this workshop

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,039
uh about a year ago that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,559
they talked about when you're giving

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,679
feedback to try to engage

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,039
both sides of your brain and and use

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,640
the structure of when i think it makes

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,960
me feel

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,200
and by this it's like when you're in a

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,240
difficult conversation you might say

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
when i think that you're ignoring me it

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
makes me

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,280
feel unheard uh

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,320
sad unappreciated

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,200
and so by by combining these two phrases

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,039
you end up uh not accusing somebody

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
because it's i think when i think that

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,200
this is happening

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,080
it makes me feel this way so it shifts

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,799
away from

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,039
it it helps uh make it so that the other

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,919
person doesn't have to get defensive

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,799
um and it lets them know how the action

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
made you feel

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
so it talks about emotions and then you

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,760
would have a a

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,760
conversation around that in a way where

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,679
it sort of de-escalates the feelings

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
around it so you might want to give that

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,120
a try

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
another thing even though we just talked

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,159
about how different cultures

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,200
give negative feedback in different ways

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,799
generally tend towards giving positive

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,240
feedback in public

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,840
and negative feedback in private

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
this will help just as you're giving

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,600
feedback

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,600
uh to people around different cultures

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,919
okay this is a section that i just put

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
in

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,440
um because i think it's really

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,799
interesting this idea about

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,320
intent versus impact because i think

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,360
that there's a larger

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,720
gap between intent and impact

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,320
in fos communities because we mostly

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,640
interact in virtual settings

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,440
and for those of you who are new to

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
intent

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,840
versus impact i just want to throw out a

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,880
definition

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,600
and this is that intent is what you mean

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,640
to say

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,679
or do and impact

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,960
is how your audience perceives

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,480
what you do or what you say so it's what

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,799
you intended

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:45,200
to happen versus what actually happened

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:48,480
now what influences our perception

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,480
in person we get a lot of cues

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,240
you can look at somebody's body language

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
whether they're smiling when they give

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,000
you the

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,600
feedback or they're frowning or

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,360
you know their tone of voice is a

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,720
certain way their

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,679
uh volume is really upset

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,440
or you know like higher you can you can

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,799
get these cues to let you know

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,280
how somebody might be feeling online we

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
don't

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,720
usually have that so instead things that

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,880
influence our perception might be

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,039
what we think we know about the person

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,600
for example oh we know that person is

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,520
based

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,559
in germany or oh this person uses a lot

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,280
of emojis

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
or doesn't punctuate or different things

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
like this

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,120
those are the things that influence our

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
perception

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
and i think that the gap between intent

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,559
and impact again

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,840
is larger because and and here's an

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,400
example

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,159
if you're filing a bug report and you

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,279
say something like

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,279
this bug is so irritating it makes me

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,880
want to jump out of a window

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,880
and meanwhile you know you're sipping on

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,840
some tea in front of your computer

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,880
you're just kind of multitasking and

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
you just that's what you write and your

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,320
intent with writing

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
this was you know filing a bug report

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,720
that you think is

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
mildly annoying um you added the

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,760
the jumping out of the window part

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
because that's your sense of humor you

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
think it's kind of funny

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,720
and you're actually in a good mood

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,120
because you're sipping on some tea

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
but because it's written and people

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
can't tell this about you

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,120
the impact might actually be very

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,320
different or the person who reads it

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
might think you're really

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,760
angry and that might make them really

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,279
angry

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,279
or make them sad

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,679
so what i want people to take away from

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,880
this

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,760
is that intent and impact are equally

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
important

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,799
it doesn't just matter what you wanted

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,640
to

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,480
uh convey or what you intended

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
the impact of what you actually did

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
instead is just as

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,159
important and just the same

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,840
when you are impacted it's important to

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,400
try to understand

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,360
what the person's intent really was in

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
order to

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,400
reduce that gap

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,400
when we're talking about reducing the

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
gap

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,200
the sbi model is something that can be

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,200
really useful

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,799
and for those of you not familiar with

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
the sbi model

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,960
here's what it means the s stands for

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,600
situation

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,320
so you describe the situation and you're

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,240
specific about where it occurred

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,120
the b is about behavior so you describe

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,440
observable behavior and you don't assume

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,840
what

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,840
you think the other person was thinking

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,640
i is for impact and that is describing

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,520
your emotions your feelings your

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
reaction

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,200
from the observable behavior and then

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,880
finally

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,400
this is what you're really getting at is

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
the intent so

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,240
you want to ask what the person's

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,840
original intent is

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,600
after you go after that sbi

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
and to make this a little bit more

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,679
tangible for people

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,960
here's what an example would look like

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,039
so when you're having a difficult

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
conversation you know you you think that

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,279
somebody did some like sent you an

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,559
email that was really hurtful you might

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,880
want to approach them

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,400
and describe it in this way where you

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
say for example

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,440
hey when you responded to the email i

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,279
sent about engagement ideas last friday

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,480
that's describing the situation and

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,080
you're very specific

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,400
about it was last friday and via email

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,679
then you described the behavior you said

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
that i shouldn't have

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,240
that i didn't have a background in

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,480
design so my opinion shouldn't count

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,080
and then that's you know not having

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
judgment you're not saying like that was

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,240
really rude

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,559
or whatever it is and then you describe

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,919
the

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,520
impact so that made me feel excluded

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,440
from the conversation

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960
even though it's a community-wide topic

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,320
and i felt hurt

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,960
by the public comment and that really

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,320
like lets them know what the impact was

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
then you want to follow that up with a

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,600
question of something like

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
what were you hoping to accomplish with

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,960
that or can you help me understand

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,679
what went like what was happening there

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,200
um and this again helps us understand

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,440
what their intent was

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,320
it also lets them know what the impact

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,399
was again in order to reduce that gap

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,399
between intent and impact

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,799
okay we're now on to the section

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,480
about requesting feedback it's just one

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,640
slide so stay with me

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,399
um because when we first started this

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,799
section we talked about how

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,919
requesting feedback is linked with

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,840
higher performance

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,000
and more creativity and all these good

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,399
things

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
so when you're requesting feedback you

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,240
want to make sure

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
that you make it specific asking

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,159
somebody a broad question

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,240
like can you give me feedback on my

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
presentation

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,399
isn't going to give you the level of

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,600
detail or maybe what you're hoping for

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,640
as a more specific request like can you

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,840
give me feedback

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,080
on how quickly i speak and how much

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,440
eye contact i make during my

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,000
presentation

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
then you get people like tangible things

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
that they should be looking for

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,279
and they'll be able to better give you

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
that feedback

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,679
another thing is to solicit feedback

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,640
from multiple sources

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,559
so ask for five different people because

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,320
they might have different perspectives

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,279
or might simply catch something that

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,279
someone else missed

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,000
all right so let's talk now about active

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,480
listening because we can't always just

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,919
talk

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,039
we also need to listen

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,840
and i love this quote by richard carlson

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,440
which says that being heard and

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,919
understood

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,640
is one of the greatest desires of the

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,640
human heart

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,600
and i don't know about you but i've been

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,120
in situations before

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,039
where the speaker is talking and

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,559
there's somebody else listening and the

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,960
speaker says

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,320
you know you're just not listening to me

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
and the person listening

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,240
is able to repeat exactly what they've

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,880
been saying for the last five minutes

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,000
and the person speaking is like okay you

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
heard me but

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,360
but you're still not listening and it's

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,600
frustrating for both

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,399
the listener and the speaker because

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
there's

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,440
some kind of miscommunication there the

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,799
the person

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
the speaker doesn't feel heard and the

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,760
listener is frustrated because

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,840
they're actually listening so in order

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,919
to help with this situation

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,799
let's talk about different types of

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:51,200
listening that we can engage in

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:54,320
the first is distracted listening

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,679
and this is when you're multitasking are

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,240
preoccupied you're simply distracted

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,080
there's content listening where you're

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,559
listening to the facts and res

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,159
and planning on how to respond so for

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,640
example if somebody's talking and you're

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,240
like

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,320
oh i have to respond to this and then

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,320
you start thinking about your answer

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,360
and meanwhile you've stopped listening

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
to them because you're

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,880
thinking about how to respond there's

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,640
also identifying listening

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
where you're trying to respond with a

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,640
similar situation

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,480
to show that you understand so let's say

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,880
that your friend is going to

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
hawaii next month and they're so excited

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,559
about this hawaii trip and they just

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,200
want to tell you all about their plans

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,720
and you listen and then you're like i

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,960
went to hawaii last

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,880
last year let me tell you about that i

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,559
did this and that and this and that

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
and now instead of listening you're

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,559
talking so you're no longer listening

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,720
and then there's problem solving which

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,960
especially when we care about the person

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,080
we're invested in that relationship we

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,559
just want to help them solve the problem

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,080
and what we have to understand is that

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,120
someone may not be ready

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,720
to start solving that problem so what i

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,760
want you to take away from this

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,080
is that active listening is the best

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,360
type of listening that we can do

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,159
and this is where we hear the facts

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,120
and the feelings and we respond

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,399
appropriately

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,519
to both and what this means

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,120
is that for example if you have somebody

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,360
that comes in

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,360
they're visibly upset they might be

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,840
pacing and holding their head

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,519
and just unable to really articulate

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,760
themselves

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,799
instead of automatically starting to

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,480
problem solve

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,840
you might realize that really what they

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,799
need is a hug

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,760
maybe some ice cream and then maybe in

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,240
an hour or two

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,200
then they'll be ready to problem solve

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,120
or maybe

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,279
you should be asking them some questions

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,840
before and just listening letting them

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,279
you know vent for a while and then go

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,440
into problem solving

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,120
so active listening is all about

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,440
listening to both the facts

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,960
and the feelings recognizing they're

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,200
both just as important

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,600
and then trying to respond appropriately

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,640
to both

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,000
great active listening sounds like gold

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,039
but how do we do this so the first

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,080
is that we can use simple

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,399
signals and simple questions to help

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,960
with active listening

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,159
much like a traffic light is green

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,559
yellow and red

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,600
to show us if we should go yield or stop

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,760
our actions and what we say

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,880
helps people know whether they should

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,720
continue to talk

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,600
stop or slow down

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
so for example with our actions looking

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,760
at people in the eye

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,120
putting down our phone um and and

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,919
really being there with you know our

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,600
pointing our body in their direction etc

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,080
helps them understand what that were

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,600
there

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,600
it signals them to go

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,200
and verbal cues are just as important it

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,320
can't just all be body language

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,480
so with verbal cues you can say you can

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,919
ask simple questions or just

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,480
um little words that help

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,679
show that you're along that same story

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,960
so things like

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,440
really or oh wow

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,159
oh my gosh that's crazy things like this

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,039
are like

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,640
you know what what did you do next how

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,200
did they respond

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,039
all of those things help somebody know

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,919
that we're there that we're engaged that

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,120
we're

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,880
that we're with them that they should

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,279
continue to go

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,480
another thing that helps us engage in

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,480
active listening

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,519
is paraphrasing and this is something

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,279
that i'm still

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,360
trying to get better at because it's

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,840
very powerful

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,640
and what this is is not repeating word

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,760
for word what somebody said

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,799
it's instead identifying key words and

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,240
the meaning

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,960
of what has been said and making sure

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,640
that you

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,119
fully understood what the message was

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
and paraphrase paraphrasing is really

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,560
important because

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
sometimes the speaker might not have

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,639
said what they really meant

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,720
or maybe you didn't understand what they

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,679
actually wanted to say

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,480
so when you paraphrase and you get it

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,879
right

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,760
it helps the speaker feel truly

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,599
understood

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,960
and hurt it also the cool thing about it

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,679
is that you don't have to agree with

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,720
them

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,079
you could say something like uh

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,480
okay so i hear you um what i hear you

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,480
say is that you think that next year's

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:48,000
open source 101 should be in a volcano

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,359
is that right and then the person's like

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,440
yes that's exactly what i meant

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,119
and you might think that you know having

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,639
the conference in a volcano might not be

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,240
the best idea

00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,839
but you showed that you at least

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,800
understand what the other person is

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,440
saying

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,079
and that you know you can then have that

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,800
discussion

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,920
it can buy you time it buys space for

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,480
more ideas

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,119
all the stuff and sometimes when you

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
just

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,240
paraphrase and you show that you really

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,720
understood

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,680
it can provide a summary that can lead

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,079
to closure

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,720
you see the person's shoulders visibly

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,119
relaxed

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,240
like they they feel that you have

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,680
understood them

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,680
so it's a pretty cool tool

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,200
and active listening is something that

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,520
is important for building relationships

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,280
whether you're in the virtual world or

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,200
in person

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
you can definitely use these principles

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,400
online but more importantly when we're

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,720
back in

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,200
in-person events you can use these to

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,040
build relationships that will then

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,960
carry on into the online world

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,079
all right we have just a few minutes

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,599
left so i'll share

00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,400
my favorite hacks the first is that it's

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,520
the writer's job to be understood

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,320
and formatting really helps so

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,839
by this i mean that we should avoid long

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,400
sentences

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,640
if you see many ands you can try to

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,960
instead bring it up into two sentences

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,839
don't assume previous knowledge so try

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,920
to make it

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,960
so that anybody can jump right into the

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,440
conversation

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,280
or into the issue into the bug report

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
etc

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,400
do a skim test look through

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
what you've just written and make sure

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,079
that somebody can quickly

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,040
look at it in just a few seconds and

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,119
understand

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,280
the main points so for example here i've

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,160
put a summary of each sentence at the

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,040
beginning of each

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,320
bullet and have made it purple so that

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,000
it's easy to really

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
read even the first little bit and

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,079
understand what the rest is about

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,000
and this helps because even if you use

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,800
bullets it can look like a wall of

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,640
text and then also it helps people be

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
able to refer back to it because they

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,839
can skim back what they've already read

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,040
and quickly and easily like read more

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,000
thoroughly or whatever

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,720
they need and then make sure that what

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,960
you've written has a call to action

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,960
so make sure that some people know who

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,560
needs to do it by when

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,560
um and that it's just clear

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,320
and we can all do this in the issues and

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,440
the bug reports and everything else that

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,400
we're writing

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
so for example this is a git lab issue

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,160
from

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,880
our social team where they've created a

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,839
template

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,720
called social general request where

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
they've used

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,000
headings to help you understand the

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,240
different sections of

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,480
what you need to fill out they've used

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,760
emoticons to help make it a little more

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,160
visibly

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,160
appealing they've used things like bold

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,560
and numbering and check boxes

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,720
and things like that so that it's easier

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,520
to act and to do things that they need

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,520
you to perform

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,079
all right this next principle is called

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
yes and

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,520
and this is simply that instead of

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,280
saying no

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,800
or yes but you say yes

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,800
and and i i don't know if you've heard

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,640
this before but often times you say that

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,119
anything before the butt doesn't really

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,000
matter

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,480
you say yeah yeah but this is what i

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,160
mean

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,160
like none of the rest really matters

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,560
it's really just after the butt

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,839
this kind of this this helps with that

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,000
because what you're doing

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,880
is you are acknowledging what the person

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
is saying

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,000
and then you can still disagree with

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,119
them so yes

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,920
i understand that this is what you

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,200
what you think and i think that we

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,599
should also consider

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,839
this and so what it does by

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,680
acknowledging the other persons

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,040
thoughts and and really what they were

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,839
saying it makes

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,440
them more likely to listen to you and to

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,119
acknowledge your point of view

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,640
because if they feel ignored or like

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,440
you're not really taking into account

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,720
what they're

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,920
saying they're more less likely to um

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,040
to listen to you so try using yes and

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,359
it's a whole like state of mind even

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,000
and it really helps to build

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,000
collaboration

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,760
last but not least collaborative phrases

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
by using these

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,880
simple little word changes you can

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,320
unlock

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,800
uh collaboration so for example saying

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,280
instead of saying something like we need

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,240
to get more social media

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,079
engagement you might say how might we

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,520
get more social media

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,760
engagement and this shifts it so that

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,160
others feel like they can participate

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,720
they might end up taking more ownership

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,480
because they've had a chance to actually

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,599
brainstorm and be

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,359
considered uh other collaborative

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,000
phrases include things like

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,200
might i suggest we what are your

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,839
thoughts

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,960
um and and then different ways of just

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,960
voicing your idea

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,359
in the end i know we're or pretty much a

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,359
time

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,720
but i want to end with this really

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,920
strong powerful quote by john powell

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:15,839
which is that communication works

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,880
for those who work at it communication

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,359
is a technical skill that we all

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,560
need to keep building that helps us not

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,680
only in open source

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,760
but in all areas of our life

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
and again it's something that we can

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,880
build so

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,240
i hope you have taken some uh

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,680
some learnings from my uh

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,920
for my speech today that you can start

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,720
applying right away

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,640
and if you have any questions i'd be

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,280
happy to answer a few of them

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,839
in the minutes that we have left and if

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,319
not

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,839
feel free to tweet me or send me a

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,839
message on linkedin

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,200
all right i'm going to stop

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:06,160
sharing my screen and

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:09,040
i will look

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,040
the questions

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,960
okay so

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,160
here i see a few um

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,640
somebody mark hutchinson hutchinson says

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,359
or asks what are the best ways to deal

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,800
with trolls and bots

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,720
and you know that's a good question

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,440
i've talked a lot about communication

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,960
and how to engage in difficult

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
conversations i think that with trolls i

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
mean

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
kind of the definition of a troll is

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,880
that they're trying to poke

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,520
and make uh cause difficult situations

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,119
and in those cases oftentimes you just

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,480
need to disengage

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,280
and to lean in on your code of conduct

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,160
to help um to help with those situations

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,720
it might be

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,520
ejecting that community member if they

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,119
persist

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,480
in violating the code of conduct so

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,599
um all right the next

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,319
question is also from mark i run a meet

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,079
up group

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,920
trying to get the members to suggest

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,400
topics and speakers

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,000
is akin to pulling teeth got any

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,720
suggestions on growing member

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,640
involvement

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,119
in user groups um i think that's more

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,680
about

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,359
engagement in general so not necessarily

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,440
about the topic that i'm covering in

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,040
this communication hacks

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,079
um but i think that uh

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,440
you know with topics and speakers so

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,200
something that

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,960
um we're doing at gitlab for example um

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,560
one of the things that you know we all

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,359
hear is that it's some

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,800
oftentimes difficult for women to

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,960
volunteer to speak

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,400
um for many different reasons or to get

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,800
women speakers

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,160
and um one of the things that we're

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,440
doing is a beyond

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,480
code series where people will be able to

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,040
talk about

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,240
how they use gitlab in their day-to-day

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,440
jobs

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,319
outside of coding because gitlab

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,359
uses its own platform for everything

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,560
from accounting

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,640
to sales to uh marketing to

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,400
you know coding and engineering practice

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,440
or you know work

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,800
so by expanding the topics

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,160
and then um also like

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,160
messaging people in in uh

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,480
in chats that are specific to uh

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,160
like we have for example a women tmrg

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,800
group which is like a women's

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,520
team resource group um adding stuff

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,800
there

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,079
um and like also messaging people

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,359
uh one to one inviting them and that has

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,480
been really powerful

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:53,520
so takeaways make sure that you're

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
uh you know seeking to broaden your

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,480
pipeline

00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,599
and really um you know

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,480
identifying other communities where you

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,880
can

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,720
um try to recruit from that might align

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,359
with your own community

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,480
and and two encouraging people

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,440
personally

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,760
um that is a really powerful way to get

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,800
more

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,839
engagement all right

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,599
uh we have one minute left who

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,079
determines what the values of an open

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,280
source

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,720
project is um again this is not

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,160
necessarily

00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,800
the um uh

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,480
part of my oh okay i might even be

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,079
reading questions that are not to my

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,119
for my um for my talk but also

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,599
on this i think that um the community

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,400
together

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,359
needs to um come up with the shared

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,280
values

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,359
and off and i think that the board of

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,760
directors or the governing group has

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,599
a big role to play in in facilitating

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,920
that

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,520
all right i hope i answered questions

00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,880
from everybody for my session

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,599
and also other people's sessions and

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
if you have any other questions feel

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,359
free

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:15,839
to message me on twitter or linkedin
