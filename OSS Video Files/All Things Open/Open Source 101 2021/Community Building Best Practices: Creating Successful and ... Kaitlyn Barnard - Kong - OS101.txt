Description: 
	Kaitlyn Barnard, Developer Marketing Manager at Kong, delivered the talk "Community Building Best Practices: Creating Successful and Sustainable Open Source Communities" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Open-source technologies are becoming vital to many businesses, but what about the community around them? Building awareness, encouraging contributions, and increasing adoption can be challenging for any open source project. So how are some of the most popular communities achieving success?

In this talk, Kaitlyn will share best practices for building and engaging open source communities that have been learned through building the Cloud Native Ambassador and Kong Champions programs.

This talk will cover:
Building a sustainable community around your open source project
How to encourage and incentivize contributions

hello everyone

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,480
um thank you so much for joining me

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
today here at open source 101 i am super

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
excited to share with you

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
some of the best practices that i have

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,840
learned for building successful and

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,240
sustainable open source communities over

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,240
the years

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
so let me start off by introducing

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
myself my name is caitlin barnard and i

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
currently lead developer marketing at

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
kong

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,480
which includes all of our open source

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
community programs as well

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
prior to that i was at cncf where i

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,760
worked heavily in the kubernetes

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,239
community and i still do

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,120
i'm co-chair for sig docs where i lead

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,960
the kubernetes blog subproject

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
and then i always like to throw in a dog

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,879
picture for good measure

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,520
this is bruce as in bruce wayne batman

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
um he is my favorite pandemic co-worker

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,840
even though he does tend to like to

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,840
interrupt my afternoon zoo meetings

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
all right so a quick overview of what

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,320
you can expect from this session

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
i'm going to talk about the three major

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,880
types

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
of programs that i like to think about

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
when it comes to building open source

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
communities

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
the first is user program so we're going

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
to talk about how to increase

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,880
awareness and adoption of your open

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
source project

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
contributors so we'll talk about how to

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
increase code contributions

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
and community engagement for your open

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,799
source project and ambassadors so we'll

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
talk about how to build an advocacy

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,600
program around your open source project

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
as well

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,479
then at the end we're going to get into

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
metrics and how to measure and

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
communicate the success

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
of your community efforts there should

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
be plenty of time for at the end for q

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
a so please feel free to drop any

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,759
questions in the q a tab throughout

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
but i will also try to get to any

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,079
immediate questions throughout the

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,079
presentation as well

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
so i'm going to be talking about

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
creating community programs from scratch

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
and i'll be referencing my experience

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,119
building these programs at both kong and

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,360
cncf

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,439
so at kong our open source community

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,000
spans four main projects

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
kong gateway which is an api gateway

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,879
kuma

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,480
which is a service mesh built on top of

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,440
envoy and then a sandbox project of cncf

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,280
insomnia which is an api design platform

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,879
and then kubernetes ingress controller

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
which is essentially a wrapper

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
of our api gateway to use natively in

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
kubernetes

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
we have over a hundred thousand

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
community members across all of these

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
projects

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
with kong gateway being our largest and

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
then kuma being our newest so i manage a

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,760
variety of community

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
sizes under this kong umbrella

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
then from cncf i'm going to be

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
referencing the cloud native ambassadors

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
program

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
i'm going to be talking about the

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,959
earlier days of the program when it was

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,959
only 50 ambassadors across 14 countries

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,000
it's much larger now there are over 100

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
ambassadors currently

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
so i want to start off by talking about

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
user programs because

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,760
awareness and adoption of your open

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,480
source project is going to be the

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
foundation

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,519
for most of what i'm going to be talking

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,239
about today

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,599
so let's start off by learning um you

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,840
know how you can attract

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,840
open source users to your open source

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
project

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,680
and anytime i create a new community

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
program i start with setting the goals

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
for what we're trying to achieve

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,319
and user programs are typically geared

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
towards these three things

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,480
building awareness around your open

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
source project to bring in new users

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,159
creating a smooth onboarding process for

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
users to get started

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,519
and then maintaining a great user

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
experience for existing users

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,840
and providing ongoing support so they

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
want to stick around

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
so how do you go about building this

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
awareness for your open source

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,720
project and there's a lot more ways to

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
do this than i'm going to get to in this

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,599
presentation

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
but i want to talk about the number one

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
way i approach this

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,879
which is to focus on the problem you're

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,239
solving and turn that into educational

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
content

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
so no one likes to be sold to but

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
everybody does like to learn about a

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
tool that's going to make their life

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
easier in some way

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
so let's say a developer for example is

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,799
running into some type of problem

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,320
or building something and they go to

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,360
google to search for what their options

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
are

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,880
what are those search terms that should

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
be returning

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,360
information about your project and then

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,880
once you identify those

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
you can do a few different things to

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,280
help get your project off the ground

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,840
you can create these seo rich blog posts

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520
and videos of tutorial content

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,280
you know explaining how to do it how

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,880
your project simplifies this

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,919
or solves a pain point you can then

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,639
carry that same

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,840
seo optimization into your website

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,199
housing your blog content there

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,759
documentation and continue to build that

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
seo

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
and referral traffic from those keywords

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
speaking about these topics at industry

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
conferences user groups

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,880
meetups can help build awareness around

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
your project as well

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
and then even hosting your own user

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
groups either in person or online

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,360
can be a great way to support the

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,560
community if that's something you have

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
the bandwidth to do as well

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
and then once you've created this

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,000
content share it

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
did you write a tutorial that solves a

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,960
common problem on stack overflow for

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,639
example

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,560
you can amplify that content on social

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
media and

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
things like syndicating or guest

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
blogging on a third-party website as

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
well

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,360
so not only does this help get more

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,680
eyeballs on your content

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
but backlinking also helps improve your

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,639
search rankings to bring in more organic

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,639
traffic as well

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,320
and then the last one i have on here is

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,479
does your project integrate with another

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
popular technology in the space

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
or are there existing user stories that

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
you can share

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,120
to help other users get started and

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
highlight their success

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,440
so for example we talk a lot about kong

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,000
gateway and kubernetes

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,800
or kong gateway and service mesh so this

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,280
helps potential users find your project

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,880
because they are already leveraging that

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,800
other technology that you're writing

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,280
about and including them there

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
um if you're a commercially backed open

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,039
source project you can leverage your

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,840
internal marketing team for this

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600
um or for a project like kubernetes they

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
have their own marketing team

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
within their contributor experience

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,680
group that helps drive

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
these initiatives

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
so then once you start building

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,800
awareness around your project

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
it's important to make sure you have

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,280
programs in place to support the new and

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
existing users

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,880
onboarding so making sure that you have

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
a clear onboarding process

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,199
in your documentation to help users get

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,919
started quickly and easily

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,599
at kong we also expand this into a

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
five-part email series

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,360
where you can subscribe to it and we

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,199
deliver all of our getting started tips

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
and tricks directly to your inbox

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,120
monthly new user calls is also a great

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,319
way to provide additional touch points

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,599
to new users

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
and then you can kind of walk them

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
through getting started with the project

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
and answer any questions that they have

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
live

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
documentation and technical content so

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,759
good documentation across the board is

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
really crucial

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
and i'm not going to get into that too

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
much in this presentation but i also

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,400
like to have

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
in-depth blog posts and videos available

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
as well

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
the benefit of this is that it allows

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,840
you to cover more specific use cases

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,599
that might not necessarily fit into

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,440
documentation

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
it also helps cater to different

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
people's learning styles as well between

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,560
both written

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,560
and video

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,520
community calls and user groups so at

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,720
cong we do a monthly online meetup

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,400
um for new and existing users where we

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
talk about features from our most recent

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
release

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,120
demo them and then we open it up to any

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
questions

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
it's also a great way to get the

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
community face to face

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
and dive into those questions that are

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
top of mind with

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,759
with the engineering team and users

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,759
directly

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we also have on-demand workshops that

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
walk you through getting started with

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,120
our open source project so these are all

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,360
kind of follow along self-serve

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,959
workshops in our learning environment

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
and then we also try to host these

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
workshops live quarterly

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,000
with more one-on-one interactions with

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,399
our engineering team

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,320
and then forums and chat so this is

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
about making sure users know where to

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
get help

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
either from project maintainers or other

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,360
community members who are sharing their

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,040
expertise as well

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
this can be something like a dedicated

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,200
discourse forum

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,279
a slack channel or a mailing list but i

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,880
do like to have solutions for both live

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,880
and asynchronous communication

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,399
all right so next up let's talk about

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,399
contributor programs

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
um so again i like to start with setting

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
the goals for the program

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,040
but when setting the goals for

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,399
contributor programs i also like to

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
start with the why

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
because this is going to differ a lot

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
depending on the needs of your project

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,640
specifically

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
and there can be a wide variety of

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,440
different types of contributing

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,279
contributors to target here as well so

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
do you absolutely need to have code

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,120
contributors to be able to build and

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,279
scale your project

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
or maybe you have an internal

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
engineering team

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
or corporate contributors already

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
focused on this aspect of it

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
and it's more important to bring in

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
contributions that can support community

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
engagement initiatives

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
things like creating content on their

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
use case

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,480
working on documentation driving project

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
awareness

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,839
helping new users get started answering

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
questions on forums

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,120
etc so

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
the type of contributors you're looking

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
for and the way you structure your

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:18,480
program is going to depend

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:20,720
a lot on what this y is

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
so once you figure that out there's a

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,040
few ways to start building your

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
contributor pipeline

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,240
the first is existing users so this is

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
more so about creating a clear and

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,920
simple path to contribution

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
which is a great way to leverage the

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,600
expertise of people already using your

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
project

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
and we'll talk more about how to do this

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
on the next slide

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,959
adjacent communities so for example at

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
kong

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,440
um kong is built on top of lua and open

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,040
rusty so we get a lot of contributors

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,880
from those communities because it's

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
really easy for them to contribute to

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
kong

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,040
because they're already familiar with

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,200
the technology that it's built on

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,800
our engineers also end up contributing

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
back to these projects as well so

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
there's

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
great cross-pollination between the

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
communities and at the end of the day

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,640
that really benefits the overall

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
ecosystem

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
integration and technology partners so

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,839
are there technology partners out there

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
that would benefit from building a

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
plug-in or integration with your project

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
you can figure out mutually beneficial

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,480
ways here where you can leverage each

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,079
other's communities and reach out to

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,440
them to discuss partner opera

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,440
partner opportunities there

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,160
and then the last is students and

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,839
academics contributing to open source

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
can be a great way to get development

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
experience and network with other

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,120
developers in the space

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
um maybe you can do something like

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
support a student hackathon

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
partner with professors on product on

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,880
projects for example

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
um but you know work with students to

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
get more

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
um you know awareness and contributions

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
to the project

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,800
all right so then to make it really easy

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
and appealing for people to contribute

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,360
to your project

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,160
i like to set up these four processes

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
the first is is the contributor guide so

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
this should outline ways

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,399
for contributors to get involved and the

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,480
entire contributor process from start to

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,079
finish

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
the contributors guide should also

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,839
include a clear review process

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
because one of the worst experiences for

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
a contributor is they do all the hard

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
work to contribute something

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,480
and their issue or pr gets stuck in

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,320
limbo for months with no answer

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
so the review process should be clearly

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
documented

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
straightforward they should understand

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
when they should respec

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,000
expect a response to their contribution

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,000
and then know who to ask if they don't

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
and then places to get help so there

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
should be a place for contributors to

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
get help and ask questions if they need

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,560
it especially if they haven't maybe

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
received a response to their

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,720
contribution if they have a question on

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,600
it

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,399
um things like slack online office hours

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
for example

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
and then make sure all of this is in a

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,480
central location so github

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,320
a community hub confluence for example

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
there should be some type of one-stop

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,600
shop where any new or existing

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,680
contributor can go to get this

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
information

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,240
and then let's talk about contributor

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,240
recognition on the next slide

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,399
all right so

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,160
it's always really important to remember

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,760
that these people are contributing their

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
time for free

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
so how can you thank them and make them

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
feel seen

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,199
and also give them an opportunity to

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,240
grow both personally and professionally

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,920
so at kong we have this concept of code

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
and non-code contributors

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
you might be familiar with this if

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
you've worked in the kubernetes

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
community before

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
they do something similar and code

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,279
contributors is

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,160
quite literally someone that contributes

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,720
code to the project repo

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
whereas a non-code contributor create

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
content

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
like videos blog posts although this can

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
absolutely manifest

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,560
in many other ways beyond content as

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,560
well

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
both of these are equally valuable to

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,680
our community but they do contribute in

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,160
different ways

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,079
so we like to balance the recognition

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,320
depending on the contribution type

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,959
and what is important to that individual

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
contributor

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
there's a few things that stay the same

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,079
between the two

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,560
but i'll talk about what we do for each

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
so for code contributors we do things

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,519
like contributor shirts

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,279
so if your pr is accepted you're

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
eligible to receive a contributor shirt

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
and we do a fun custom design

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,040
each year so you can keep coming back

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
and be eligible for them year over year

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,440
contributor perks we do things like

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,000
discounted access to kong summit which

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,079
is our yearly conference

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,920
we do special events for contributors at

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,880
the summit itself

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,079
we also do a first look at new features

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
on our roadmap

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,120
really anything that has exclusive

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
access

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,199
our contributors and ambassadors get

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,160
access uh our contributors ambassadors

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,160
get access to it first

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,320
contributor spotlight so we like to

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
highlight contributors and ambassadors

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
and the work they've done in our

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
newsletters and blog posts

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,920
we also will eventually expand this to

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,959
fuller interview styles to me

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,639
to meet each of them cncf has done a

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,839
similar meet the ambassador video

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,839
interview series as well

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,279
and then a clear path to taking on a

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
larger role

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,880
so what does going from contributor to

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,399
maintainer look like

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,079
what does going from contributor to

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,839
ambassador look like

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,079
this goes back to that personal and

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,279
professional development aspect on how

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,519
to give people a clear

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,399
roadmap to taking on more responsibility

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,399
within the project

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,560
so i see one question here what's an

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,040
example of a non-code contribution

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,240
so an example of a non-code contribution

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
would be

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,880
um writing a blog post on how you're

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
using kong

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
um we've done some where they will

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,680
actually

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
do a video tutorial on a feature that

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
they've

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,680
contributed to the project and walk you

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
through step by step

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,880
how to do that and we'll put that on

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
youtube so those are the two biggest

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:37,839
examples for us

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:37,839
um as well

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
um okay so for

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
non-code contributions this in my

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,040
opinion is just as valuable as code

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
because people are bringing in new users

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,519
and awareness for your project

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,720
so we do things like custom swag for

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
blog posts

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
so you could earn a contributor shirt

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,360
for a code contribution

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,439
and a custom gorilla for a non-code

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,280
contribution

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,559
so if you write a blog post for us we'll

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,720
reach out with contributor swag as well

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,439
contributor perks are typically the same

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,280
between the two

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,720
contributor spotlight we do a little bit

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,039
differently so for

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
um non-code contributions we will do

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,120
things like amplify the content that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,919
they've created on our channels

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,120
um retweet it on twitter cross post it

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
to our site

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
have the maybe guest blog on our site

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,200
really however we can help

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,200
get more eyes on their content

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,960
and then that same clear path to taking

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
on a larger role

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,320
so this could look a little bit

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,280
different depending on how your project

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
is set up

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
but it could be the same as like

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,520
contributor to ambassador

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,960
or it could be a special role within the

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
project so for example

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
in kubernetes we have the blog

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
subproject lead

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,640
which is a non-code contributor role so

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,280
it's a leadership role

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:15,360
within the open source project to run

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:16,720
the kubernetes blog essentially

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,760
awesome so now let's move on to

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,760
ambassador programs

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,760
so before we dive in i often get asked

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,039
what an ambassador or what an ambassador

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
program is

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,480
so i wanted to include my own quick

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,039
explanation of what this is in here

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,160
so ambassadors are frequent users or

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,160
contributors

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,640
of an open source project that help

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,200
evangelize the project by sharing their

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,160
expertise and passion through speaking

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,120
blogging forum discussion and any other

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,559
form of community engagement

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,600
an ambassador program provides guidance

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
and resources

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,360
to help facilitate ambassador

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,400
participation in the community

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,679
so essentially what this is is it helps

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,919
create a structure so

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:11,840
the ambassador can focus on doing the

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,840
advocacy work that they enjoy

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,320
so when starting when thinking about

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,039
starting an ambassador program

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240
i like to first explore if it makes

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,400
sense

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
because one of the things i often see is

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,520
that a leadership team

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,760
will say they want to have an ambassador

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
program but they haven't really thought

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
through the goals

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
how this fits into their overall

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
community strategy

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
and that can be a really difficult

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
position to be put in as a community

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
manager to have to manage those

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
expectations

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,919
especially if it's determined that maybe

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,200
it's not the right fit for your business

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,799
or your community at this time so

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,760
there's two indicators that i like to

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
look at before we try to start one

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
and the first is is there a clear path

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,760
to contribution

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,720
your contributor pipeline has to be

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
really healthy

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,159
before that can feed into your

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
ambassador pipeline because these are

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
going to be the candidates you're going

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,600
to end up pulling from

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,679
you really can't have active ambassadors

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,880
if you don't have active contributors

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
and users in the first place

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080
and then the second is do you have the

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,480
internal buy-in to support the program

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,360
ambassadors can require a lot of support

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,039
and resources

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,400
from you internally to make them

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
effective so

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,159
is your organization or project willing

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,600
to support that

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
do they understand the value of the

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,280
program and then

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,880
at the end of the day do they care about

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
supporting the community in that way

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
so setting goals is the next thing i

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,480
like to do because

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,559
one it ensures that it fits into our

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,960
strategy and then two

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,720
it helps get buy-in because then this is

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,760
what the entire team is

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,039
agreeing to work towards

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
these can always differ between

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,760
communities but for me it's almost

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,039
always

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
these four so we want ambassadors out in

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
the community creating awareness for

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,880
what the technology is

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
we want them educating the local and

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
global community on how to use the

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
technology

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,039
we want them to expand that contributor

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,960
pipeline and bring in new users

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,679
by sharing their journey and helping

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
others to get started

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
and then we want them to grow personally

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,120
and professionally

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,880
by being part of our community as well

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,720
because at the end of the day

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
this program really should be rewarding

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
to them

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,280
okay so now that we've got our goals

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,440
how do we start building our ambassador

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,520
program and there's four initial things

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
that i like to do here

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
the first is to reach out to your

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,600
contributor pipeline and

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
existing users not only are they

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
potential ambassadors

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,280
but you can also find out what they

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,880
would want out of an ambassador program

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,400
and build around that so for cncf

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
we started with people already doing

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,000
these things on their own

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,600
establishing the community so for

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,919
example running a

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,440
running a kubernetes meetup in their

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,720
local area

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,880
and then we built the program around

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
that for kong

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,559
we started with our most active

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,440
contributors and users of the project

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
and built around them

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,080
the second is to do your research what

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
other communities already exist in the

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
space

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,520
what's working for them what isn't

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,120
working how can you differentiate

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,559
the reason for this is a lot of people

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
are going to be part of multiple

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,360
communities

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,760
and you don't really want to have the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
exact same replica of a program someone

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,480
is already

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,159
in but you also don't need to fully

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
reinvent the wheel

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,360
um when you can kind of learn best

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,000
practices from others already doing this

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,679
as well

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
the third is to establish the value of

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,559
your community so what value are you

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,840
providing

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,520
that other programs don't and then

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,280
this isn't the ambassador's full-time

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
job so it's really important to

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,679
communicate

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,120
exactly what they're going to be getting

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,120
out of being part of your program

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
and then figure out how you're going to

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
promote the program and get new

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
ambassadors into it

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,200
my best advice for this is to reach out

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,880
to people directly

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
not just those github contributors that

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,159
you already know

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
but we also reach out to users who have

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
written blog posts on us

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
people we meet at conferences who talk

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,880
to us about kong and tell us they're

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,880
using it

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
people really like to feel special and

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,320
invited and it doesn't hurt to ask

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
because at the end of the day you know

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,240
the worst thing they can do is say no

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,159
and then that might provide some really

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:51,840
useful feedback on how you can make your

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:54,000
program more compelling

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
so then when first starting out i like

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
to put these

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,279
key pieces in place the first is a

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
program overview

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
so this should outline what it means to

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,200
be an ambassador

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,520
what do they get out of it and how does

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,039
this benefit the greater community

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,039
and then as i said with the contributor

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,559
documentation this should be located in

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,919
some type of central location

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,600
like github or a community hub

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,360
requirements and expectations

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
um so i've said it a few times but

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,760
remember this isn't their full-time job

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
but you should still set clear

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
expectations prior to someone joining

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,880
the program

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,919
whether that's maybe one blog post per

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,679
quarter hosting two meetups per year

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,400
you know how much time should they

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,039
expect to be contributing to this role

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
and then what happens if they don't or

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,559
they're unable to meet those

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,720
requirements at any point

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,840
code of conduct so these people are

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,080
going to be acting

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
on behalf of your organization or

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,520
project

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,880
and working within a diverse community

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,880
of individuals

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
so that code of conduct helps create a

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
welcoming community

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
and also sets forth the values that you

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
want community representatives to adhere

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,320
by

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,760
it also provides documentation in case a

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
complaint is issued against an

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,840
individual

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,840
to respond appropriately to that

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,840
and then resources and training um if

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,039
you're expecting ambassadors to go out

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,559
and be talking about your

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,559
your project they need to know what

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
they're talking about so we like to

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,600
provide

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,000
content for them um for presentations in

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,760
the form of slides recordings demos that

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,240
they can use

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,159
we also do monthly calls where we can

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:43,840
familiarize them on what's new in the

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,840
technology and help train them on it

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
so then there's some additional elements

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
in the day-to-day management of the

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,760
program

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,640
as well so the first is the application

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,880
process

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,799
and i typically suggest here to figure

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,640
out the lowest barrier to entry

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,159
um for us and i've seen for most open

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
source projects it tends to be something

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
like a google form

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,000
um one thing to keep in mind with this

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,919
is that can't be accessed everywhere

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,039
so if that's the case for the tool that

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,120
you choose

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,880
make sure that you do document some type

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,480
of alternative process

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
in countries where this might be blocked

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
on that application we also ask

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,240
ambassadors what they're interested in

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
so for example do they want to write or

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,799
speak

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,480
some people don't want to get up on a

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
stage in front of people and talk

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
and then some people also don't want to

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
write blog posts

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,919
so this lets us tailor the opportunities

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,360
to an ambassador's individual interest

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,320
so if i have a speaking opportunity

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,679
coming up

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,679
maybe i'll reach out to an ambassador

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,760
who loves to speak um

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,360
versus reaching out to someone uh for a

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,360
blog post who likes to do that

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
and then after that it's time to set up

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
review sessions with the decision making

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
committee and decide a couple of things

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,080
how many applications can you reasonably

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,799
accept within the program

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,320
um this may be due to you know bandwidth

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,559
constraints budget constraints

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,400
anything like that what are the

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,919
admissions periods going to be

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
and then what qualifies someone for

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
acceptance

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
having these clear review cycles and

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
status updates

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
helps sets expectations for the

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,919
community

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,360
as to when they'll receive a response so

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
this can help mitigate some of that

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,760
disappointment

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,360
if they're not selected during that

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
round because the process and

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,720
expectations are clear

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,559
onboarding so i like to give a variety

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,080
of onboarding options that

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,720
cater to different people's preferred

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,640
learning and communication styles

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
i typically start off with a detailed

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,279
welcome email which is basically

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
everything you need to know to get

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,039
started

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,520
um reiterate the role expectations and

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,880
code of conduct

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,559
then i also like to do a monthly

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,399
onboarding call so

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,480
this helps ambassadors get to know you

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,559
and other ambassadors as well

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,320
it's also really great to meet face to

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,760
face when all of us are working remotely

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,679
in the community

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,279
um especially when you're first starting

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,200
out so you're not just a stranger behind

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,000
an email

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,840
and then onboarding decks so i like to

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
detail all of this information in an

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,039
onboarding deck as well it's a lot to

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,120
take in all at once

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,480
so then ambassadors can just go back and

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
reference that

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
anytime they need a refresher on that

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,640
information

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
monthly ambassador meetings so these are

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,480
a great way to get everyone together

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,399
for both networking and learning um

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,159
monthly tends to be the best cadence for

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,320
communities i've worked with

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,840
um but this can be as often as you'd

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,799
like

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,600
so for cncf we did this exclusive for

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,080
ambassadors

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,919
it was really a mixture of project

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,200
updates as well as knowledge share so

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,559
that knowledge share could be something

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,559
like sharing meetup

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,559
best practices for organizing meetups

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,440
the for kong we do a community call

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,399
so this is not specific to kong

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,799
champions but for the whole community

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,360
we do demos from community members on

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,399
open source technology outside of kong

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,240
um and then we do do kong project

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,200
updates and demos from the engineering

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,960
team

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,440
including sneak peeks on upcoming

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
releases

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,320
and then day-to-day communication so we

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,679
are working in a global community

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
so i really like to make sure that we

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
have clear channels for communication

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,159
um not just channels for updates but

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,840
also to make sure that ambassadors can

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,200
connect with each other as well really

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,039
easily

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,440
this can be things like a private or

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,080
public slack channel for the ambassadors

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,640
an email alias with everyone on it and

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,960
then

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
a github repository so for information

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,600
that requires

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,399
that level of transparency and

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,399
accountability

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,039
and then special perks and benefits so

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
we talked about what we do for

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,240
contributors

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,080
but i'm also always thinking of ways to

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
to remind our ambassadors that we really

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,880
appreciate what they're doing for the

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,159
community

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,000
so ambassador swag um this identifies

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,279
them as a community resource

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,919
and recognizes them for their

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,200
contributions so this is something like

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,799
a vester jacket or a hat with a special

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,480
ambassador logo or badge on it

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,720
front row keynote seating is something

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,840
we started doing at cncf for kubecon

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
face-to-face meetups so um doing a happy

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,559
hour

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,240
a breakfast or some type of reception at

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,120
in-person events

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,120
um to provide really that vip experience

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,039
and get everyone to meet face to face

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,520
um there's only so many opportunities

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,960
for that throughout the year

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,120
obviously during the last year we have

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,320
been all virtual so we've pivoted to

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,520
doing these as

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,159
virtual community coffee hours for folks

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,760
a couple other examples are free access

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,159
to exams and workshops

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,640
so cncf ambassadors get to take the

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,159
certified kubernetes exams at no cost to

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,760
them

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
and then if your ambassadors are

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,519
organizing meetups or local user groups

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,480
you can do things like meetup

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,039
reimbursement

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,080
or um sponsorships if that's something

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,039
that fits into your

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,039
strategy and budget

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,039
and then i do want to add that there

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,159
really needs to be active program

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,679
management

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,360
you don't want to get a bunch of people

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,880
into your ambassador program with all of

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,880
these great promises

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,799
and then not have someone available to

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,840
actively manage and communicate with

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,840
them day to day

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
all right so now that we've talked about

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,840
putting all these programs together

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,120
let's talk about how to measure and

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
communicate their success

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,159
so at the end of the day we want to make

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,799
sure that the programs we're putting

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,039
together

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,159
are successful so that we can invest our

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,960
time and resources

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,480
in the most impactful ways but with

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,559
community programs

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,480
the value can oftentimes be really

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,399
difficult to measure

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,840
so i like to focus on communicating the

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,120
value of programs

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,519
in ways that make sense

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,360
cross-functionally and also helps

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
educate stakeholders on the value of

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,840
these programs

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,960
so a few ways i do this are the first

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,799
one i have on here

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,279
if possible this is not necessarily a

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,120
fit for every project or community

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,000
but you can choose a metric that exists

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,080
across teams to unify the language

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,840
so for example if you are in an

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,360
organization where you're working a lot

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,039
with sales and marketing

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,240
the term leads and prospects is

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,240
universally recognized

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,559
if a universal metric doesn't exist or

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,159
maybe it's not appropriate for the way

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,480
you're trying to measure and communicate

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,640
the value of community

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,640
i like to educate leadership on the

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,080
community terminology that you do want

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
to use

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,240
it's really helpful here to provide a

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,399
couple different measurement options

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,679
and then choose one or two of those

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,960
metrics max

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,720
to align on to measure success

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,799
the benefit of this that i like is that

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
it keeps things really streamlined

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,000
so leadership can focus on the high

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
level success

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,840
without getting bogged down in too many

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
of the day-to-day specifics

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,919
but you're going to want to know those

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,640
specifics for your own optimizations

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,799
um so you'll still want to determine

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
which of those program specific metrics

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,159
that you'll track

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,399
personally to provide that more detailed

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,840
view into your community efforts

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,559
and i'll dive into some examples of that

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,559
on the next slide

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,480
okay so for example you would choose

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,679
one or two of these growth metrics from

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
the first column

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,679
to report up to leadership to

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,519
communicate the overall growth and

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,799
success of your holistic community

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,120
efforts

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,120
so some examples of this could be the

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,600
sum of total community members

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,039
across all community channels with that

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,039
growth tracked over time

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,200
there's also tools out there like orbit

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
which allows you to connect all of your

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,720
community channels and automates this

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,720
tracking for you

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,399
so you can look at things like monthly

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
active users

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,679
growth of total monthly community

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,839
activities

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,159
um you know how if someone posts on

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,720
slack if someone responds to a discourse

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,240
post

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:23,040
things like that new versus returning

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,240
community members or even something like

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,440
growth of total

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,440
total users overall

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
then for your personal tracking i like

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,760
to keep track of both

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,520
quality and quantity here it's really

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,599
easy to measure the output of what

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
ambassadors or contributors are doing

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
but that doesn't really give you a great

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,960
view of the impact

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,800
so i like to measure impact of that when

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,760
possible

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,240
and some examples of this are these next

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,240
two

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,599
columns so growth of the number of

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,560
ambassador applications

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,920
and then how many of those are

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,920
converting to ambassadors

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,200
the number of blog posts written by

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,359
ambassadors

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,839
um but then i more so like to actually

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,320
measure the number of unique blog post

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,520
views

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,359
on that content so with that blog post

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,119
how many individuals are we reaching

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,760
with it

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,560
meet up attendance so i like to do this

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,680
almost as

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,480
a cpm model um so for example that would

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,040
be basically

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,960
how much did it cost to get in front of

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,359
x number of people

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,960
so the cost to send the ambassador

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,480
divided by the number of people there

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,240
if you're doing things like trade shows

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,240
and stuff as well it's great to be able

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,480
to set a baseline to compare to those

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,680
programs for example

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,520
oh sorry and cost per cpm basically cost

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,760
per number of impressions

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:59,839
so basically cost per number of people

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:59,839
that attended that meetup

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,880
um so then um

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,880
attendance and views of ambassador

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,400
presentations at meetups or conferences

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
so again number of people that attended

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
that meetup or maybe

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,560
views of the presentation if it's

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,560
recorded after the fact

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,599
and then downloads and signups this is

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,200
really my ideal way to measure it if you

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,400
do have the setup in place

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,040
to be able to attribute your efforts to

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,800
downloads and signups but this can be

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,440
really incredibly difficult to do with

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,560
open source

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,920
then for contributor programs basically

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,040
growth of number of

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,079
active contributors over time then

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,079
issues and prs

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,800
so this is more about tracking the

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,200
health and activity of your project

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
so things like how many open open issues

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,320
and prs

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,920
how many closed and then what is the

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
time to close those out

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,280
so this can tell you how active your

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,119
contributors are and then how quickly

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
your maintainers are able to respond to

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,880
them

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,839
um and then the last two are similar to

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,800
what we talked about under the

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,800
ambassador section

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,240
okay so that's all i have for today we

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,680
really covered a lot of ground here so

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,000
i'm happy to take the rest of the time

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,079
to answer any questions that folks have

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,760
um you can drop them in the chat and q a

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,760
and i'll go through there

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
um and then just afterwards as well i'm

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
always available

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,480
via twitter or email if you have any

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,480
questions that come up after the fact

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,839
all right so one of the questions do you

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
typically have only one community

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,000
manager

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,240
or as you grow do you need more

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,520
resources

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,520
so um

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,640
so it depends on the size

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,480
of your community

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,200
and depending on how many projects are

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,560
under your umbrella so

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,440
right now at clong we have um four

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,640
open source projects and that's i'm

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,240
really talking about the biggest ones

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,760
that we have we have some smaller

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,720
projects as well

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,680
um my team is a team of three and then

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,880
we have

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,200
a um our counterparts on devrel which

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,240
should

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,200
be a team of five by the end of the year

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,560
i typically try to try to recommend one

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,839
community manager

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,040
per open source project um i touched on

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,240
it a little bit in the ambassador

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,800
section

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,520
but it's just really important to have

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,640
someone that's

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,320
able to actively answer questions from

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,640
the community and engage

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,920
and if it's less than that it's really

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,839
hard to keep up with

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,839
um with the traffic there typically

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,680
um there's a link in my presentation yes

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
let me figure out which one that is and

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,839
i

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,839
will drop that in the chat

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,839
yep and then um oh sorry i stopped

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:28,720
sharing so i could find the link in here

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:31,839
all right that's okay

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,640
okay just drop that link

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,720
into the chat i will also respond

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,880
directly to your question so you can see

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,520
that

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,359
um so yes so one of the other comments

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,960
in here slash questions is it feels like

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,440
some of these suggestions would depe

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,520
would depend on the size of the project

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,440
um absolutely like a small like you said

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,359
a small project wouldn't necessarily

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,200
need um an ambassador program

00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,520
i think one of the best ways to decide

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,440
once your project is the right size to

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,960
take it to the next level

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,960
is one do you have that

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,640
active pool of contributors and users

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,760
that you can pull from

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,839
um and i think at that point it doesn't

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
quite matter how big or how small your

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,800
project

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
is if you have those active people that

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,079
are willing to go out and advocate on

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,079
behalf of your project

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,640
and a lot of this the time this can

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:30,319
happen really organically

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,960
um and then the second thing

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,839
would be the point at which it kind of

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,640
grows

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,640
beyond um the bandwidth that you have on

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,280
your own team to support

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,960
so ambassadors are a great extension of

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,680
your internal

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,640
um team as well so this can also depend

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
on whether you're

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,640
you know an organized organization

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,359
backed open source project

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,119
versus you know an organic open source

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,520
project that's completely

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,720
supported by the community but

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:07,599
ambassadors can be a really great

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:09,599
extension of your internal team there

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,960
and please let me know if um you know

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,280
that answers your question as well i'm

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:21,839
happy to expand on any of that

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:21,839
as well

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,520
um we have a few more minutes just in

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
case anybody has more questions

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,040
and then i just wanted to share my

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,560
screen again so you could see um my

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,359
twitter and email as well if anything

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,079
else comes up

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,880
afterwards and we also have a raised

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,319
hand

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,040
and did you see that one as well

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,319
can probably let them unmute to talk or

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,319
something

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,839
or they can touch they can talk in the

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,839
chat if you prefer that

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
yeah i have never used the allow to chat

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,839
all right let's try this

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,520
you should have the option to let them

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,839
unmute um

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,760
you should be able to do that if not i

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,319
can do for you

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,160
if that's great maria i've tested it out

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,240
with you

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,200
awesome hi thank you so much for your

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,599
presentation i i really appreciate it um

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,280
it was a it's always good to see how

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,839
other people think about this

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,800
and um i i was wondering if you

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,280
ever had to design a community program

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,480
where

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,800
you have different types of activities

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,480
based on the goals that you had for that

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,359
program so for example

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,480
if you want to increase use uh do you do

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,960
a specific thing

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,079
versus if you want to increase uh the

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,079
number of contributors

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,119
yep um definitely and i alluded a little

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,680
bit to this

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,200
in one of the first few slides in here

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,880
um some of the stuff i talked about with

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,440
the contributor program

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,560
um can kind of relate to what what

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,640
you're asking

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,000
so for increasing use i focus a lot more

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,200
on the um awareness

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,839
and onboarding aspect of it so things

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,119
like content around how to use the

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,599
project

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,040
or a really solid onboarding experience

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,400
to get new users ramped up and started

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,440
versus maybe if you aren't looking for

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,839
new users

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,680
per se you're looking for more um

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,640
kind of awareness engagement in the

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,640
community i'd focus more on

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,560
the ambassador program to build up that

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,240
advocacy component

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,960
um those are kind of the two big

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
examples that i

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,839
that i have awesome

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,839
thank you

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:09,839
awesome all right

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,839
all right jm i think i've allowed you to

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,119
talk

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:26,960
sorry i don't

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,960
can you hear us you can unmute

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,760
all right

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,440
um feel free to raise your hand again

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,720
and i'll promote you otherwise i'll get

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,720
back to some of these other questions

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
what do you suggest to keep a user group

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
active amidst

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,640
busy schedules of organizers so this is

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,680
a great question and actually

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,839
something that we're doing right now

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,160
um the way that we're doing this at kong

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,440
we have 93 user groups

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,720
um across the world and we

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,079
are trying to ramp this up internally

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,160
first with support

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
before we hand this over to community

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,520
organizers

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,200
so they will receive the support of the

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,839
kong marketing team

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,720
and then once we are able to hand this

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,040
over to

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,240
um you know individual group organizers

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
we're going to provide them with

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,160
basically a meet up in a box

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,839
so all of the information that they need

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,240
to set up the meetup

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,040
um kind of speakers and talks that we

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,880
have that they

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,319
can can choose from they're always

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,520
welcome to come up with their own but

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,200
just to make the

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,359
lift really easy on them to give them

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,960
the resources that they can

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,839
and then we do try to provide them with

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,280
someone on the team who can answer any

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,040
questions

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,400
help set up groups if they need it any

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:49,200
type of administrative tasks

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,839
the other thing i suggest here is if

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,160
you're running into this a lot

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,440
set some type of expectation for the

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,680
group organizers

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,880
so if you know they're really not active

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,520
making it a requirement of hosting one

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,880
user group per quarter let's say that

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,760
might be a little much but

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,920
making sure that there's some

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,680
requirement for them to remain active to

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,560
remain a user group

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,560
um under your kind of project umbrella

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,800
would you say that a single team member

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,319
can own community and ambassador

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,839
programs for an org

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,920
um yes because i have done this

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,119
um i would say i really do prefer to

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,800
have um

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,240
you know two people here depending on

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,680
the size of your community but

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,720
especially as you're getting it off the

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,640
ground

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,800
um i do think that a single community

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,839
member can own both of these things

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,440
um it also tends to make it kind of a

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,319
natural progression for

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,240
once the community um requirements

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,599
exceed that one person's bandwidth

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,040
that's typically a good indicator to

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,040
hire on a second person as well

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,119
all right

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
all right well it looks like it's quiet

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,800
now

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,440
and thank you so much kathleen and it

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,280
was a very

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,079
brilliant session with you and thank you

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,200
so much for all your time

00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah thank you thank you so much

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,839
