00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,519
world um

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,480
and yeah i'm just gonna jump right in

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,439
so as todd said uh my name is your eye

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
masterpiece

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
i am an engineering manager over at the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
new york times

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
and todd did a great job of uh giving

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
you a little bit of background for why

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
i'm here today but i'm gonna

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
just give a little bit more context uh

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
to

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,879
set the set the scene a bit

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,680
a few years ago i

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
created an open source project a tool

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,320
that i called chronicler

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,440
and when i was first starting off i

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,879
had no idea how to actually

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,520
go about open source

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,479
um probably feels very familiar to most

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,720
of us here today

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,400
and i can say very confidently that

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,520
that's a totally natural feeling

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,119
i myself was very lost so in order to

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,759
figure out how i could put my project

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,840
out into the world

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,119
i went ahead and i googled

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,560
probably something that all of you are

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
very familiar with certainly something

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
that i do every day

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
i went ahead and i googled how can i

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,280
make a great open source project

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,000
and after a little bit of research i put

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
a bunch of

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
disparate pieces together for how i

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,680
could successfully put my project out

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
into the world

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,880
and after i finally got it all together

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
and pushed it all up to github

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,640
i decided to write about my experience

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,720
open sourcing my first project

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
and i ended up coming out with a blog

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,479
post titled how to take your open source

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
project from good to great

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,220
this is the one that todd was alluding

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,479
to

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,719
[Music]

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,720
was shared in the chat it's a beginner's

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,920
guide for how you can create a great

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
open source project

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
all of it is based on my own research

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
conversations with my colleagues and

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
friends

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,360
and generally just my experience at the

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,239
time both

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,920
using different open source projects and

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,599
throughout the process of figuring out

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,599
how i can make my own project great

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,640
now that was published back in 2019

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
and looking back on it now on march 30th

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,360
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,319
that was approximately 1 000 years ago

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
and truthfully a lot of that a lot of

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
what i wrote

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,080
still holds up so i definitely encourage

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,599
you to go read it especially if you want

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
to take a look at some of the resources

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,040
that i have available

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
and any other quick tips that might be

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
helpful for you

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,760
as you go along your journey the

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
general takeaway for my blog post is

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,440
that there are a lot of ways

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
that you can take your open source

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
project from good to great i wrote about

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
a few that i thought were important and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
today

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
no doubt you're going to learn plenty

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
more ways that you can take your open

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,720
source project to the next level

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
in the sessions later on

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,080
but for this session i want to focus on

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
something that was

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
missing from that blog post focus on

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
something that

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,360
i've been learning more and more of over

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
the last few years of my career

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
and something that i somehow always come

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
back to as one of the most important

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
things that i do

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
in my work day today

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
one of the absolute most impactful ways

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
that you can take your open source

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
project

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,959
from good to great is to focus

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,000
on community community

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,159
is the heart of open source

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
it's what drives us to volunteer our

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
time and our energy

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,799
to projects that can be used by

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,439
thousands more it

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
prompts us to become better teachers and

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,560
enables

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
us to always learn new things

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,599
it's honestly what brings us here

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,680
together today at an online conference

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,799
without a strong sense of community

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
there would be no

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,680
open source 101 conference and without

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
the thousands of communities out there

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,799
today

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,799
there would be no open source at all

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
just like i said in my in my original

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
blog post

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
there are a lot of ways that you can

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
focus on community

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,080
while open sourcing your work

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
today i'm really just going to focus on

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
a few quick tactical tips that i've

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
picked up along the way

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
and they're going to center around being

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,520
welcoming

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,080
being inclusive helping others to learn

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
and helping others to contribute and

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
again these are just the four

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,840
cornerstones that i'm going to focus on

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
today to get you started on thinking

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
about how you can build a community

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,199
around your own open source projects

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
but there are actually a few other

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
sessions later on that will focus more

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,280
deeply on community

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
so i highly encourage you to check those

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
out

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
so to start it off let's talk about

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
being welcoming

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
we want our community to be open and

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,320
welcoming and this is going to help

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,440
newcomers feel at home and contributors

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,479
keep coming back

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
to continue helping your cause first

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
impressions

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
honestly they are pretty long lasting so

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
do everything that you can

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,720
to make folks feel welcome when they

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
first discover your project

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
one of the best places to do this is

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
probably your readme file

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,919
it's the first page your users will see

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,440
and it usually houses a ton of important

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,199
information so they're going to be there

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
anyway

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
if you address your users and your

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
contributors and your readme file

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,039
it's one small step that goes a really

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
long way in creating a sense of

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
belonging

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
you can add your motivations for the

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
project in your readme

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
you can describe who the project serves

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
and add any values or principles that

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,120
help guide you as you work towards

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
your ultimate goal

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,960
this can give your community something

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,479
to come together on and it helps

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,840
motivate everyone to keep making

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,840
progress forward together

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,080
your readme is also a great place to

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
express gratitude

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,840
you can thank newcomers for coming to

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
visit in the first place and you can

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,800
show some love to the different

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,680
contributors that help make your project

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
everything that it is

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
the all contributor spec and the

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
supporting tools around it

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
makes it really easy to celebrate all

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
kinds of contributors for their help

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
and this even goes beyond engineering

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
support

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,639
it includes recognition for translations

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,199
bug filing documentation writing design

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
help

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,960
and a lot of other contribution types

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,000
you can also just add some names to an

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,479
author's

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,560
markdown file the open source sinatra

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,240
has a really great example in their

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,120
authors file

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
they personally and very specifically

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,199
think

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
many of the project's main contributors

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
if your project is small enough you can

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,440
definitely find ways to personally thank

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
your contributors

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,199
but even as it grows don't forget to

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
give don't forget to give thanks to the

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
folks that help keep your project and

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
community going

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,800
making people feel welcome and valued is

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
a key part to a strong sense of

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
community

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
there are simple ways to accomplish this

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
like the ones that i shared here

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
but you know don't be afraid to put your

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
own spin on a welcome wagon

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
committee that's maybe right for your

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
project could be anything

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,039
the next pillar of a great community is

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
inclusivity

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
you want to emphasize the importance of

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,599
kindness and mutual respect

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,800
in all aspects of what community members

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
do

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
and again you want this to be in your

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,199
readme file or

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
somewhere equally prominent

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,199
be as intentional and thoughtful about

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,000
the culture you're trying to fail

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,000
good culture does not happen by accident

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,360
you need to cultivate it and nurture it

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
into what you want it to be

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
make sure you're being specific about

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
how best to give

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,400
feedback in code review or how to keep

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,479
discussions cordial and productive

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,839
a code of conduct helps to reinforce the

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,080
culture that you're trying to build

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
and it's one of the small it's one small

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,839
part of creating a space that is safe

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,839
and welcoming for all people

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
now i found this tweet last night from

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
josh simmons and he's giving the talk

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
right after me

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,200
hey josh uh i found it and i was like

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,240
well i gotta put this in my talk

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,080
and the tweet is your community is only

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,519
as good as the worst behavior it

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,279
tolerates

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
and it's so accurate that i absolutely

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
needed to share it

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,760
your code of conduct will make it very

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
clear what kind of behavior is expected

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
and what kind of behavior is absolutely

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,279
not tolerated

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,800
when participating in your community

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
it's an extension of your

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
open source and community values and the

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,320
principles and you should use it to help

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
protect your community from harm

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
if you need some inspiration for codes

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
of conduct to adopt

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,720
here's one the contributor covenant is a

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
really well respected and frequently

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
adopted code of conduct

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
that you can make your own so please

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,279
check it out if you ever

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
feel stuck on what direction to take

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,240
your code of conduct in

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
or you can pull inspiration from

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
existing organizations and their codes

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
of conduct

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,720
like the one that open source 101 has

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
make sure that you're recognizing and

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
celebrating the fact that your community

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
is made up of

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,320
people from all walks of life it's

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
better for it it's stronger for it

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
people from different backgrounds

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
experience levels race ethnicities

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,959
religions nationalities all coming

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
together to work on a project that means

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,040
something to you all

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,040
and binds you all together

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,600
having a diverse community again doesn't

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
come for free and it doesn't happen by

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
accident

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,120
and honestly it's no secret that the

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
tech and open source fields have been

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
particularly toxic

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,160
uh for folks belonging to minority and

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,079
marginalized groups

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
so make sure you're putting in the work

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,519
to make your community one that is safe

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,959
and welcoming for everyone

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,079
especially those that have been

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
historically left out

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
now i want to add a really quick note

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
here because i think it's so important

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
to get

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,560
this point across the dual topics of

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,760
diversity and inclusion are

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,360
a whole talk a course a profession in

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
and of itself

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,399
it's one that demands and deserves

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,200
thoughtful

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,160
and intentional i add it here quickly

00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
not

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
to thinking that this is a quick tip to

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
add to your checklist

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
but to underscore the importance of the

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,240
importance of it

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
and urge you to give it the time and

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
focus it needs

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,839
a sense of belonging in your community

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,519
can really distinguish you from the many

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,640
other projects a user contributor can

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
spend their time on

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,760
so take this to heart and commit to

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,079
making your community

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,079
experiences feel open safe and

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,040
supportive

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
no matter what your experience level if

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
you're

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,279
brand new to programming or you have

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,959
years of experience under your belt

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,560
everyone is going to need a little extra

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,160
help at some point

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
and having a supportive learning

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
environment is going to attract folks

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
from all different levels

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,399
and enable them to grow along with your

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,399
project

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
documentation can make or break your

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
project so

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,279
take extra care to write documentation

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,160
that is accessible

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,160
understandable and easy to discover

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,240
besides your readme file and maybe

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,279
besides a documentation site

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,519
consider creating tutorials walkthroughs

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
examples these will all really help

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,120
people learn both quickly and

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,120
deeply and remember there is a person at

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
the other end of your documentation

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
you can help them succeed in learning by

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,160
keeping your docs

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
up to date and as helpful as possible

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,920
you also want to set up channels of

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
communication where people can come

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
together

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
and ask questions and learn from each

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,320
other

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
things like slack discord and irc

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,839
channels are

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,560
perfect for these kinds of asynchronous

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,720
conversations

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,639
but also consider things like video

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,320
conference video calls or conference

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,200
calls to bring community members

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
together

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,240
in real life these can be open office

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
hours to ask questions they can be

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
meetups to learn new topics or

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,680
really just time to come together and

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
discuss the future of the project

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
this is me back in 2018 when i first

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
published chronicler you probably can't

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,639
recognize me because of all the hair but

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,760
i promise that's me uh

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,160
i when i first published it i decided to

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,240
speak at a conference or at the meetup

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,639
that the new york times was hosting

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,560
i shared my chronicler experiences with

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the group and i explained how they could

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
help by contributing code to the project

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
and i also encourage them to reach out

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
online or in person if they ever needed

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,880
any help

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
taking a personal approach really helps

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,560
to build a human connection

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
and it helps your project and your

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,040
community to go way

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
beyond just the code

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
building a culture of learning and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
learning building a culture of learning

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
in your community

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,600
helps bring people together and create

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,680
strong human connections

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
there's plenty that you can do to help

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
your users and your contributors

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,560
become more fluent and confident in your

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
particular project

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,160
so always be on the lookout for how you

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
can enable your community to do their

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
best work

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
the last pillar of your great open

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
source community

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,440
is making sure you're helping others

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,680
contribute to your project

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,000
you want to make it super easy for folks

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,839
to participate in your community

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,480
to encourage them to do so and to get

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,000
started very quickly

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,480
make sure that you have a contributing

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
doc this is going to tell folks how they

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
can get started

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,079
where they can jump in and how they can

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
reach out for help

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,399
honestly it can be pretty intimidating

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,760
for a newcomer to land on a project

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,760
that they're really excited to

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
participate in and have absolutely no

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,160
idea where to start i'm sure

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,000
many of us here today have felt that at

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,199
some point or another or will feel that

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
in the future

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
so try to make a habit of labeling

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
different issues

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
based on how difficult they might be to

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,160
tackle and make it especially clear when

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
a task would be suited best for

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,800
beginners

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
you can see here on the react codebase

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,760
they have a label specifically for all

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,639
open issues

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,320
that are approachable and easy enough

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,600
for beginners to take on

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,959
you'll see it under the the green label

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
called good first issue this kind of

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
labeling

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,600
really helps encourage new contributors

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,199
to submit their own work and helps to

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,519
grow your community at all different

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,519
levels

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
again a personal touch can really go a

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,920
long way

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,760
pairing closely with contributors and

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,759
helping them to fix bugs

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,759
or getting them to take on bigger

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
projects can really help build up

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,079
a lot of confidence in them in a short

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,079
amount of time

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,079
and lastly it takes a village to keep a

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,720
great open source project

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,560
especially one with a vibrant community

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
find ways to bring more people into the

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
fold

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
this could be by inviting frequent

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
contributors to join you as maintainers

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
and then mentoring them to take on more

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
and more responsibilities

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,199
maintaining your open source project

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
will not always be easy

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,120
and it'll be especially hard in the

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
beginning when you're first starting off

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,920
on your own

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,920
so the faster you can get folks to

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,600
contribute the easier it's going to be

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,600
to share the responsibility

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
of maintaining a great project

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,000
as i said at the top of this talk there

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
are a ton of ways for you to take your

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
open source project

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
from good to great focusing on community

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,320
is just one of them

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
but i think it's one of the most

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,880
important and valuable ones that you can

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
spend your time on

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,680
ultimately building a great community

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079
comes down to keeping people at the

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
center

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,680
of your work whether you're writing

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,160
documentation

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,519
hosting meetups building up processes

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
around code review

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,639
or setting up continuous integration

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
pipelines

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
think about how best to serve the people

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
in your community

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,079
if you do this and take it to heart

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,959
you'll almost certainly take your open

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,160
source project

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
