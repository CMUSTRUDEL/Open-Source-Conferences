Description: 
	Joel Lord, Developer Advocate at Red Hat OpenShift, delivered the talk "Containerization for Software Developers" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 20, 2021.

Abstract:
The end is nigh. Your application is almost ready, and you will need to deploy it. And with the deployment, the endless tweaking to get everything running on your production servers. If only there were a way to test everything first. That is where containers will come in to save the day. With containers, you not only run your code in an environment similar to the production server, but you also run your code in precisely the same environment. In this talk, the attendees will learn about how to create container friendly applications, how to use containers to share their code with their team and finally, how to use those same containers to deploy to a production server with minimal efforts.
