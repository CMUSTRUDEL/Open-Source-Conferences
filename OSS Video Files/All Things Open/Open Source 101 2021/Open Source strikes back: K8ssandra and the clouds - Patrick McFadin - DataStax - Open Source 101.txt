Description: 
	Patrick McFadin, VP of Developer Relation at DataStax, delivered the talk "Open Source strikes back: K8ssandra and the clouds" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
We’ve been hearing how the big clouds will be the end of Open Source for years. News of that demise may be a bit premature. There are some new trends that put Open Source back in the disruptive seat. By way of an example, I’ll use my first-hand involvement with the K8ssandra project and show how Kubernetes is changing the economics of Open Source Software yet again. The commodity pricing of computing and storage is driving an entirely new definition of “Free as in Freedom”, and as a result, the stage is set for a lot of great things for years to come. If you are new to Open Source and thought it was just about running free software on your laptop, let me open the door to a lot more possibilities.
