Title: Open Source strikes back: K8ssandra and the clouds - Patrick McFadin - DataStax - Open Source 101
Publication date: 2021-04-10

Description: 
	Patrick McFadin, VP of Developer Relation at DataStax, delivered the talk "Open Source strikes back: K8ssandra and the clouds" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
We’ve been hearing how the big clouds will be the end of Open Source for years. News of that demise may be a bit premature. There are some new trends that put Open Source back in the disruptive seat. By way of an example, I’ll use my first-hand involvement with the K8ssandra project and show how Kubernetes is changing the economics of Open Source Software yet again. The commodity pricing of computing and storage is driving an entirely new definition of “Free as in Freedom”, and as a result, the stage is set for a lot of great things for years to come. If you are new to Open Source and thought it was just about running free software on your laptop, let me open the door to a lot more possibilities.

hi everyone

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,280
i'm patrick mcfadden i do

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
a lot of things at data stacks primarily

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,839
i work on open source projects

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
i've been working with the patchy

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,880
cassandra project for

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
quite a few years uh more years

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
probably about 10 years i'll just say it

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
10 years

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
since it was an early project lately

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
i've been working a lot with kubernetes

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
and a project called kate sander which

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,600
i'll talk about pretty soon

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,320
um just spending a lot of my my career

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
my my background and career is in

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
running on

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
open source infrastructure i've been

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,039
doing uh

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,039
internet infrastructure for a long time

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,520
and open source has always been a part

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,680
of it

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
and has been a really strong part of my

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
career

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
so i feel pretty passionate about this

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,320
topic um

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
i've given talks before on the business

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,879
of open source

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,000
um how open source licensing works uh my

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,040
i was a mainstay at open uh oz con

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,439
if uh if any of you had ever gone there

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
pour one out for pearl dos con i'm sad

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
to say there will never be another one

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,680
but we have great open source

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
conferences like open source 101 and all

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
things open

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
i think we're going to keep going but

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,439
let's just get into this so

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
my my talk today is going to be a bit of

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,840
a story

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,000
hopefully you'll enjoy it but there's

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
something moral of this story

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,439
so star wars fans out there

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
a long time ago in a data center far far

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
away

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,799
and i think this is uh this is when the

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,240
music starts right

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,119
well here's the sad music uh

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
it's kind of grim times right now and

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,200
when i say grim

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
times there's just a lot of bad press

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
going around about you know the demise

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,840
of open source

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,960
and i'm sure you've seen this this is

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,079
the whole idea that

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,399
uh the clouds are strip mining and this

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
is

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,759
i put it in air quotes but it's actually

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,879
in quotes on my presentation

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,200
strip mining the open source projects

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,360
and

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
what that means what strip mining means

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,239
is that they're taking

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,120
um all the good stuff and wrecking the

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,879
the ecosystem or you know i think that's

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
where that came from is that

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
it just takes all the resources and

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,480
leaves this horrible bear and landscape

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,239
and what it really comes down to is

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
you know that there's a lot of open

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
source projects out there

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,160
that um have made an enormous mark

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
on our open source infrastructure or our

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,440
infrastructure in general

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,160
and there's feeling like the mariad ceo

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
saying

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
basically this is ruining open source

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
because they're taking

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
and they're not giving back there's no

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,239
one contributing to

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,400
mariadb uh which was in this article

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
um and even to the point where like

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
elastic has very famously been

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
uh going after amazon with changing

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
their license terms and

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
even considering suing them it's getting

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,159
pretty serious right

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,159
and and then amazon has been

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
trying to wave this flag is like no no

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
we're just as open source as you are

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,319
which is different

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,280
and so this is a war going on a

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,400
very cold war for sure but it's

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
happening

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
and you know there's a lot of folks that

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,519
are saying this could be the end of open

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
source

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,840
because what are you going to do when

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
you're just renting everything from a

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,440
cloud um

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,680
and i love this scene because uh

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,440
when you look at this you're like yeah

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,120
that doesn't look so good

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,040
but there was a prophecy and

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
uh i'm not here to say that this is

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
actually a privacy

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,000
um what i'm saying here is that we're

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,280
going to use history as a bit of a

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,159
teacher and i'm going to make you feel a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
little bit better

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
it's not going to look so bad when i'm

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,680
done with this

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
so going back in history there's always

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
been this

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,120
problem or this just trend

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,200
where relative cost of it infrastructure

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
always increases with scale it's very

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
fairly linear

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,920
and of course with um

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
with all of the you know the the

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,799
infrastructure we have to use to scale

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,079
up

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,880
um it's going to come with a cost and

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,479
it's repeated itself quite often

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
throughout history

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,720
technology just in general whenever we

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
have a little bit of it and it costs

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
a lot using a lot more starts reducing

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,160
the cost but there still is a linear

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,680
relationship over time

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,120
and we've seen this many times where

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
eventually they'll get to be an

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,000
inflection or a cut point

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
like the cost and the scale meet at a

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
certain point

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,600
where people aren't happy and

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
when that happens when that moment

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
occurs

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
we have to really stop and think okay

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,600
how how are we going to move forward

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,280
because

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
keeping the going up and to the right

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,600
continuously

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,919
is just not viable right now and so

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
that's when we find ourselves in as

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,680
smart engineers as we are

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
we come up with alternatives or we

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,479
change the equation

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
now this has happened over and over

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,280
again

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,360
so way back in a long time ago

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
um mainframes were the i.t

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
infrastructure at the time

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
but it cost millions and millions of

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
dollars if you just wanted to do a

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
little bit

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,880
and it just got out of control scale and

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
of course if you were a

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,759
huge bank or an insurance company sure

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,240
that made sense for a government agency

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
but the scale was not portable and it

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
did not work for

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
what needed to happen like in smaller

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,080
businesses for instance

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,919
um and so the client server computing

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,360
came along that was when we had

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,280
uh companies rose up like oracle um

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
that was when those started and then

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
eventually we got to the point where

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
client server because like companies

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,880
like sun

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,280
if you want to use their computer it's

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,160
big

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
and it's heavy and it's really expensive

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
um

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,280
internet changed a lot of that scale as

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,880
well so now we have commodity computing

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,919
um and virtual machines

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,479
and things like lamp stack that

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,520
really cheap like reset all the costs

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,680
again

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
and so you get the sawtooth pattern over

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
and over again

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,000
and then but we were still installing uh

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,120
our own infrastructure at the time and

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,160
so when we were doing um

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
all this great stuff like uh you know

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
like

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
building out these big massive websites

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,240
uh we were building our own data centers

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,479
as well

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
but eventually what happened was is that

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,400
um

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
we got into this cloud thing and that's

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
you know that reset thing

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
again we're no longer building data

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
centers and so

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
now we're in that mode this is where we

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
are that's why it's kind of fading right

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
now so where are we today

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,880
whoop and those heroes in

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
those that world centered around like

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
the

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
these projects that were starting to

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
band together in these tribes

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,199
like the apache software foundation the

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,400
linux foundation

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,840
i mean think about this it's like from

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,280
for the last 30 years at least uh

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,800
20 years in in real i mean the linux

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
foundation and apache software

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
foundation have been around a little

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,120
over 20 years

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,000
but in the past 30 years these are these

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
are projects

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
and foundations that have made a

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,039
remarkable difference

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
in how open source economics has

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,120
affected

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
it infrastructure and the relative costs

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,879
so

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,400
when we talk about open source we're

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,840
talking about the two things that are

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
pretty common that everyone talks about

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
there's a freeze in freedom and freezing

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,280
beer

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
and who doesn't like free beer right

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,319
that that's me on the right by the way

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,199
the very very far right

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
um i was at doing a uh conference in

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,400
munich

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,360
and found out that even though the beer

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,000
isn't free there it sure is awesome

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,599
um if you i can't wait to get past covid

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
so i can start traveling again

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,360
because i want to go back um but this

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
freeze of freedom freezing beer

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
two very distinctly different freedoms

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,279
right but

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,440
big impact on how we reset our economics

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
because freezing freedom means deploy

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
wherever you want

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
there's no license restrictions that say

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,519
oh well you can only deploy it on this

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,919
type of machine

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
like i used to work with a lot of sun

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,320
gear

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,480
and you didn't install sunos on

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
your commodity server no you had to have

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
a sun hardware

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
that was exactly as specified for that

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,480
piece of software

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,040
and so the license was not available for

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,680
me to run it on say an x86 machine

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
eventually we had solaris x86 but not

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,920
during

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,519
the 90s and so when linux comes along i

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,640
can deploy it anywhere i want

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
and as long as it runs x86 code it works

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,480
great

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
and then the license cost and i think

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
this is where most folks are like

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
yeah i mean that's great but is that

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,680
really why you're here

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,760
yeah it's a big reason come on i mean

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,839
when you download a piece of software

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
a world-class piece of software like i

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
said i work with apache cassandra

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,440
this is probably the most powerful

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,040
database in the world it runs everything

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
that you can think of from your cell

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,800
phone

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,440
to your entertainment to your banking

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
and the cost to you is a hundred percent

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
zero

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,480
now you can go with a company like data

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
stacks and we help you do a lot of with

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,800
cassandra but the bits the

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
core part of that is free and if you

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
want to download it from apache.org

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
it's up to you and you can run it

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
anywhere you want and that kind of

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,839
freedom

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
has enabled a lot of really interesting

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,680
things

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,760
let me give you an example facebook in

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,959
2008 and this is actually when i was

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,480
this is when i was working in

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
infrastructure i didn't work at facebook

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
but i was working at other companies in

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
silicon valley

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
and this was a crazy time for everybody

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
in open source

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,240
because where we were and what we were

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
doing

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,279
is was totally fueled by open source

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,480
so facebook in 2008 had 1800

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
my sequel servers um and

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
that was a lot uh in 2008 um i'm sure

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
there are companies that had similar

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
numbers

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,959
you know google has a lot of

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,920
infrastructure at the time

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,640
you know facebook was a hyperscaler and

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,519
then

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
uh i think uh myspace was also one of

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
those

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,160
yeah well not anymore but um youtube was

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,200
just starting to become a thing

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,120
and when you and twitter but

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
when you talk about 1800 my sequel

00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
servers

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
what are those running on well those are

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,399
running on eight core

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,800
servers and eight core servers um

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,720
means that now if i was to go to oracle

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
and say i would like to buy a license

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
for

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
say instead of my sequel i'm gonna run

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,079
oracle

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
and you could even license my sql if you

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,240
wanted to but let's say we're just going

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
to buy an

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,079
oracle server to run all of facebook

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,480
well the list price in 2008 was 50 000

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,279
per core and so eight cores each do the

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
math

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,839
that's 720 million dollars

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,720
and i think at the time uh facebook had

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,680
taken probably maybe 120 million dollars

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
in funding i think it was 150 and it was

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,399
just a lot of money

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,160
um and you know

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,959
yeah this is like extreme crazy example

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
but

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,120
it is what fueled facebook is not having

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
that overhead a cost

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
they bought some really great engineers

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
and

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,880
they rented them and they uh they spent

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
their money on people but their people

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
were moving the technology forward

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,240
now okay let's say that you got an 80

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,560
discount that's still 144 million

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
dollars worth of oracle licenses

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,560
facebook would not have done what they

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
did and by the way this is a snapshot in

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,800
2008 i remember

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
seeing um like in 2009 this number

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
almost doubled

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
because this is when they were in hyper

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,200
growth mode and

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,279
could you imagine like a weekly call to

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
your oracle rep i need to buy another 5

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,279
000 licenses you know

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
um boy that that rep would be really

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,399
exciting but

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,040
uh you know this is an example of

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
when open source was just the fuel

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,519
because

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
the meetings that they were having were

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
advancing technology

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
and what happened as a result of that is

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
that facebook actually started

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,320
not just using mysql but started

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
contributing to it greatly but also

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
building some really cool apache

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
projects

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,079
like cassandra cassandra came from

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,200
facebook around that time

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
and they they did a lot of work on hbs

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
and

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
on hadoop and presto

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,800
i mean they have a lot of contributions

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
now they're doing react so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
open source has benefited greatly from

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
that because they're just taking it to a

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,760
whole new scale

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,880
so let's go back to today and

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
where we are well

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,120
we are now doing this we're so i

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,000
replaced my my just

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,279
generic hand wavy uh here's cloud

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
infrastructure

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,959
and let me replace this with this which

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,760
is

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
cloud dollars in cloud usage and it's

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,360
going

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,320
up and to the right right now

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,279
and we don't really know where this is

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
going to go where

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
it's getting too expensive but i will

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,720
tell you this

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,240
it is getting expensive um and

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,639
just go out and look at how many

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
startups are out there that do

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,320
nothing but tell you how to spend less

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,279
on a cloud

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,480
so in that case you know i'd say we're

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,240
getting there i don't know what it's

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,279
going to take

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,560
but what do clouds really sell

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,279
they sell you three basic things every

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,199
cloud sells you these three things

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,160
which is compute network and storage

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,120
that's it now i know what you're going

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
to say

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
no they sell me a lot more than that but

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
no no

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
they this is fundamentally what they

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
sell

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and the reason that they sell that is

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,880
because they build these

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,920
this is a picture of amazon east i think

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,120
probably

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,839
one of the az's uh nice you know thanks

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
google earth

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
um and get a nice snapshot at the top of

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
the roof

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
but these these data centers and i used

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,199
to work in northern virginia

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,360
at data centers like this and if you go

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,680
through like places like ashburn

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
there's a lot of big buildings with no

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,600
windows

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,800
and really small parking lots and they

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
don't expect a lot of people to live

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,399
there and huge loading docks

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,560
and why because they're data centers and

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
these are really expensive to build

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
they're uh

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
somewhat expensive to maintain they

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,240
require a lot of

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,920
specialty power like redundancy

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
they have cooling requirements you see

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
all those units on the top there those

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
are all cooling units

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
um these are these are built

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,360
specifically for

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,000
scale compute in a single place

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,600
now if you're a company that's trying to

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,079
make your mark in the world

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
um starting out by building one of these

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,240
will take you years

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,759
and so eventually we started renting the

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
space inside of these

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,600
now we're just renting the instances on

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,600
top of it that compute

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,240
network and storage and so thankfully

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,639
companies like amazon and google and

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,240
microsoft and ibm and oracle

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,040
have all spent their hard built capital

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
over the years

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
into building out this massive amount of

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
infrastructure and i'm really thankful

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,279
for that

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
because what i get out of that is i get

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,399
all the hard parts of running

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
infrastructure

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,079
which is having you know things like

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
worrying about things like

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,560
redundant power supplies and having good

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
clean networking in and out

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,240
and making sure that that's redundant

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,120
and we don't have any downtime

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,040
so when we build these when we use these

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,360
we're taking advantage of that

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,519
but what these cloud companies have done

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,959
is they're like well we want you to use

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,680
ours

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,440
let's make this sticky so they started

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,639
offering these things as platform as a

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
service

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,399
and that means that they do a web server

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,160
or dev tools or middleware or databases

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,000
and these are all the services that they

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,880
sell you so

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and they're very popular like uh amazon

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,040
has some very popular databases

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,399
they sell a variety of middleware tools

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,560
and they even have tools that'll help

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,920
you just do like continuous integration

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,920
continuous build stuff

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
directly in amazon it makes it really

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
super simple

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
and i mean they're doing this on purpose

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,559
and you're

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
kind of going for it because what you're

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,640
doing is you're saying yeah i'm

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
i don't want to do anything else but

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
amazon and

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
they do they get that because what

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
eventually they're going to sell you and

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,520
what they're ultimately selling you

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is compute network and storage

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,679
these are just gadgets and sticky things

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
to put on top of it

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
so that you don't leave because they

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
have to

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,240
the only way that they grow is when they

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
put more

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
hours instance hours in and

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
more traffic over the network and more

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
bytes being stored into their storage

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,559
arrays

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
because that's what they get paid on all

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,360
the time

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,520
so if you look at the costs that are

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,240
associated with those services

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,919
they're just an additive cost and what's

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
interesting is that that's where we get

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
the most flexibility

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,400
is you'll notice that there are clear

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,520
loss leaders in a lot of clouds

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
loss leaders being hey we took uh this

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
service

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,440
and it's a lot cheaper than any other

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
service on any other cloud

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,799
well because they want you to move over

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
to the cloud

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,400
azure for instance with cosmos db they

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
really really want you in there and so

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
they will take

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,679
a lower price on cosmos db to get you in

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,039
there so that you'll start putting all

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
your other stuff in there

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,520
uh your web servers your devtools your

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,559
middleware and

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,600
data's super sticky and they know it

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,720
and why because we're building

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
everything that we build always needs

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
one thing

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,440
and that is a database whether it's

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
you're building web and mobile

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,160
applications you're building

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,120
microservices you're doing iot

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,960
work you name it it probably will have a

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,960
persistent data store somewhere

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
and if if the only exceptions are if

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
you're just storing raw data say in

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,080
something like an object storage like s3

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,120
but by and large every application has

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,960
data

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,600
and here's the other thing about data

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,240
data is really hard to work with once

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,840
it's firmly set up you can't just pick

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,799
it up and move it around

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,000
and yeah they know that because this is

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,240
what they do

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
they say hey let's build a walled garden

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
where your data lives

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,440
and you're stuck you are now in the

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
fortress

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,480
of open source to stop open source

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
and they do a really good job of making

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
sure that it looks great

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,280
but what they don't and what they don't

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,120
like to talk about

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,320
is how completely unportable it is um

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,000
example there are data there are very

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
similar services to open source

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
databases

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,080
running in clouds however they will not

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
replicate and they will not migrate to

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
other versions of that same open source

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
database outside of the cloud

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
and that's on purpose and you can't

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,919
blame them they're trying to get their

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,960
money

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,240
and this is how they grow but this

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,320
walled garden

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
of hey you're inside here and you're

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,919
doing things with data

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
um they could just like start counting

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,480
their money at that point because you're

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
in there for years

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,960
and if you ever get angry at them and

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,240
you don't like the cost

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
well then okay sorry go ahead and move

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
your data

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,960
if you think you can and you can't have

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,000
you ever noticed that

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,080
the most expensive thing on clouds

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,360
is egress costs data leaving the cloud

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,440
they don't want the data to leave the

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,440
cloud they wanted to be in the cloud

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,720
and they've proven it with their pricing

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
models all of them

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,919
so it's all is not lost our cause is not

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,039
over

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,679
we have a new hero

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
and this is the exciting part of this

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,919
talk

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,360
just hang on here we go kubernetes

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,120
now i know kubernetes is not new

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
it's been around for a while but it's

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,919
really picking up steam now

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
and why is this a hero for the open

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,880
source

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,679
thing like we're trying to make open

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,080
source survive and thrive

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,520
we do not want it to be the end of open

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,640
source

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,400
well at this point kubernetes

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,000
has started rocking the boat and

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
how is it rocking the boat well not just

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,520
the fact that it's really really popular

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,200
i mean it has completely swamped

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,840
everything at this point

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,720
but you'll notice that this is the one

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
thing

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,600
that allows you to do something that is

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
pretty hard to beat when it comes to

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,640
cloud

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
so let's just review what does

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,280
kubernetes do

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,400
well it takes a group of containers

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,720
applies a little magic and that magic is

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,559
what we also call orchestration

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
but it takes those containers rounds

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,480
them up compiles

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,480
puts you know puts them together and

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,240
deploys them into a virtual

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,880
data center so a long time ago

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,320
i would build physical data centers and

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,559
then i would use the data center

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,559
provided by the cloud and use

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,159
and i could deploy virtual machines like

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,559
instances or containers

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,760
great but now we're at the point where

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,120
we are deploying

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,320
entire virtual data centers

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,760
and that's pretty cool because

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,120
an entire virtual data center like that

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,240
now gives me a lot of options um

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,520
and those options are in how where i

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,320
want to run it

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
if everything is super portable then i

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,320
don't have to

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,640
go down the route of getting myself

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,400
locked in or worrying about like well if

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
what if i have to move

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,159
i'll give you an example and this

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,200
happened a few times

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
a few years ago target company here in

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
the us

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,600
which is a retailer their ceo

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
made the announcement that they will be

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,400
evacuating leaving

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,600
amazon web services and why

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,919
because amazon web services was a

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,200
competitor was amazon was a competitor

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,480
to target

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,679
and their ceo just hated giving money to

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
amazon

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,919
when they were a competitor so they had

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
a very public announcement how they were

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,919
going to move

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,799
everything over to google now

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,559
they are a huge user of cassandra and so

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,440
that part of the deal was not hard

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,320
because cassandra

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,400
couldn't run in any infrastructure but

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
it also required them at the time

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,039
because they weren't using this

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
particular technology

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,240
it required them to make some pretty

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,720
manual moves

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
but it was great for them to move out

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,720
and have that portability

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
imagine if it was just a deployment yaml

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,679
and you could just take a virtual

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
data center and lift and shift it over

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,320
to anything you want

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,520
and that's super scary for clouds really

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,600
scary

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,440
because you're turning a virtual data

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,679
center into a machine

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,880
you have inputs and then you have

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,039
outputs

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,039
and the underlying the underlying

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,559
compute network and storage

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,320
is really the only thing you're buying

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,960
from them

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
so you're turning them into a power plug

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
so

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,799
this is a this is an example of a north

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,159
american

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,799
power plug and there's a real beauty in

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
this

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
and the reason i i use this as an

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
example is

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,440
a long time ago if you were running any

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,480
kind of industrial application or

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,000
doing pi like in a city power was just

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
locally generated

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
electricity was locally generated there

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,200
was no standard

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,200
so could you imagine if you had to

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,960
buy say your blender or your

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,039
your washing machine or something like

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,520
that from your power company because

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,279
it was the only adapter that worked like

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,440
you couldn't just buy a washing machine

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,200
and have a standard plug

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,000
and that would be like today with cloud

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,960
well when we're talking about creating

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,240
virtual data centers on top of

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,760
compute network and storage it turns it

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,000
into a power plug

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,919
and we're getting commodity level we're

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
reducing the clouds down to what they

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
really

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,360
are and turning them into commodity

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
players

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,799
and when that kind of competition heats

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,840
up the only winners

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,840
are going to be us because

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,760
we're going to be able to take advantage

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,679
of that competitive pressure

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,440
and i here's the domino that i'm going

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,919
to see i would see fall

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,679
is when we see egress prices dropping

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,640
oracle's already done it

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,679
oracle has said no egress prices are the

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,360
same as ingress and so because you know

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,279
when you're way behind on the cloud you

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,919
got to do anything to get ahead

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,200
but this is i think this is a moment we

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
all have to take advantage of this

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
moment what are we going to do

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
with this moment because here's the

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,279
target

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,720
right we found their weak spot

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:52,240
is that they have this really cool

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,279
great infrastructure but we have

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,720
kubernetes

00:25:53,279 --> 00:26:00,960
that will make it abstract

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,120
and we have a plan so

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,520
lord helmets sitting in his tie fighter

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,039
a little nervous right now

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,279
so where are our heroes going to go from

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
here

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,159
well kubernetes we got a plan but here

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
are a few things about kubernetes that

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,760
we're gonna have to do

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
we're gonna have to work on together so

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,200
kubernetes is

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,799
really awesome it's stateless services

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
that's like the load balancers with

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,120
network

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,279
things like microservices which are

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,880
usually stateless middleware that just

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,080
passes messages around that sort of

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
thing

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,600
but the middleware processing like aca

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,039
that sort of thing

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,679
if you are have been using it for that

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,799
and

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,880
classic is is like just web serving on

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,720
top of kubernetes and doing scale web

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,640
serving with kubernetes

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,919
that's been rocking it's been really

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,880
good

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,679
but what hasn't been really as well as

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
well done

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,919
or hasn't been thought through as much

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,279
is stateful services

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,360
and stateful services are

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,039
uh can be somewhat hard for a lot of

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,159
reasons but these are where you do

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,720
things like file serving

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,080
your database and uh like more

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,919
persistent messaging like

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,919
pulsar or kafka and it's because there's

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,320
just a whole different class of service

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
stateless is great for distributed

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
computing because

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,520
if you lose one you just replace it

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,399
there's no setup and it's it's

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,279
fairly cheap to to move parts in and out

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,320
kubernetes as a technology is really

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,240
really good

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
at making sure that if something dies

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,120
out it'll come back

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,720
and so we have this band of rebels

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,600
working together now this

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,159
um there is i'm gonna do a sheamus plug

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
for this

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,480
community that i've been involved in

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,679
called doks data on kubernetes

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,679
um and this is a group of

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,600
people from various companies open

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
source projects etc

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,919
and i i really invite you to join us

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,360
here because this is um

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,000
where a lot of really cool stuff is

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,080
happening um dok community

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
is an independent organization right now

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,679
and uh

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,200
but this is a group of people that are

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,440
looking at data

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,520
as the thing to solve we have a plan

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
because the cloud the cloud powers we

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
love like these are things that we

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,399
really love about the cloud

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,480
is you get this on-demand scaling yay

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,760
because things happen and you don't know

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
how much you need until you need it

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
and then when you need it if you get it

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,799
you're happy

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,919
and that elastic pay for what you need

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,520
and elastic is so good because

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
you i mean back when i ran

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
infrastructure if you bought too much of

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,159
a server too many servers

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,080
and you didn't need them well you're

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
still paying for them and

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,399
even a lot of things that we use today

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,320
still don't scale down very well

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,600
but if it's elastic and pay for what you

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,559
need you can save

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,640
costs and then there's that up time

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,559
remember back the picture i had of the

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,960
the data center yeah they're really

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,120
really good at building data centers

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,600
and that near 100 uptime is going to be

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,880
like a fundamentally down to the like

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,720
electricity

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,320
and cooling and all the things that

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,919
happen network

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
getting that near 100 uptime in the

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,399
cloud is really important now it's not

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,080
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,440
but it's pretty close and they do a

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,880
really good job of keeping their stuff

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
online

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,159
but these are the cloud powers that we

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,080
love

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,000
but can we bring those into a system

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,760
because that challenge of stateful

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,720
services that storage network

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
and placement are these are the three

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,240
things that we're challenged by

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,919
so storage is like for instance um

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,080
yeah if you have any questions thank you

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,799
um ruth yeah if you have any questions

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,440
put them in the q

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,080
a um i haven't seen any yet but ruth let

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,679
me know in the chat if they're already

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,039
um so uh

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
these challenges that we're having to

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,000
deal with in cloud storage

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,399
are are in cloud or i'm sorry in

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,440
kubernetes to get our cloud

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,960
uh magical powers storage

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,279
storage is a big one probably the

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
biggest because there's just a class of

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,000
storage that has to be there for

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,600
stateful services

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,480
we need to think about how well it

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,919
performs that type of capacity elastic

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,559
capacity especially

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,520
and then really backup doing snapshots

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,520
that sort of thing

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,919
um the kind of storage that was in place

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,640
for stale services was very ephemeral

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,000
just came and went and now we can't

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,200
really do that with data so that's

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
that's a big

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,279
subject inside the data on kubernetes

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,760
world and then also network

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,279
and there's just some different classes

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
of networking

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,120
actually the one that i'm i'm most

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,679
interested in is transit

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,960
moving data from one from one kubernetes

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
cluster to another say

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
maybe it's across country across the

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,919
world um this

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
is a thing that's being solved right now

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,320
it's a big challenge in staples services

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,519
because a lot of that relies on

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
replication

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,760
and then finally placement i'll use an

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,360
example of apache cassandra

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,000
cassandra has its own idea of where

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,600
data and nodes are arranged inside of a

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,559
physical infrastructure

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,919
kubernetes has its own ideas and so

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,120
whenever you think about like when

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,880
you're putting together a

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,159
large group of servers that act as a

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,120
cluster

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,679
distribution like where those things are

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,519
and

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,279
how they stay online for instance if you

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,559
kubernetes with a pod you know you have

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,000
a bunch of different servers that are

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,960
running in containers that are running

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,679
on a particular

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,279
server if that one went down then you

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,679
take your entire cluster with it

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,039
well that's a bad idea let's not do that

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,919
so there's there's things to think about

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,159
in that regard

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
with stateless services it's pretty easy

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
because you can just throw them anywhere

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,760
and everywhere and they're fine and then

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
finally the coordination

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,080
if a no goes offline in a distributed

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,760
system a database like cassandra

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,279
you have to think carefully about how

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,840
you bring it back online you don't just

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,679
replace it immediately there's some

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,799
consideration about like where the data

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,720
is and again where

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,360
placement is so these are things that

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,320
we're working on right now

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,640
so we have a new champion now and this

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
is

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
part of what i wanted to talk about

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,480
today and

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
i in the subtext i say it's actually an

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,080
old one with a great makeover

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,519
i've been talking about apache cassandra

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
here and there

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,360
well the project that i'm also working

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,799
on is kate sandra and

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,000
case sandra is a really it's a project

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,480
to collect sre knowledge

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,480
around running a scale database like

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,559
cassandra in kubernetes

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,600
because kubernetes started before

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,440
kubernetes uh

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,000
cassandra started before kubernetes was

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,880
a thing and it was doing distributed way

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
back in the day and now that kubernetes

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
has become

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,519
the dominant way of uh destroying

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,519
destroying

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
distributing destroying your

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,279
infrastructure it could do that too if

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,960
you're not careful

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
your dominant way of distributing the

00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,919
large-scale infrastructure especially

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,480
around applications

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
um cassandra's has always been looked at

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,200
in that but

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,720
now there's just a large group of

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
infrastructure people that are like well

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
i want to run cassandra kubernetes i

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
don't want to have two different control

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,559
planes

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,919
i want to have one so keith sanders a

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,760
project to do that

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,279
and it's pretty interesting project

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,960
because what it is

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,640
and it's changing the way we're some of

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
the dynamics in open source

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,559
cassandra is an apache project and open

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,240
source project but we're adding in

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,519
things like stargate which is another

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,960
open source project

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,159
which provides a data gateway on topic

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,480
sandra and other databases soon it uses

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,440
all the kubernetes ingress for external

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,440
access

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
it uses other projects called reaper and

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,919
medusa which are part of the apache

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,159
ecosystem

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,840
for doing repairs and backups on the

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,559
database like your daily maintenance

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,919
tasks

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,919
and then it takes advantage of all the

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,960
observability tools like prometheus and

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
grafana to make sure that your

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,399
databases are monitored and things are

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,760
going right you know you can see it

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,640
and this package of things

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,200
so what we're doing now with kate sandra

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,399
is we're

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,720
building a service tier for data

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,320
with everything that's needed in

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,599
kubernetes

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:18,159
and it's it's a project of projects

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,839
and what i like to describe

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,760
this is that because we're using things

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,599
like helm charts

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
this is a lot more than just a bunch of

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,159
bits

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,359
this is where sres that are deploying

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,960
scale data services on kubernetes

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,200
can compile all that information and

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,280
knowledge and share it with each other

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,960
because that is one of the my favorite

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,240
features of open source

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,679
is when we're sharing information um

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,359
you know putting all these things out in

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,480
the public and making

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,280
everyone better and there are some

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,879
really interesting large cassandra

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
installations out there that are moving

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,119
into kubernetes

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,560
and if you're just starting with data on

00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,440
kubernetes

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,760
you're going to be able to take

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,359
advantage of this years of experience

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,160
running scale data services on

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,160
kubernetes and that's what it's about

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,839
and what we want to build here is and

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,680
this is just one project doing it but

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,400
it's also real i think it's it's a great

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,599
example

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
of how we can take back a lot of what we

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,240
need

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,640
in the clouds which is it creates this

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,520
this package of things that normally we

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:30,960
would rent from a cloud

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:33,280
now i have to tell you that keith sandra

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,079
you know was started at data stacks but

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,160
it's really an

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,200
open source version of our own cloud

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,320
database called

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,440
astra astra is a cassandra as a service

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,320
that we run

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,000
but we run all that on kubernetes and we

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,359
run it on any cloud

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,200
so here we are um keith sandra

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,119
is that open source version of that

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
because we took we have our own sre

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,599
knowledge

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,880
and we're working with other companies

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,079
to get kate

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,720
sandra in a place where anyone can

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,079
just do the most scale database ever you

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,240
could run a netflix

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,240
scale database on a

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,880
what kind of budget would that be hulu

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,000
no hulu uses cassandra too

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,920
you could do your own thing so here's

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
like the really cool thing about what we

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,599
can build now

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
is we can go from say a laptop using

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,200
minikube

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,720
which is a lot of fun i love mini coop

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,720
minikub lets you run a

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,040
kubernetes cluster on your laptop be

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,000
careful you can burn up your laptop

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,480
but you can take a deployment yaml which

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
has

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,640
all of the bits everything you need to

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,560
run a scale application you know the

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,680
ingress the load balancing

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,480
all the different containers for the

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,760
microservices your service mesh to glue

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,400
it all together

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,000
the storage profiles the database

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,119
services that you're gonna run

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,760
take all that one yaml deploy it or

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,680
i'm sorry committed into get so that now

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,359
this is just everyone's configuration

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,359
for our application

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,680
so a developer could go to the their

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,079
laptop and deploy it using minikube

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,760
and they get a virtual data center right

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,960
there in their laptop

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,359
the 18 but what if i wanted to take that

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
hey i'm i i'm still using a lot of

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,320
on-prem data

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,839
well like vmware tanzu which is a

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,320
kubernetes for

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,680
on-prem you can take that same yaml file

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,200
and deploy it right into

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,839
a virtual data center what if you're in

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,440
a cloud

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,079
then you want to do this well same story

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,520
azure kubernetes service aks just take

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,320
that yaml file

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,720
deploy that virtual data center in azure

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,040
use

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,320
their big three their compute network

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,400
and storage

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,440
and you're starting to commoditize the

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,320
clouds

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,920
and if azure doesn't really let's say

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
that their compute network and storage

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,520
prices are a little out of bounds and

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,680
you're like i think it's time to get out

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,160
of here and go to a cheaper alternative

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,079
sure you could do that you can run it in

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,200
two clouds if you wanted to

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,160
and this is kind of a thing now um

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,119
i it's where we've gotten over time

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,440
because

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,560
you know through acquisitions or you

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,560
just want to try a different cloud and

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,119
before you know it you're in two clouds

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,560
great i mean being more than one cloud

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,079
is pretty common now

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,079
and it's not something you did on

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,960
purpose probably but you're there it's

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
going to happen

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,400
but what i think is really cool is that

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,839
now you are

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,119
using the compute network and storage

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,680
for all these clouds

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,040
if you're using kubernetes and when

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,720
you're using

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,200
google kubernetes engine or amazon eks

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,560
to deploy your infrastructure you're

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,320
getting the best price that they can

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,240
give you on those things

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,160
and when they don't give you the best

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,320
price then you can just move your

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,960
virtual data center to something else

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,920
and kubernetes is gonna create this

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,200
situation

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
we just have to get it right with the

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,040
data and i think we're gonna be okay

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,400
but this is a really cool future that

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,680
we're building right now

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,839
and um it will create a lot of

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,720
competitive pressure in the clouds

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,160
and who knows what'll happen then so

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,359
these are the two futures that i think

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,720
we have

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:14,240
um we have this future where

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,520
we could be living in that walled garden

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,280
and i it always makes me cringe when i

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,440
you know i see some conference some

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
cloud vendor conference you've probably

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,839
been to one

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,280
and you see some cto or cio from company

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,640
x come up and say we're all in on cloudx

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,640
and it's just like oh are you yeah we're

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,599
all in we love the walled garden it's

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,359
great

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,359
um that's a future that could happen

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,280
or we could start thinking in terms of

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,520
virtual data centers

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
and what we get from that is we would

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,760
start thinking in turn

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,000
like clouds being the end-all be-all in

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,240
the walled garden that it is

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and we start thinking like what it is

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,680
it's just just a receptacle

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
a plug for the things that we actually

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,680
need at commodity

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,280
and we start working with it at

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,760
commodity pricing

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,119
and we build what we need to what we

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,160
want wherever we need it

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,119
so just kind of summarize here the

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,880
things that are going to give you

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,319
success as you move forward with this

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
and if you want to do this

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,920
here's your steps and or things to

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,760
remember

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,599
and i think you probably picked this up

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,000
along the way but

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,760
first and foremost always design and

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,640
optimize for portability

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,400
so thinking ahead and using something

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,960
like kubernetes well use kubernetes

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,720
first of all

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,440
because that is built to do what this

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,000
does and designing and optimizing around

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
portability

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,359
means that i would like to be able to

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,280
deploy everything i need inside of this

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,160
kubernetes

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,920
yaml file and if there's something

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,200
outside let's say you're connecting to

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
services make sure that those are

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
somewhat portable too

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,839
they use the common standard or

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,480
something like that um

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,960
like for instance pulsar um you know

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,040
that

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
that's a great standard that you can get

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,520
in any cloud

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
and so if you want to connect to a

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
service outside that uses pulsar

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,240
great but just remember that that's got

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,359
to be portable

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,440
and then because of that for portability

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,200
the flip side of that portability is

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,599
don't do the unportable things which is

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,599
using cloud-specific services

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,200
specifically data services because data

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,440
services are

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,119
really sneaky ways to lock you in and

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,720
you will get locked in and you might

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,319
even be happy for a while but all of a

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,200
sudden you'll notice that your bill

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,760
is dominated by that particular service

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
um

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
and then finally or you know the open

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,960
source contributing companies

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
look at who's contributing to open

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,040
source and

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
and this is just giving your support in

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,480
that way but just

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,079
support those companies in some way it

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,760
doesn't even have to be monetary

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,280
maybe it's just speaking at a conference

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,000
or something like that but

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,440
it's like we want to keep the ecosystem

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,560
of open source going

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,160
and at least if anything

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,839
please contribute to open source

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,760
projects that you use

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,160
and this is what makes it better and

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,240
keeps the future moving forward

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,560
and then finally and this is the big

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,480
thing the big part of this talk

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
this is our plan this is where how we're

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,640
going to take out the death star

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,240
is deploy the data centers not servers

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,240
so think of everything as a virtual data

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
center that you're going to deploy and

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,680
that

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,079
i think that is what we really want is

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,920
um when we think of things as we're

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,160
deploying an entire data center we think

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,079
of

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,839
all the things are portable we're not

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,119
thinking about locking ourselves into a

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,000
certain cloud or

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,680
certain paradigm we're creating

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,560
portability

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,680
and it's not a huge trade-off there are

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,400
ways to make things

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,000
just as awesome and probably better than

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,920
what a cloud will offer you

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,160
you just need to look at it and look for

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,200
it or ask questions or

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,480
join so what you could do right now if

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,040
you want to learn more about how to do

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,680
this you can go to keith sanders iio

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,119
and we have some getting started uh we

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,720
do these free workshops on

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,839
on youtube all the time basic stuff like

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,640
how to do

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,960
apache cassandra stuff we're doing

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,839
pulsar now as well

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,440
we have things on how to run kubernetes

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,599
build containers

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,200
our workshops are really fun and they're

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,640
always really well attended we're doing

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,200
workshops right now that have thousands

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,280
of people in them and they're meant to

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,800
be practical knowledge for people that

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,960
are building things

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,480
for developers and they're for operators

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,319
so go check it out

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,319
youtube is easy um and then finally

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,839
so this is what i wanted you to take

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,599
away and

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,920
this is really important to me right now

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,319
this is really part of my mission

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,480
is you know kubernetes lets us create

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,319
virtual data centers for what we need

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,000
i think we've established that we have

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,480
some work to do to make it right

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,319
and imperfect but this is it and that

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,079
last frontier is data

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,240
which the clouds are trying to use to

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,599
lock you in

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,119
we're going to take that back so i hope

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,599
you can join us doing that

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,640
we would love you in our community and

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,119
helping us

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,560
create a really cool future for the next

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,480
generation of developers that are going

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,400
to come along

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,119
thank you very much and i will

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
leave it for any questions we have thank

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,160
you so much

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,359
patrick for that session

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,160
um i do not see um

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,440
any questions at this point please if

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,440
you have any questions

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,079
and if you also want to use the raised

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:37,119
hand feature that's also fine

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:41,040
so if you have any questions

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:43,839
let's stop my share get out of here

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,839

have another set yeah exactly

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,800
exactly thank you so much

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,319
thank you ruth for being such a great

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,359
host oh

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:05,040
i see a question so there's a question

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,599
that's like can't you yeah

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,760
uh there's yeah so case standard

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,960

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,599
kubernetes

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,800
kafka thing there are a lot of projects

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,319
out there that are doing this

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,720
like taking a existing project

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,720
and then creating a project to build a

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,119
kubernetes version of it

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,480
