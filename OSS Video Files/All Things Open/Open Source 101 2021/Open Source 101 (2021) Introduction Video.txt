hey this is todd lewis with all things

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
open and open source 101.

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
i want to take just a minute to thank

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,359
you profusely for joining us today

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,359
we know a lot's still going on in the

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
world the covet situation is getting

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,359
better it's been with us for about a

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
year now

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
but we are at least heading in the right

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,080
direction even with that we're still

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,840
doing a virtual event

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
and we know that you have personal

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,640
considerations and business

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,360
considerations that you've never had

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
before

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
so again that's not lost on us the fact

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,879
that you've taken the time to join us

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,719
today we greatly appreciate it

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
we don't take it for granted and from

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,280
the all things open in the open source

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,039
101 team

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
thank you so much for joining us thank

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
you thank you

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
okay so a little bit about the history

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,160
of open source 101 for those that may

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
not have joined us before

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
we started this series about five years

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
ago this will be our eighth

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
event the eighth 101 that we've done

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,559
here's what we found over

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
more than a decade of doing this even

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,680
though a lot of people think

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
everyone knows and understands

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
foundational or fundamental open source

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
principles processes and technologies

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
and community etc

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,560
we have found that that is not the case

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
a lot of people just entering

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
uh this sector or getting into the open

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
source space or even technology in

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,640
general

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,920
they don't know they don't have that

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,520
basic understanding

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
so we've realized this again we've based

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,000
this on a decade of comments and

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
conversations

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
that we've had around the world so

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,600
that's really why we started this series

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
is to really provide the education so

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
that someone that attends the event can

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
come in the morning

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
not really be that familiar with

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
foundational principles

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
and leave at the end of the day with a

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,640
pretty firm understanding they won't be

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,720
experts of course we don't

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
expect that that's not the expectation

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
but having a pretty firm grasp or at

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
least a much

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
better grasp of foundational principles

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,320
is very important to us we think that

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,320
delivers a lot of value

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,159
and the attendees that leave and consume

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,079
the content over the course of a day

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,840
are going to be much better positioned

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,840
afterwards than they were beforehand

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
all right a little bit about what you'll

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,160
experience on the virtual platform today

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
from a content perspective we'll start

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,920
out at 10 a.m with our keynote block

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
that'll last until 11 30. so an hour and

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
a half

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
of keynotes within that block will be

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
four world-class keynote talks on

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,080
high-level topics from unbelievably good

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
speakers

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
we think you'll really enjoy it we'll

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,920
then move to our breakout sessions our

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
breakout sessions will start at 11 45

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
a.m

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,920
and then we'll last and go through the

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,959
remainder of the day till about 4 30 or

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
4 45

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
each of those sessions will be 45

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
minutes three of them will be extended

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
90 minute sessions to allow a little

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
deeper dive so the majority 45 minutes

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
and then three of them will be 90

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,599
minutes and you'll know which ones they

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,480
are based on your schedule so please

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,480
take a look at that

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
from a sponsor perspective we will have

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
a virtual exhibit hall you can navigate

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
around we strongly encourage you to go

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
over and visit our sponsors

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
they are making this possible they're

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
really making everything that you're

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
experiencing today possible so we really

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
appreciate their support

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
many of them are offering jobs many of

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
them are there they're actually

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
live in their virtual booth to talk to

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
you so we really encourage you to stop

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
by and say hello and thank them

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,400
for helping us make this conference

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
available to you today

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
final thing is the networking lounge we

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
know that you're here to get content so

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
the sessions are at top level priority

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
for you

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
and then but second secondarily is

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
networking it's actually meeting new

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
people within the space so we do have a

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
networking lounge you can take advantage

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
of

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
we strongly encourage you to do that as

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
well so again content

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,959
keynotes and breakout sessions we do

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
have the exhibit hall

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
we encourage you to talk to our sponsors

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
and our and our partners

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
and then finally networking we encourage

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,799
you to visit the networking lounge

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
and get to know each other meet new

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,159
people and form relationships that can

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
benefit you moving forward

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
here's the final thing i'll say and it's

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
really in regard to the event being

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
virtual obviously

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
again we're the world is still grappling

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,239
with coveted related issues so

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,760
we this event is 100 virtual we didn't

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
want to put anyone at risk

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
uh we would honestly prefer to do an

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,959
in-person event

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
most of our events have been in person

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
up to this point obviously we had to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
adapt

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
uh to the covet situation that has

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,639
impacted us all so

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
even though it's a virtual event we've

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
really taken uh

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
you know we've done everything possible

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
to adapt the virtual platform to

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,759
replicate or mimic the in-person

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
experience as closely as possible so

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
we think as you get into the virtual

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,199
environment and begin to navigate around

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
it won't be the same thing

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
obviously but we have worked very hard

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
to make it

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
resemble as closely as possible the

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,919
in-person experience so

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
please you know exercise some patience

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199
be a little patient with us

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,720
everything won't be perfect again as

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
you're in the in the environment

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
navigating around

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
uh but do understand that the team the

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
all things open and open source 101 team

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,080
we really would much prefer to do

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,759
in-person events we hope to be back to

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,759
in person here very soon we hope the

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
situation continues to improve

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
but for now we're working very hard to

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,479
make the best of the virtual environment

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
and the

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
really the best of a challenging

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,680
situation so thank you again for joining

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,039
we truly appreciate it

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
and we'll see you within the virtual

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,840
platform

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,720
