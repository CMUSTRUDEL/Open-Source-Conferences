thank you so much so hey everyone my

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,559
name is maria lamardo

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
i am a digital design accessibility

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
manager at cvs health

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
and i'm also a vue.js community partner

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
as well as a board certified assistant

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,080
behavior

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,680
analyst analyst and i'm also a

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,480
accessibility advocate which i

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
absolutely love

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,680
so today i'm here to talk to you about

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,199
web accessibility and what is web

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
accessibility well

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
the web is fundamentally designed to

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
work for all

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,440
people whatever their hardware software

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
language location or ability

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
and we are provided some guidelines that

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
allows us to do that

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
but first let's talk a little bit about

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,719
population

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
well it's estimated that around 1

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
billion people

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
live with disabilities worldwide and

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
that's an estimated 15 percent of the

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,280
world's population

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,239
making them the world's largest minority

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
this also makes up for over 6 trillion

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,920
dollars in spending power

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,640
for people with disabilities at the

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
global market

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
then there's also different types of

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
disabilities and here are a couple of

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
them

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
we can have motor disabilities where

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
people might need to use

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
um technologies like voice recognition

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,119
software or eye tracking or adaptive

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
keyboard

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,280
or even head ones we also have a visual

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,439
impairment that um some people might

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
need screen magnification or screen

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,479
readers or braille

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
we also have cognitive disabilities um

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,799
where we might

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
want to be careful with our use of

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,200
language and any cognitive load for

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,439
our users and there are also auditory

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
impairments in which case we want to

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
make sure that we're providing any

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,720
captioning or scripts

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,759
or transcripts or sign language in any

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,079
video or media that we have

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
and there's a lot more um to discuss

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
here but this is like a quick

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,680
overview and well how do you get started

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
if you want to have an accessible

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
application

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
well you can start small there are a lot

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
of changes that you can make to a lot of

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
projects to create like to improve

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
accessibility and

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
make easy wins um there's also simple

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,280
ways to improve the design of your

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,560
content and making sure that you're cur

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
carefully making layouts and content

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
that is accessible

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
uh you can also make sure that you're

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,239
using good semantics

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,959
as you can include improve your content

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
structure which is used by accessibility

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
and assistive tech it's used by

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
assistive technology to navigate your

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,239
application

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
and of course making sure that you're

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
testing for keyboard access

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,800
as all interactive elements must be

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
operable by a keyboard

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
and so here we start talking about the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
form elements

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,160
and how we can make our forms accessible

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
so the html form element is used to

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
create

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
kind of a form for user input and this

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,280
can hold many different types of

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,879
elements that are listed here

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
and we're going to be talking about a

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
couple of these different types of

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
elements

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,040
that exist inside of a standard form so

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,920
let's quickly move on to some examples

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,680
so here i have an example of a very

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,360
simple form structure

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
so all we have here is a input field

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,159
that

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
has a label of first name and a second

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,879
input field that has

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,120
a label of last name so because this is

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
a semantic form element

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
we can see that there's a form and then

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,040
there's also a

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,720
button um and if i start typing and

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
filling out my information

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
so i'm typing my first name maria and

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
last name lamardo

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
and because it's a i'm in the second

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
input field currently

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
and because this is a form element i can

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
submit it

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,680
by hitting the enter key from any of the

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
key inputs so you can see i'm hitting

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
the enter key

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,239
and that did submit my form

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,519
one thing that i do want to call out is

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,120
if we want to open this in codepen

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,280
and i'll just change it like this um

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
let's change instead of having a form

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
element what would happen if we changed

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,760
it to a div

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
so we are expecting to be able to submit

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,919
this form

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
from any input and pressing enter so

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,759
right now because

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
i've changed the form into a div that

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
functionality no longer exists now i

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
can't

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,080
be in an input field and hit enter to

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
submit in fact if i

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,440
even hit the submit button nothing

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
happens

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
so let's go back and change it to a form

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
element

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,160
we can see that even as i with that

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,440
small change as i try to submit

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,280
the form does um submit um

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
even even without any input as long as

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,040
we have that form element

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,479
so you could see by just having the

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
correct semantics

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,880
you can um have certain expectations

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,880
for the user functionality

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,560
now another thing that this helps with

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
is also

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
you're also able to navigate all of the

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
form controls

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,639
with your screen reader so right now i'm

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
going to turn on my screen reader and i

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
am using a mac so i'm using voiceover

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,600
which is built into my mac

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,600
um so i can turn this on with command f5

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
voiceover on chrome form structure

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
google chrome in cop

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,199
so now uh i can also quickly tab through

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,160
all of the form

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
form first name last name edit submit

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
button

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
um but also um i can also navigate

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,800
through all of my

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,000
um form contr like controls

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
uh with command option uh control and

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
the letter j

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
so if i do that form structure form

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
selected

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,000
form unset last name at submit button

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
you are currently on voiceover off so

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
you could see that you even allow

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
certain um keyboard shortcuts with using

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,600
the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,600
proper html form element

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,400
okay so going back to our um

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
to our slides uh so not only do we have

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
to make sure that we're using the

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
correct

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,199
um semantic elements but we also want to

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
make sure that our content structure

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,560
um is also accessible so this includes

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
like

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
keeping thing keeping labels and input

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
fields that are corresponding close

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
together

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,919
um to create that connection so if we

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,479
look at another example

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
um so let's look at this one here we can

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,240
see that we have

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
a phone number label and then we have

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
this kind of

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,120
icon that is kind of intrusive in the

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,960
middle of the way it's kind of big

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,039
and then we have some text underneath

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,520
that and then

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,360
we find our input field so you can see

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
that there's content between the input

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,759
field and the label

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,520
and though i might be able to tell what

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,160
information is expected in this input

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,199
field

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,400
let's pretend that i was a um a user

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,479
that needed to be

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,639
um hold on zoomed in at like

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,599
let's say 200 and in fact i'm going to

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
just open this

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
so that it's in view uh and i'm gonna go

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
to

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,759
even even 400 right so you could see

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,240
that i see the label up here but now i'm

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,440
kind of scrolling down for that input

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
field and now

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,639
i'm now that i'm in the input field i

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
have no idea where that corresponding

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
label is so

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
it's kind of making that that connection

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,639
really hard for me to figure out

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
um so really it's best to keep all of

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
our

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
form elements together with that being

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
said we also want to be careful not to

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
use css

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,599
to move things visually in the page

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,599
without changing the dom order

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,160
for example in this example here

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,160
i've created the same content um so you

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
can see that um we have

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,160
uh the phone number label with the phone

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
number input field and right now the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,599
the label is visually right on top of

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
the input field

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,599
and then we see that icon and a bunch of

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
text kind of on the right but it is out

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
of the way so

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
hey this kind of looks good to me but

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
let me go ahead and turn on my screen

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,639
reader

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,199
voiceover on chrome moving content with

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,520
css google chrome incognito window

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
accessible form phone number content

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
selected okay so now

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,879
um i'm going to be using uh voice over

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
quick nav

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
uh which i can turn on by hitting both

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,960
arrow keys together so right arrow key

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
and left arrow keys quick knob off

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
quick nav on you can see how i can

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,759
toggle that on and off so if i have it

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
on i'm able to navigate through all of

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,960
the elements

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
in the dom order um with the arrow keys

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
so i'm just gonna

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,200
hit right phone image phone number

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,279
heading level one

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,719
moving content with c phone number we

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,360
have the phone number label

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,560
phone image you are current at vero eos

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
edit use them sadisto

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,080
but now the content kind of jump from

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
that phone number label

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
all the way to the right to the icon now

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
it's reading that like text

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
phone number edit variable now it's in

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
the input field

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,519
so even though they're visually together

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,600
semantically and in the dom

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
these elements are actually far apart

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
voice over off

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,640
and css was used to kind of float

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
the content to the right although it's

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,480
visually

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
close and you can tell that um

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
correlation

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,720
we want to make sure that um we're also

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
uh

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
structuring the content so that it

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
follows that logical order

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,680
so instead of doing this with css we

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,839
might want to change the order of this

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
icon and this paragraph in the dom so

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
that the label and the input field are

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,760
truly

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,760
next to each other

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,320
let me see if there are any questions so

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
far okay perfect

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
another thing that i want to call out is

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
that we want to make sure that color is

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
not

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,240
the only representation or the only

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
means to conveying any information for

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
the user

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,320
and that the color that we do use in our

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
application meets the color contrast

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
so let's take a look at some of those

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
examples

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
so here when we're providing

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,120
instructions um let's take a look at

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,200
this example we have again a first name

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
field and a last name field and then we

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
have

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
a text that says red fields are required

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,560
and then we see that the first name

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,959
field has an outline border of red

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
so the only way that users are able to

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,120
tell which fields are required

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
is if you were able to see the outline

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,959
colored red

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
so right now we're using color alone to

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,200
indicate required fields which is

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,399
not easy to do because not all users

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
will be able to see that red coloring

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,240
and to give you a little bit of an

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,440
example of that um here's a little

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,880
chart color wheel that i have so on the

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
left we have a color wheel so you could

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
see all the colors we have orange pink

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
yellow you know green

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,440
blue and then on the right we have four

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
different um

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
color wheels uh and they're actually the

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,640
same as on the right

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,040
but on top you could see uh color uh

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
different types of color blindness um so

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
the first one you could see that the

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,519
colors are a little bit skewed you could

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,959
even see the gray scale

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,959
you can't even see any of the colors

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
there so you can see that if you are

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
trying to indicate

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
meaning through the use of colors it

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
might not

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,519
mean the same thing to a lot of users

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
right because color isn't perceived the

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,279
same for everybody

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,640
so just keep that in mind and if you are

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
showing something in color make sure

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,240
that there's like a text

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,079
alternative to that so one good way to

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
call out required fields would be to say

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,640
something like fields with asterisks are

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
required and then providing that little

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,640
asterisk at the end

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,640
um that would be um a good idea

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,200
okay another thing that i wanted to call

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,640
out on this one and i'll actually open

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,920
codepen here

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,880
um is the use of a reque the attribute

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
required

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
um so let me actually zoom in here um so

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
here we have

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,760
the first name and last name um which we

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
have called out as both required fields

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,920
so if we're looking at our code we can

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
see that we have an input field for the

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
first name

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,200
and that input field has both html5

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,399
required element

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920
and the aria required attribute set to

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,360
true

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
so let's take a look at this

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,399
functionality if i have

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,320
the required fields and i'm using chrome

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,839
so if i try to submit this form with

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,519
empty fields

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,040
you could see that chrome kind of has

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,079
their own built-in

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,279
um validation that tells me hey

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,720
fill out fill out this field uh and it

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
knows that it's required it doesn't

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
allow me to submit my form

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,839
until i fill that out so if i fill out

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
my first name and i from here i'm gonna

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,880
hit enter

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,600
and now it tells me okay my last name is

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,839
also required please fill out this form

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,560
let's now take a look at what happens if

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,000
i just took out the html5

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,519
attribute for required from the last

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
name so the first name still has it so

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
if i try to submit not having anything

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
on the first name it does give me that

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,680
validation

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but since i've removed it from the last

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,480
name it does allow me to submit

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
um so just to kind of show you that the

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,160
html5 attribute

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,760
does um block or does add additional

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
functionality depending on the browser

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,480
that you're using and it does

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,399
block the forms to be submitted um

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
if i was to remove this and inspect

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,560
i do want to i do want you to see what's

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,920
happening kind of

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,279
on the back end of this okay

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,279
let's just refresh really quick

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,760
okay so here it is um if i

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,199
inspect the the input field and look at

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,880
the accessibility tab i am looking for

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,560
um invalid user entry which is set

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,240
to true because this form has the html5

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,399
attribute of required but if i

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,040
were to remove that you can see that

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,079
that invalid uh user entry defaults to

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,399
false

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,000
uh whereas the other input field that i

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,839
have here so like the first name

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,639
one it is the

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
user entry is set to true um so it is

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,480
invalid

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,680
by default when you um have that

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,680
required attribute

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,519
where if you don't include that then it

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
is set to false and it does allow you to

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
submit that form

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
so just to kind of keep in mind um

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
different functionality that you have

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
based on those attributes

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,399
and how browsers can block um that

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
submission

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
another thing about colors um is that we

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,639
want to make sure that we're meeting

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
or you know we want to strive to meet uh

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
2.1

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
uh triple a if possible but certainly

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
double a

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
so for normal text um you want to make

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
sure that

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,839
to meet a double a you want to make sure

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,240
that your color contrast is 4.5 to 1

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,079
whereas for large text which is defined

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,279
as 14 points or

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,160
about 18 pixels or

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,680
18 points or larger so that has to be a

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
three to one ratio

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
same for user interface and i've

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
actually added a

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
nice color contrast link here which

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,760
looks something like this

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
so what this allows you to do is you can

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
input

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,959
different colors for the foreground

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,440
color so this is kind of like the text

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,320
the color of your text so you could see

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,399
here that as i'm

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,079
i update the color of the text the

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,440
examples on the right here

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,000
um update and so do the tests for uh

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,959
which wechat standard they're passing so

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,320
this color

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,959
combination is passing at a double a

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,720
whereas it's failing at aaa and you can

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,639
also change the color of the background

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,519
and you can see that both

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
background color and uh text color can

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,079
be

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,079
changed and they also show you um the

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,920
color of the user interface or any

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,600
graphical objects that you might want to

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,839
use in your application you also want to

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,320
make sure that those meet the color

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,839
contrast

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,279
okay um going on to labels and

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,560
instructions

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,440
um let's take a look at how we want to

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,279
um or what is available out there for us

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,320
to be able to label things

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,120
we can add additional naming with aria

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
label

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
which provides some essential

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,959
information about an object and this is

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
typically used

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,079
when there is no visual indicator of

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
anything so for example if we have an

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,639
icon we might want to add

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,480
an aria label to this like if we have an

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,360
um a modal and then there's like that

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
little x

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
um button you know that button that has

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,720
that little x to close the model

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,360
we might add an aria label to say close

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
and then aria labeled by is kind of

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
similar

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
but it establishes relationship between

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,880
an object that already exists

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,560
on the page by its id

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
so let's take a look at an example of

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,360
exactly what that means

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,440
um so we have many labels um let's take

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,759
a look at these examples i have two

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,680
search fields here i have a primary

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,560
search input field and a secondary

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
um search input field um so here we have

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,240
a label

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,720
um that i have visually hidden then i

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,360
have an

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
input field for search and that is

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,600
followed by

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,959
a search submit button and then the form

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,160
element has a role of search um

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,000
and let me just quickly talk well let's

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,360
let's go over this and then i'll quickly

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
talk about um

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
roll and the landmark overall but for

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
now we can see that this

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,679
input field although it has a label it

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
also has an

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,440
aria label by so let's go ahead and

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,720
inspect

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,720
and see what this is like so in fact let

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
me open it in codepen so we can inspect

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,880
it a little bit easier

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,880
and let's go into full page view

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,799
so if i inspect the first element um

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,039
the first input i mean um and i'm

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,039
actually going to

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,320
zoom in over here and i'm going to go to

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,960
the accessibility tab

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,000
inside of chrome um so looking at this

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
input field we can

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
see a couple of um computer properties

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
for that element

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
so you could see that it has an

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,640
accessible name of search

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
primary site-wide and how that's

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
happening is

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
well we could see that there's no title

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,840
no aria placeholder

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,720
um no no no label specified from the

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,640
label yet

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,679
even though we have aria labeled by

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,039
and this is using the search id

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,679
so the search id is the con the

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,799
the label itself right so this is the

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,919
search

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,280
uh label and then the search heading so

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
we're combining both

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,600
the label i'm heading to create this

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,480
naming so for aria labeled by

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,760
you compare multiple ids to create a

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
longer

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,000
naming or you can use one to pair with

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,720
an existing content

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,960
so this is where search is coming from

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
the label and the primary side white is

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,000
coming from that heading

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,000
so we grab the label and the heading

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
so another thing i want to point out

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
that would be an instance of where you

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,440
want to use

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,520
aria labeled by by arya label um

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
there's a case for using it something

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,919
like this

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
um and let me explain why that might be

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,280
um

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
now there's different html elements um

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,320
that

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,400
provide a way for assistive technology

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,840
to kind of jump quickly through the page

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,200
and this is by the creation of landmarks

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,160
and there's different landmarks that can

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,520
be created so if you're using an html5

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
header element

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
this would be equivalent to using a roll

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,880
of banner

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,960
which is meant to hold any name

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
a website maybe a title of the page and

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
a logo

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,919
and you can see that there's multiple

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,400
different ones like navigation

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,640
or a role of main to hold the main

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
content of the site and if you look all

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,559
the way down here

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,320
you see um that there's one aria role

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,960
that is role of search

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
however there's no html5 element for

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
that

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,400
so let's go take a look at how i've

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,159
implemented this role of search

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,120
so as we saw here there is a role of

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,679
search in that

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,559
form element and if i actually

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,600
turn on my screen reader for this

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,799
voiceover on chrome

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,840
our labels i can access all of the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
landmarks

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
by landmarks menu well by hitting

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,720
control

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,400
option um i'm the letter u and

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,200
actually i can't show you but

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
commission space with two items chrome

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,919
are labeled

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,440
into this screen um but what i'm seeing

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,360
is like this landmark

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,039
box and i'm gonna hit down so you can

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,080
kind of hear what it said

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,480
main search search search search

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
so you could see that it's recognizing

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
two search

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,679
uh landmarks search this is one search

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
and this is another one

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,120
however they both have the same name all

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
i hear is search

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
search search so voice voiceover off

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,960
when i have multiple

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,480
landmarks that are the same and they're

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
recognized as the same

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,400
element on the page it's kind of

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,480
confusing for me to be to to recognize

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
what is the meaning behind this search

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,799
versus that secondary search

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,559
um we visually can see that one is for

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,679
like a sidewide search and then the

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
second one is to

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
kind of search for accounts on that

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,880
website let's pretend

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,840
so one way to um allow that distinction

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,039
is to provide aria labels into that

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,120
element

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,559
so if i go to the element that has that

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,360
role and i say aria label

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,799
equals and i'm going to say sitewide

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,039
that way i know that that's the site

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,000
sidewide search and i'm going to try

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
again

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
turn on my screen reader

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,480
voiceover on chrome undefined frame

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,600
landmarks menu

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,120
sitewide search search site-wide search

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,039
you are currently in a voice-over menu

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,960
closing so now you saw that the first

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,200
search is now identified as

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
site-wide search voice-over-off just

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,120
search

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,080
so aria labels um can actually can also

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,760
be used

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,360
um to add additional naming to those

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
landmarks and you could also use aria

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,080
labeled by

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,080
as well but that's just one use case

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,559
okey dokey so

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,720
i also want to talk about when you're

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,520
using labels there's two ways to do it

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
you can have

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,159
an explicit label and an implicit label

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,559
setting an explicit label is when you

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
have

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,120
a label element followed by the input

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,240
element

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,720
and they are paired with 4 and id

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,720
so the label has the 4 which matches the

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,840
id of the input field

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,440
of the input field yes and then uh

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,760
setting implicit labels um is

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,520
the same functionality but it is

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,000
implemented a little bit differently

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
um so you actually wrap the label

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
element

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
and you wrap the input field that is

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
corresponding

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,760
and you could see that there's no id and

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,440
there's no four so there's no matching

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,919
of id with that four

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,960
attribute and then you just have um the

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,919
label

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,679
inside that element as well now i will

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,400
say that though they behave differently

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
and then

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,679
the expectation is the same the explicit

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,880
labels are better supported than

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,760
implicit labels

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,640
so whenever possible uh try to have the

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
two elements

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
separated and then pairing them with the

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
four and the matching id

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,159
are there any questions so far

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,200
perfect so let's talk a little bit about

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,440
instructions

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
you want to also make sure that all of

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
the instructions are close to the input

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,679
field

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
i want to make sure that all the

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,200
instructions are very easy and clear for

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,039
all of your

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,840
users and use the scr area described by

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,760
to describe

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,720
those input instructions if you're not

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,880
including them in the label

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,640
area described by will provide um kind

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
of extended information that the user

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,760
may need and it works similarly to aria

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
labeled by

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,159
where you're going to have to match the

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,240
id of that content

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,880
so let's take a look at what that means

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,679
um so when we look at instructions

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
for forms there's different ways that

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,240
i've seen

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,679
this be implemented so one common

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
uh mistake that i see is the use of

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,480
placeholders

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,320
to provide either formatting or just

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,360
helper text for users

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,000
so for example in this first example i

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
have my

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,039
my name field and then inside the name

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,919
field i have a placeholder that says

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,279
first and last name um so that's

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,039
information that i need to know

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,799
not just to put my first or last name

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,559
but i must include both

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,200
but as you can see as soon as i start

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,120
typing that information goes away

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
so if i had to walk away from my desk

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
and had to come back i see maria

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,960
i see name i say yup that seems good to

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
me i'm going to kind of move on and

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
submit my form

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
and i have completely left out my last

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
name so i lost the content and the

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,320
instructions that that provided for me

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
not only that not only does that content

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,120
go away when i'm typing

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,120
but uh the default for placeholders

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
um does not meet the color contrast so

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
you could see that this is a little bit

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,279
too grayed out

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,880
and if we actually change that color to

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,600
meet the color contrast so let's say

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
that i make that color black

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,640
then it actually looks like

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
pre-populated data

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
and i might just skip that field

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,080
altogether

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,120
so it's best to just just not use

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,000
placeholder data and it's not always

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
picked up by all assistive technology so

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
i would

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
instead opt for doing something like

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,880
this where you can have

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,799
your instructions or help or text in the

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,840
label itself so that it's available

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,279
permanently and for all uh users

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,000
and also you can also do arya describe i

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,840
where you can have a label the input

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
followed by some sort of text that you

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
pair semantically

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,320
so let's take a look at what that looks

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,320
like in the code

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,840
so if we check here we have our form

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,520
and then we have our input field um with

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
the label and then there's some text

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,000
that follows it and we could see that

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
that text has

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,919
an id of name description yeah this is

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
shorthand

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,679
and then you could see that that is the

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,799
same that we are pairing with the aria

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,080
described by in that

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,159
input so if we inspect this element

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,320
let's just see what what um our

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440
accessibility tab tells us about this

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,799
element

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
um so if we go here we can see that it

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,720
tells us

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,679
that it has a computer property

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,400
that has a name of name which is coming

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,039
from

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,279
the label then it also tells us that it

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,320
has a description

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,600
that says first and last name so you

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,559
could see that that's actually coming

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,840
from this

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,520
and we can see all of that information

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,000
being picked up even on the aria

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,520
attributes

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,279
and if i were to turn on my screen

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,559
reader i do want to share with you how

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,520
the arya describe

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
um is picked up

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,640
voiceover on chrome inspire name edit

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,399
text

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,720
first and last name you are currently

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,559
submit so i'm gonna step into it again

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
but just um here for it you're gonna

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,000
hear the label so name

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,080
and then it's going to kind of pause and

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,799
then tell you the descriptive text

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,399
name edit text first and last name you

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,720
are currently on a text field inside of

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,200
a

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,559
voiceover off so as you can see i was

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,559
able to hear both labels

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,480
and that description text that i added

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,480
with um arya described by

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,840
okay perfect

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,799
we also have many input types that you

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,080
can choose to use depending on the

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,440
functionality that you need

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,200
and let us focus on input type of

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,720
image because that one is kind of

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
interesting um

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,640
so if we go down and let's find that

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,039
example

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,520
um yeah so we have some input image type

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,919
which is kind of a functional image so

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,520
if we take a look here we have a form

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,919
we have a label that is visually hidden

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,559
we have an input for search and then an

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,600
another

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,480
input that has a type of

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,360
image and then it has a source for the

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,840
image and an alt text of search

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,480
so let me inspect that element and that

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,399
element

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,240
is this little icon here so you can see

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,919
that it's the input of type image

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,600
i'm going to inspect it go to the

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,760
accessibility tab

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,840
and what i find very interesting about

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,880
this is if we go to the computer

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,600
properties

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720
and we look at the role of that element

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,880
even though we have type

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,960
image this is actually picked up by

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
assistive technologies as if it was a

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
button

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,360
and in fact if i were to as we've

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,360
discussed before

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,720
um buttons do allow submission of forms

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,200
so if i just have

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
some random text in this input field and

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,679
i hit

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,919
that button that has an input

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
type of image you could see that that

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,600
actually does

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,760
submit my form um so that it is

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,679
functioning and behaving as a proper

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,000
semantic button

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,960
and if we go down here you can also see

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,440
that you another way to add an image

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
you can also wrap an image inside a

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,840
button

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,840
and have it that way

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,840
another thing i want to discuss is the

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
different types of buttons that can be

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
inside of your forms

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,120
so as we discussed before um if you

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,320
submit

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,679
so this is type of submit

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,960
it will submit your form like this

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,080
if you include a button that has a

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,720
type of button it will actually not do

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
anything

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,159
unless you add some javascript so you

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
can see i'm pressing this button that's

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,360
just

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,240
a type of button and nothing happens if

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,440
i press

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,240
this button that has a type of reset

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,559
then it empties my form so it empties

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,039
out all of my input fields

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,880
and then if i hit submit then it submits

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,159
another thing i wanted to call out

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
is if you have a button and you don't

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,600
give it a type

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,919
right um so i'm just going to say no

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,919
type

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,799
and it is wrapped inside of a form

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
element

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
then you could see that it also submits

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,799
the form so when you have

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
um buttons that are wrapped around the

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,720
form element

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,159
it defaults to submit a type of submit

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,760
so if you have a button inside a form

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,480
that you don't want it to submit

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,080
your your inputs then make sure that

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,080
you're adding type of button

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,399
okay so next um let's talk a little bit

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
about

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,640
mobile because um those input types can

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,919
also change up um

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,840
the functionality that the that those

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,840
buttons uh that those input types will

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
have uh and before we talk about mobile

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,200
actually let me talk a little bit about

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
this different input type so we

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
not only do we have input type of image

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
input type

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,320
button um we also have as we can see

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,279
here

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,399
input type of things like checkbox and

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,760
radio

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,559
um so if we have radio um

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,320
radio and checkboxes are pretty similar

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,440
in that um they might

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,120
they will both have uh legends right and

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,039
then they'll have like multiple options

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,279
that are kind of iterated through

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,760
um for radio buttons specifically you

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,320
have a combination of inputs and labels

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,960
um and then the same thing will happen

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,000
for

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,960
for the check boxes however the only

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,640
thing that really changes is the type

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,159
so let me just show you what the

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
experience is like with a screen reader

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,519
for both

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,559
types so for check boxes the expected

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
function

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,600
for keyboard is that you're able to tap

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,559
to those

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,080
options and let's see what angular tacos

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,760
whippery popcorn apple

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,120

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,039

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,159
angular tacos react popcorn unchecked

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,919
check box

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,200
you are currently on a checkbox types

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
select granola bar

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,039
unchecked checkbox you are currently on

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,960
a checkbox so we could hear that it

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,760
reads like label unchecked checkbox so

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,399
it also

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,399
the status of it and then it also also

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,799
let me show you what happens if i start

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,000
um checking or unchecking and see how

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,880
that's read

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,679
so i'm going to be able to check and

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,880
uncheck with

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,279
space check checkbox

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,880
uncheck check granola bar checkbox mixed

check apple slices popcorn app mixed

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,360

popcorn angular popcorn unchecked check

checked checkbox you are currently all

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
right now let's take a look at how radio

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,039
buttons are picked up

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
um for radio buttons i'm able to tab to

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,720
the choice once and then using the arrow

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,720
keys i'll be able to move around in the

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,000
in the choices mixed apple popcorn

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,919
angular radio button

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,919
one of three you are currently on a

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,159
radio button selected radio

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,919
react selected radio button three of

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,279
three you are currently on a radio

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,080
button voice over off

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,080
and i will also um check out

00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:01,519
um if we are inspecting we can also see

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
true input field

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,559
and then you could see that it's part of

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,559
that group for choose a framework

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,639
and then the legend is being grabbed

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,639
from choose a framework

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,639
and you can see that um

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,839
okay let me just close this

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
okay so um when we're looking at mobile

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,159
i've included some

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,520
different types of input fields here so

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,720
you can play around with them in your

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,440
mobile web

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,000
um however i since i don't have that

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,359
connected

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,599
yet i have provided some input

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,040
some screenshots of different input

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,720
types across

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,359
different mobile screens

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,000
so here when we have input type of text

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,560
you have

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,159
a normal keyboard come up if you have an

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,800
input type of number you can see that

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,240
only the numbered keyboard comes up

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
and you could see that that's different

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,760
than the type of telephone

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,440
as you can see that the telephone also

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,520
provides those letters

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,119
that correspond to the numbers and then

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,280
you can have a different keyword that

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,040
pops up for color

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,200
then of course you also have different

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,160
types of

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,960
input of keywords coming up for

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,680
different

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,119
types of months type of week and type of

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,560
date time

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,160
and again this will behave different

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,560
depending on what type of device you're

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,560
using

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,079
so looking at autocomplete attributes um

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,640
there is a

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,359
full list of what type of attributes are

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
available

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,720
so you can see that there are a lot

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,680
there's name there's given name there's

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,280
family name

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,880
nickname a lot of of them are available

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,400
for addresses depending on how you break

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
them down in your application

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,400
um so you could see that there are a lot

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,320
a lot a lot um so we want to make sure

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,680
that we are

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,560
matching those um autocompletes to the

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
purpose of the

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,560
certain input field and you could set

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,160
them in the entire form or

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,480
individual input fields and this will

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,359
help um people with cognitive

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
disabilities

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,000
and just um a lot of other um

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
improvements to your application as well

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,520
because people are going to also be able

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,640
to fill out a lot of

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,520
your up your forms a lot faster and move

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,520
through your process

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,400
um so looking here you can set i

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,520
actually have my auto complete off

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,320
for security purposes during

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,599
screen sharing but if you want to take a

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,920
look at this one

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,599
you can see that as soon as you hit this

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
first name and last name that should

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,920
auto populate if you have those

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,880
saved in your browser and you could

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,280
actually set them

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,160
on an input level like you can see here

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,800
so this input let's see

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,160
yeah for let's see you can set them um

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,400
form level like i do here so

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,599
autocomplete on in the whole form

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,680
or you could do autocomplete per input

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,000
um so for my first name i have

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,040
autocomplete of given name and for my

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
last name

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,640
um i actually did not add one for last

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,160
name but you could see the first name

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
and if you want it last name if we go

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,320
back to that

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,520
list list then i would say something

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
like

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,000
family name which you could see is the

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,839
equivalent of last name

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,560
so that's how i would go about finding

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,880
that

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,079
so um there are there are a lot of

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
considerations for

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,400
um building accessible forms and um i

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,000
didn't get to cover everything today but

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,359
i really encourage you to kind of go

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,359
through all of the docs

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
and um explore different types of input

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,040
fields and different

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,119
input types and just turn on your screen

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,839
reader and test it out

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,240
so here i've provided i've shared the

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,400
slides on the

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,760
on the chat here but on the slides

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,760
you'll also find

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,040
the slides for the code snippets that

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,280
i've shared so this presentation here

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,240
and then there's a color oracle which

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,560
allowed me to

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,079
share the different color blindness with

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,520
that color wheel

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,119
and then chromebox which is a free

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,359
screen reader use a

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,400
screen reader used on chrome as a chrome

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,800
extension

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,359
and then all of the different aria roles

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,119
uh states and properties that exist

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,200
um in case you're interested

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,400
particularly around the landmarks role

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,240
those are pretty nice

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
um another thing i wanted to mention

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,359
before we kind of wrap up

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,440
is um the use of auto tabbing um

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,359
and i've seen this used a couple of

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,359
times where let's say that i

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,040
am typing a phone number and then see

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,000
i'm not tabbing it just kind of auto

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,520
tabs for me

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,680
so that i can continue on to the next

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,240
field um i've seen this a couple of

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,480
times

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,280
and this isn't the best experience

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,640
because

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,320
i as a user i'm also expecting to tab so

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,160
whenever i'm actually encountering

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,400
something like this in in

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,440
like production uh i actually start

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,960
doing this and then i

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,240
i tab but then this program also taps so

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,240
i end up in

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,760
the place where i'm not supposed to be

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,320
um which can be very

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,200
disorienting so it's best to allow users

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,000
to

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,000
tab two different input types themselves

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,040
to different input fields themselves and

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,960
not

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,560
introduce any unexpected behaviors that

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,560
the users didn't trigger themselves

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,880
okay that is all i had for today if you

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,240
have any questions feel free to

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,640
post them here in the q a or reach out

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,240
to me

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
on twitter at maria lamardo

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,680
maria thank you so much you have me

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,440
wondering like

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,200
if i need to go through my project's

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,400
website now i'd like send it to our

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,800
webmaster and be like hey

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,240
can you make sure all this is correct

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,400
it's such good information

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,480
thank you so much thank you so much

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,040
does anyone have any questions we have

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,560
about four minutes left i believe

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,599
um let's see

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,240
do you have some comments coming in oh

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,240
thanks friend

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,839
i think this this presentation maria is

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,800
just so

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,359
packed with so much information that you

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,359
think about

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,200
but this makes you consciously really

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,079
think about it and really

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
plan for accessibility and and what

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,359
people

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,560
um you know maybe you don't have those

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,880
challenges yourself but

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,920
chances are you probably know somebody

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,359
who does and

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,319
and it makes you really think about it

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,680
so um i had a question that's not really

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,240
related to um

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,079
the presentation exactly but oftentimes

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,240
people have a passion for this

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
uh you know there was some moment in

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,680
time or some

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,319
event that triggers that passion what's

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,760
there

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,680
something like that that triggered this

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
for you um

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,359
so it's actually kind of interesting um

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,720
so i'm a board-certified assistant

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,040
behavior analyst

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,800
and i provided um behavioral therapy for

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
people with developmental disabilities

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,680
for about eight years before i moved

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,680
into development

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,960
so i moved into development for um

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,480
health reasons um

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,000
i i had to kind of work remotely and

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,280
i that's kind of how i moved into

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
development and i was like i can do this

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,480
from home okay

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
and as i discovered web accessibility i

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
was like wow this is awesome this is

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,319
like

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,920
what my whole previous career was

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,880
fighting against you know because i had

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,040
all of this patients that had um all of

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,880
these devices and we struggled to find

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,720
not only devices that were accessible

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,200
and we could carry and we could function

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,960
but

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,440
then applications that were accessible

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,319
forget it it was it was incredibly hard

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,599
um and so i i had like a decade of

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,280
experience of like all of these

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,720
frustrations from so many people and

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
then when i kind of came into the tech

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,440
side i was like oh my gosh like i can

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,240
i can help find all of these solutions

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,000
and like help

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,520
help you know um so it's just

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
interesting to kind of have that like

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,280
perception and and kind of switch it

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,800
over

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,200
i know um one time i um i

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,200
i broke my hand and and wasn't able to

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,200
like use my hand but i still had to work

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,800
and so i had to learn how to do stuff

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,920
without using

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,560
my hands and it was a little more

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,760
difficult

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,319
than i thought and things and and

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,000
the organizations i was interacting with

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,119
i thought would have taken care of some

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,520
of those issues

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
and we learned that they hadn't and by

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,400
me

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,000
breaking my hand and being vocal about

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,200
it i you know

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,040
could do that so there's always these

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,680
triggers in people's lives that sort of

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,560
create their passions so i'm glad that

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,480
that

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,920
uh that you're you know really

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,520
passionate about this and i used to

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,119
overuse that word all the time but that

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,079
you're really leading the charge on this

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,240
and sharing this

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,680
and empowering people to then go and

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,800
empower their communities

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,880
by making these changes to their sites

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,839
and the way they think about creating

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,359
these forms and

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,560
and and other things so yeah yeah um it

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,400
can it can be easy

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,079
if you kind of start looking at the

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,839
concepts i'm like oh yeah this this kind

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,040
of all makes sense this functions as

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,760
intended yeah

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,520
um i see one question from ingrid is

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,800
lighthouse is still a good use to

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,560
check accessibility um so yes i actually

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,359
use the lighthouse tool

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,280
um when i'm so i'm actually going to

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,040
since i'm sharing my screen still

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,400
um so the lighthouse tool is actually

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,359
built into chrome

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,839
so if you ins uh open your dev tools in

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,839
chrome and go to the lighthouse tool

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,920
there is an accessibility audit that you

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,800
can run in this actually runs in acts

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,400
and you could even

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,720
choose what type of device you want to

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,000
run your report but let's say that you

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,359
i'm going to run a report on webaim.org

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,240
so when you run the report this will

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,040
give you an overall accessibility score

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,160
again this will only catch about like i

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,760
don't know 30

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,000
of the accessibility issues that could

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,560
exist in your site uh so just keep that

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
in mind this isn't a

00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,640
all-inclusive accessibility check um but

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,400
it does tell you and teach you

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,480
about um some of the things that they

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,960
did check for how they pass why they

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,160
passed

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,800
and some of the things that you might

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,480
want to check manually so um these are

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,079
just even good

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,599
information this is just really good

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,440
information just to have and to start

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:22,880
learning about how to test for those

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:22,880
