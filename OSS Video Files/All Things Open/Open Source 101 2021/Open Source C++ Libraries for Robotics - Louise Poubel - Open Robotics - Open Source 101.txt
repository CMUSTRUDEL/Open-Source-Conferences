Description: 
	Louise Poubel, Ignition Technical Lead at Open Robotics, delivered the talk "Open Source C++ Libraries for Robotics" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Gazebo is a widely-used open source robot simulator developed in 2002. Over the past 2 decades, Gazebo has accumulated a lot of code that’s useful to robotics and C++ development in general. For the past few years, the team at Open Robotics has been refactoring Gazebo from a monolithic application to a collection of loosely coupled libraries, called Ignition. These libraries can be used together to build Gazebo’s next-generation, Ignition Gazebo, and they can also be used as part of other C++ projects, especially ones in robotics. This talk will go over the Ignition libraries and what they can bring to other C++ projects.
