Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Danese Cooper, VP of Special Initiatives at Nearform, and Jacob Green, Founder of Mosslabs.io, delivered a talk titled "Software Engineering with Innersource 101" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Open Source is a powerful SOFTWARE ENGINEERING tool. Open Source methods have given structure to collaborative software engineering performed in the public view, have been applied at a massive scale, and the results have changed the world. With Linux on Mars! we dare to dream big for collaboration.

Corporations and industries are now also applying Open Source collaboration methods for their non-public software engineering projects, and itâ€™s called InnerSource.

Join us for the basics of InnerSource; The Who, The What, The Why, and The How.

thank you so much

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,440
and hi i'm just going to go grab the

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,639
presentation

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,639
real fast here there it is

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,880
and we can go anytime you ready jacob

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,240
i am good afternoon everyone

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,640
all right got the countdown clock going

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,680
so that i know that i don't run over

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,640
welcome from austin texas and jacob is

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,640
in space somewhere

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
and we're going to tell you a little bit

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,360
today about software engineering with

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
inner source

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,120
somebody in the last talk which i

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
watched vicky brister just gave a talk

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
about

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,199
um emerging markets and how people get

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
it wrong

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
when they don't treat open source as an

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,680
emerging market when they're trying to

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
come into it

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
um and one of the questions was you know

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
well

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,239
there were two have you seen epic fails

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
was one of them

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
and the other one was uh you know what's

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
the number one thing that causes people

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,640
to fail and vicki's answer was

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,159
not having situational awareness about

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
one's use of open source and i think

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
that's a really good

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
uh piece of advice but i wrote a little

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
private note that basically said

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
inner source was designed to deal with

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,400
this um

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,400
as vicky did i experienced a ton

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,400
of um unintentional failure

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
from companies that were trying to

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,360
understand how to do open source

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
and to me it looked like a set of

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,079
answers that were just waiting for them

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
to see

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
but they weren't paying attention they

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
were they were diving into it

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
as though it was a virgin pond instead

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
of a you know sort of well-traveled

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
waterway

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,880
and um so and good news for consultants

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
we have a lot of business that way but

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,759
not so good

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
for the people actually trying to get a

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,920
good outcome

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
so so anyway we started talking about

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
inner source and you'll hear more about

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,079
it but it is

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
first and foremost at least from my

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,160
perspective intended to help companies

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,479
figure out how to do this better so here

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,479
we go

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
first of all what is open source this is

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
open source 101 you guys have probably

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
heard something about what open source

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,680
is a few times now for our purposes of

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
this talk we're

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
mostly talking about the method of open

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,920
source

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
and that is the way that we work

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,280
together

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,280
this piece of artwork totally strangely

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,720
came from microsoft so um jacob

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
what do you think about that it's pretty

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
interesting isn't it i think it's it's

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
fabulous that you know

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
we're we're here today at uh open source

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
101 it's

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
this is a great event um teaching

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,879
everyone uh introduction to open source

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
and and now inner source um

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,560
it's it's it's a we've come a long ways

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
in the history of open source to be able

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,319
to have microsoft

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,920
uh you know phrasing and and we're

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
seeing this kind of artwork coming from

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
them they've really

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
turned turned a page and they're

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
actually a great partner to work with

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
um when it comes to open source these

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
days

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
yeah i agree i totally agree so this is

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,400
what the reason that we picked this

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
piece of artwork is because it focuses

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
on

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
the how a little bit it has to be open

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,239
it has to be collaborative

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
and you have to show some flex you can't

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
just

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
throw it over the wall and hope it

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
sticks you actually have to pay

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,840
attention

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
the other thing yeah so the other thing

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
that uh we're just giving a little bit

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,200
of a

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
primer here on open source to kind of uh

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
guide you into the relationship between

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
open source and inner source

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
so as you you probably know uh being

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,360
here at open source 101

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
uh open source requires an osi approved

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
license to be called open source

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
so there's a body called the open source

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
initiative that uh everyone is is able

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,640
to to join and participate in

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,319
and i think josh gave a keynote about

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
this there wasn't on a panel

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
that he did yes he did and so the first

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
thing about open source is of course we

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,640
have to choose an open source an osi

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
approved license

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
next thing about open source you know

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
it's about collaborating

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
and the methods and the flexibility of

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,759
collaboration

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,040
in the public so you're here today

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,479
you're all you've heard about open

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,840
source you're doing open source you're

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,360
probably using github

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,040
etc this is all public collaboration

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
as compared to what we're going to talk

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
to in a minute about when you can't do

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,680
it in public

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,199
or we're going to talk about inner

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,840
source

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,680
next slide then the other thing that uh

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
about about open source today is it's

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,560
all about community

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,479
it's about that the the the idea of

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
of community members coming together

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
humans have been coming together as

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
community for a long time

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
now it's developers coming together to

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,680
form communities

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
um and that that that community aspect

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
of software development

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,919
is very powerful and here we see a

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
picture of even how open source today is

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,160
being used

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,360
here in baltimore to

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,240
provide uh engagement between

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,600
the university uh various city

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
government agencies

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,960
and um a community association here

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,400
um and that would not have been possible

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
without the ability

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,840
for open source and the work to happen

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
in the open

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,880
oops for some reason i'm not able to

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,199
advance the slides give me a second here

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
uh that's because i went and looked at

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,720
the chat and was wrong to do that

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,720
apparently i'll get rid of it

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,400
no i can't get rid of it why that's

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
annoying

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,840
there we go all right so now let's talk

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,080
about what inner sources and how it's

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,479
different from open source

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,479
first of all it uses many of the same

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,680
open collaboration frameworks

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,240
and um this is another example of

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,479
collaboration but it's inside an arena

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
it's just for the people that are there

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
and um

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
and it's in barcelona so it's one of the

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
fun things that they do during carnival

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,160
in barcelona

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,680
it's a much more efficient and modern

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,960
way of engineering

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,560
however this is an example of

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,720
efficient modern building engineering

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
this was all made out of components

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
and one of the things that open source

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
is really

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,000
designed for is modularity of design

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,639
so that people can make discrete changes

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
without

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,759
upsetting the whole apple cart and so um

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,280
so that's why i chose this picture but

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
it's

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,160
it's more efficient and modern both in

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,039
the open and in inner source but the

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
differences

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,160
in inner source a lot of times the

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
people that are practicing for the first

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
time

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
are using really old-fashioned ways of

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
working and so it feels really different

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,599
to them

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,800
and then it also supports an open

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,680
community it's just

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
internal to the organization like these

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
ladies from the ut

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,160
crew they're on their boat and they're

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
not dealing too much with anybody

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
you know that isn't on the boat they're

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,599
all pulling in the same direction but

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,080
they're not

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,080
influenced too much by the outside so um

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
now let's go into a little bit more

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
about the kinds of things that inner

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,440
source

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,919
does for people well first of all

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
what does software engineering require

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,280
good software engineering requires both

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,319
discipline

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,840
and scale in modern terms

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
there was a time when you could write a

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,199
small little thing and it didn't matter

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
if it scaled because it was just to

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
solve a specific

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,199
problem but these days everything's

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
happening at such a huge scale

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
and this is one of the things that older

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
engineering cultures get stuck

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
in they don't know how to scale because

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
they've written monolithically they've

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
written for

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
a certain kind of market and then they

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,479
become very successful all of a sudden

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,240
they can't keep up or one of their

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,759
competitors suddenly can do a bunch of

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
stuff they can't do

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
but because they haven't taken the time

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
to think about how they're going to

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,639
scale

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
you know they're tied to older ways of

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
checking to make sure the software isn't

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
gonna

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
new features aren't gonna you know upset

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
the apple card

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,919
they're just they're not able to be

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,039
nimble enough and then they can't

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,919
compete

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,680
so um this is one of the main reasons

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,479
that people get interested in open

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
source

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,120
um because open source is eating their

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,599
lunch but if they try to dive into open

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
source in my experience without

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,279
first learning how to do it within their

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
shop properly

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,680
they really probably going to fail and

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,760
it might be quite expensive and it might

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
cost some goodwill and definitely also

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,399
some brand value

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,399
so um

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,920
you want to talk about the next one well

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
i was going to just kind of give it a

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,440
little bit of framing on the last one it

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
seems like

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
that the open source methods have been

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,480
uh

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,000
successfully used in in the open to get

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,839
scale and discipline uh that's these are

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
the methods we've used and now we're

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
with inner source we're taking those

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,120
same methods and we're bringing them

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,440
inside the corporate firewall

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
to get that same kind of efficiency and

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,839
scale

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
and benefits when the code can't be

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
public

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,800
okay this slide is about um craft and

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
quality

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,680
that's another demand of good software

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,680
engineering modern software engineering

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,760
um honestly craft has fallen

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,720
out of a lot of software development at

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,160
this point as companies decide that

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
time is the great leveler rather than

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,320
quality

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
engineers are pushed with unrealistic

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
workloads

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,720
and in an environment that doesn't make

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
their lives easier

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,480
uh they're expected to wait around for

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
other people but they have deadlines

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
that they

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,640
can't control they've got more work to

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
do than they could get done anyway and

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
then the ways that quality are

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,880
implemented are really painful

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,920
and they don't have time to be craftsmen

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
most of the time

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
and that's that's really sad because at

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,640
the end of the day

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,959
they're artists people who get good at

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,000
making software have a specific

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,560
bent this is their craft and so it

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,320
they get very dissatisfied at work and

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
then of course if they're penalized for

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,320
defects that makes them even more

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
dissatisfied because they don't have

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
good ways

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,680
to get around those issues so um how is

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
it different in inner source

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,920
that was for you oh sorry uh

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
you wanna take this one i'll take the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,800
documentation one

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,200
okay so so the the deal is

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
that um it's built into the open source

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
method

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,200
that there is review so nobody is ever

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,360
expected to just get it right on their

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,160
own in my experience a lot of

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,240
old school engineering organizations try

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,680
to do this they'll institute

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,720
code review but because time is the is

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,160
the prime directive people start rubber

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
stamping each other's code they don't

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,279
really have time to do

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
serious code review and they may or may

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,760
not also have the skills

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,399
so open source changes or inner source

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
changes

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,880
that whole equation both inside the

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
company and also out in the public

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
and that's why things move so much more

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
quickly and at a higher level of quality

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
as

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
as vicky said before it they're just

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
more eyes on the problem but also

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
there's

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,079
a less less linear

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,399
more um parallel

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,480
process to make sure that all these

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
things are actually considered

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
and the way that the whole thing is set

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
up the person who's the gatekeeper for

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
quality

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
really has to do their job and they want

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
to

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,240
because their name is on that merge

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,079
request right

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,279
um all right and then the last one we

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,720
have in this section

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,959
is uh margaret hamilton who wrote all of

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,440
this code this is code

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,079
printed out on graybar and this was

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
printed out

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,519
to support the first successful manned

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
moon

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,160
mission and um you know this is

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,120
documentation because code is also

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
documentation

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,880
so let's talk about this well

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,160
inside uh the corporate environment if

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
you want other people and other

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
developers to be working on on your code

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
if we want to move to an inner source

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
way of

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,079
working we have to document the code and

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,279
we have to provide on-ramps just like

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,440
with open source code

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,399
to build a community to have others

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
contribute

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,920
same thing with inner source we have to

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
document our code and inner source

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
almost acts as a forcing function if we

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
want to have others other developers

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,959
within

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,639
the corporate environment working on an

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,160
inner source project

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,839
and the whole reason that we need to do

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
all of this is as we know mark

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
andreessen noticed that software is

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
everywhere now

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
companies that never wrote software

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,480
before have to have at least a website

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,800
and maybe an app and maybe some other

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,279
stuff just to get their work done

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
and um somebody else came along in this

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
presentation and said yeah but open

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
source is eating software and that's

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
also true

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,720
there isn't a company that you can name

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,399
a name brand

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,160
fortune 100 company you can name

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
that has come up in the last 20 years

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
that would be here if there was no open

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,320
source

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,040
because it is the engine that has been

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,000
driving

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,680
the huge acceleration of technology

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,079
which you might hate or you might love

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,279
but it's here for us and so we have to

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,519
deal with it

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
right

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
now this is a this is a picture of a

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
house that got moved in san francisco

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
recently

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
they used to do a lot more of this and

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,959
now they only do it if the house is

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,440
really valuable so imagine that house

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
is your old company that you work for

00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
that has

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
old ways of doing things and i keep

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
saying old but honestly it could be a

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
new company

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,639
that just isn't very clueful about how

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
to collaborate internally

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
sometimes companies choose

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,639
specialization or

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,920
ownership as a main piece of the culture

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
thinking that that's going to

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,160
make people have more pride in their

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
work and initially that works

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,639
but over time it can become

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,560
warring fiefdoms right so these people

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,040
thought that this house was worth

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
moving even though it was probably quite

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
expensive they had to close a bunch of

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,880
roads in san francisco

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,800
and people who approach inner source or

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,440
open source as a way to fix

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,360
their engineering woes need to realize

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,959
that this needs to be a deliberate

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
process it needs to go slowly

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,720
and thoughtfully it's going to take

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
longer than you think it's going to take

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,880
but there are a lot of companies that

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
have proven to themselves that this was

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,160
worth doing

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
and a lot this sort of started in

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
fintech than modern adoption of this but

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
there are many

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,639
other walks of life i'll we'll show you

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,680
a slide in a minute that shows you all

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
the companies that are

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
talking about their inner source

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,040
successes right now

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,760
and um so basically inner source

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
improves software engineering by getting

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
them

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
into a more modern way of working and it

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,240
also

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,480
teaches all those people that learn

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
those skills how to also contribute

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
properly in the open source world it

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,560
simultaneously does that

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,759
so um so it's pretty valuable that way

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,240
do you have anything else to say about

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,399
this slide

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
great no i'm looking forward to getting

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,079
into the actual example and like seeing

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
like how does this work inside a

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,560
corporation because we've been talking

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
yeah

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,320
theory so this next set of slides is

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
designed to help you know that

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,079
and these are actual slides that i wrote

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
in 2015

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,519
to try to convince paypal to go this way

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
so full disclosure i've been an apache

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,079
member since 2005 but i was also around

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
when incorporated and

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,480
i've been a fan of the apache way for a

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,560
long time apache is the largest single

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
repository of code in the world

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,160
that is licensed under single license

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,440
and also all using

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,800
the apache way which is a set of ways to

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
do things methods

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
that is basically the core of what inner

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,759
sources

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
so here we go here's an example so you

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
can understand it quickly

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,880
let's say for the sake of argument you

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
are in a company that has

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,160
silos has has big chunks of code that

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,399
belong to small number of people

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,279
and let's say that somebody outside your

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
silo

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,680
needs to make a change to your code in

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
order to do their work

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
let's say that they're from uh one of

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,639
the regions and they're

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
there's something that is companies are

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
country specific

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,839
and there's probably also a timeline

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,240
associated with getting this change made

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,079
because they need to get the feature out

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,920
so they send a feature request in most

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,519
companies this is how it works now

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,279
send a feature request because the

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,759
experts are over in the core

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,079
they should write this feature but they

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,199
don't actually know that it's coming

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,559
so it's not been in their planning and

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,799
so they're going to sit on it for a

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,319
while this is very normal

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,959
right so they've got their own planned

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,959
work eventually

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,079
the guy from brazil gets a phone call

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
from his boss and

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,600
we always draw the bosses as swiss

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,480
cheeses for some reason

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,240
um so he gets a call from his cheese and

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,679
the cheese says why haven't you finished

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,199
your work and he says

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,600
i sent a future request i'm waiting

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,440
and so you know the cheese needs it to

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
get done so he calls

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
his peer the other cheese and they have

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,679
a conversation sometimes those

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,480
conversations are quite heated

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
eventually the cheese over on the course

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,679
side will get one of his people

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,640
to do the feature request and yay

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,640
right it's finally it finally happens

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
but the question is what was learned in

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
that process

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
in a lot of companies executives

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
throwing their weight around is the way

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,520
that most work is scheduled

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,919
and even if there's a plan of work as

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
i the first people that used open source

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,640
of paypal

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,280
they had they already knew exactly how

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,760
much time that was taking it was 65

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,679
of their potential work time was was

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
caught up in dealing with cheeses that

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,520
were yelling at each other

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,960
and and changing the order of what what

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
work was going to get done and they were

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,280
sick of it

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,200
and that's this was their original

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,559
reason for wanting to do

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,280
inner source so nobody learns anything

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,080
in i would say in this this particular

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
process

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,160
but what if we thought about the way

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,160
that open source works

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
um this is an important slide because it

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
helps you understand

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,960
why i recommend that 10 of your

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,280
engineering resources should be put into

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,600
trusted committership so the trusted

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,840
committer is a special engineer

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,799
now interestingly enough they only have

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,559
that hat on for a limited amount of time

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
because most engineers were hired to

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,000
write code and also

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,160
get their all of their recognition and

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,919
you know raises and everything based on

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
their ability to write code

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,760
they tend to get pushed in the direction

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,160
of management because it's hard to get

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,919
ahead as an individual contributor but

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,679
in the open source world and the apache

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,200
projects have been studied by lots of

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,760
academics

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,559
there's been noticed a pretty standard

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,919
progression of

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,520
factors of 10 so for a thousand users of

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,799
a given piece of code

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,720
there will be in an apache project 100

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,320
committers who are trying to contribute

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,520
to that code base

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,679
and of those hundred 10 of them will

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
have the facility with the code

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,200
to act as trusted committers and they'll

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,360
actually get a promotion

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,640
in the open source project to be called

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,799
trusted committers

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,080
and they're most of their job they might

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
still write code

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,760
but most of their job is reviewing

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,600
contributor

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,880
patches and deciding if they could be

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
merged or not and

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,919
mentoring those contributors to get

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
those patches better

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,039
before they're merged because it's their

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
job

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,200
their name goes on that merge and if the

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,480
merge you know breaks everything then

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
they're the one that everybody's going

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,480
to look at

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,360
open source uses public

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,919
notice you know public reputation

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
building

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,360
but you can it works both ways if you do

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,640
something stupid everybody knows it was

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
you right

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
and then at the top there might be one

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,039
or two leads in

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,440
a typical apache project there aren't

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,919
any bosses but these people have shown

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,880
you know

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,600
real technical leadership and questions

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,240
get escalated to them sometimes by the

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480
trusted committers all right so

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,480
understanding that progression

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,200
what if instead of the core

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,799
being a blank box to the to the person

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
submitting the feature request

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,799
what if they could see their code and

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,440
read it and make a decision

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,520
about a patch that they might submit to

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,799
get the work done instead of waiting for

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
somebody to do it

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,480
it would definitely feel better to the

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
brazilian engineer because they could

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
actually

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
progress their work they wouldn't have

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,720
to wait around until the cheeses get mad

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,919
right um so engineers like to scratch

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
their own edge

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,760
but this only works if there's somebody

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
to catch the code on the core side and

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,760
that person's job

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,320
he's called a trusted committer and we

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,559
always say put ten percent of your code

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,240
of your resources into this and the

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,799
first time i said that to somebody

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,679
that engineer or the manager said to me

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
can i put

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,080
all of the work that is trying to to

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,200
change in this code base through that

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,520
process in other words

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,360
can i put my own core engineer's work

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,960
through the trusted committer so he can

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
get used to how to do that because he's

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
not going to have a lot of contributing

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
code right away

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,039
from outside our group and i said of

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
course you can and he

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,600
was very happy to hear that and when i

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,000
said why are you so happy about this he

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
said

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,880
here's the thing we hire engineers we

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,840
give them commit access because they're

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,840
supposed to be

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,080
in engineers it's not always a good idea

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,240
sometimes people make need to take

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,120
longer to understand how the whole thing

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,520
works

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,320
and most of our defects are are caused

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,799
by people who

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,000
don't know quite what they're doing and

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,080
then their code isn't reviewed

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,799
sufficiently so this will automatically

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
make my code better quality i know it

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,799
will

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,080
and now i have a non-shaming reason to

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
do it because this person needs to

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
practice i'm like

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,960
great that's excellent he knows exactly

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
how much of a code

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,520
increase he got because paypal's really

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,880
into counting those numbers

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,440
he had 25 the first week that this

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
happened

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,640
so he was already super happy guy right

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
so there's a reward right so now we're

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
going to talk about the rewards of

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,799
working this way

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,840
so once the brazilian guy has been

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
through the mentorship

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,520
has gone through a few iterations and

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,760
now his code is good enough to be merged

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,840
he feels great because he got his work

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,520
done but also he learned something about

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,760
somebody else's code base

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
and any you know learning is always good

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,480
right

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
but you know what

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,960
what about the guy that is doing the

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
code mentorship what is his big reward

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,919
for working in this way

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,559
right it's a good question and and

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,919
um there are a few rewards that we got

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,440
on the on the

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,039
that side oops i'm going the wrong

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,480
direction sorry

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,039
um so what about the tc well first of

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
all

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,440
most big old companies are trying to

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,919
figure out how to turn their code

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
from monolithic meaning it's all in one

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,760
big

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,760
clump to modular

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,679
like those apartment buildings so that

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,080
everything is kind of the same size

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,080
roughly and people can tell people can

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,960
make changes to one little piece

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
without blowing the whole building right

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,279
it's a much more

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,840
modern approach and a lot of shops

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,919
ask their engineers to do this work and

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
they can read up about microservices and

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
about modularity but they don't

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
necessarily know where to draw those

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,080
lines

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
until they've had to explain it to

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
somebody else

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,039
and what we found was a thousand percent

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,360
of the time

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,120
they understand how to modularize after

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,320
they've had to explain it to

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,039
a foreign contributor and so um

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,440
so refactoring clues was the second big

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,640
um

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
wonderful thing that happened the third

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
big wonderful thing

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,679
was that conversation that they had

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,039
with the brazilian guy if they capture

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,520
that conversation

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,559
and extract it from github as we were

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,080
using github

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
and put it into a durable archive that

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,159
is

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,960
um you know indexed then the next time

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,600
somebody asks them how do i do this

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
thing

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
that you know how do i do what brazil

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,159
just did what if one of the other

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
regents wants to do that

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
well now there's an archive that

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,360
explains everything about how to do that

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,320
and so that will save time

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,919
for the trusted committer and also for

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,279
the next engineer because he doesn't

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
have to ask a bunch of questions and

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,080
wait for answers he can just read what

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,960
happened before

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,919
and his first submission will be closer

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
to mergeable

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
maybe mergeable right away so that's

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,679
another

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,080
big takeaway you can ask an engineer to

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
write

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,600
documentation make a documentation

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,000
sprint but it will be

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,840
the best case scenario they'll talk

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
about the code lovingly like it's their

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,799
child

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,159
but if they have to actually explain it

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
to somebody else then you

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,400
start finding out that certain methods

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,159
are known to not be so useful and

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,679
others would be a better way to go and

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,320
there's a reason for that

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,799
maybe it's not a nice reason you you get

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,360
the real story

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,840
all right so and then the last thing is

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,039
once one of these people gets really

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,960
good from the outside of your

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,000
organization and doing something

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,159
you can recommend to new

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,840
new people trying to get the same effect

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,360
that they could be talking to the person

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,080
who has learned how to

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,679
successfully get a pull request in

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,480
merged into the core

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,799
so that is a further piece of respect

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
for

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,640
the brazilian engineer but it also

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,880
creates

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,120
awareness inside the core that there are

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
engineers outside their group

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,159
that are equally good engineers because

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,840
a lot of engineers

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
part of the problem with with the

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,000
ownership culture is people think that

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,480
their own club is the best club

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
and you know see if see if this sounds

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
familiar to you

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840
transactional engineers never think that

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,279
ui engineers know what they're doing

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,120
ui engineers never think that

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,400
transactional engineers understand what

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,559
they do

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,720
turns out there are good engineers at

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,000
all strata of the community it's just a

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
question of whether they've been given

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240
the opportunity and this is a way to

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
grow the engineers in your company at

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
the pace that they take

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,200
the choices that they make to learn

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
about other people's code

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
once you do inner source your best

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
engineers can

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
become known much more quickly and

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,760
that's really valuable for the

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,080
organization

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,159
um we talked a lot about extrinsic

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,159
reward intrinsic rewards

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,400
extrinsic rewards like can we give them

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,679
money can we do bug bounties those kinds

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
of things you have to use those very

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,400
judiciously

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,919
is my advice and there's a quick primer

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
on inner source and now we can get back

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,640
to talking about how to do it

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,640
in your organization

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,520
thanks jason that was awesome to to see

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,360
it from your perspective inside

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,960
uh because you have so much experience

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
question on that what about what

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
percentage of uh

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,360
when done right uh does it does it clean

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,679
up the cheese's time

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,919
well i actually ban the cheeses from

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,760
doing any kind of escalation like that

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,080
and initially it's really hard for them

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,919
because part of that one of the really

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,320
common bad patterns is i'm

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,960
important and i can get things done

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,000
right

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,760
it's just a human trait but they do

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
appreciate getting the time back and

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,799
certainly the engineers appreciate

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,840
getting the time back

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,960
um so as i said that those people that

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,039
had 65 interrupt driven work

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,320
ended up getting down under 5 five

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,039
percent interruption

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,760
and that was wonderful for them yeah

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,520
this is really

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,360
important and really uh uh powerful uh

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,440
returns so that leads us to the question

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,520
of what can interstores do why do people

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
put people do this as we were saying

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
this really does go to help breaking

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,159
down the silos

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,080
inside a corporation to really get the

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
maximum benefit of

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
of your workforce it also empowers

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,960
really empowers the engineers

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,240
uh themselves better culture for the end

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
for your engineering before your

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,120
engineering works

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,679
yeah fewer bottlenecks which is what

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,679
that roadslide is about

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,440
quality seems like it's increasing

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
because of multiple

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,559
reasons but including the culture uh and

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,320
engineers having the ability to to do

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,360
that um

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,640
it's breaking old old habits uh and

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,240
really getting people into the more

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,080
modern way of doing like open source

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,440
open source development so they can do

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,039
it internally as well

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,640
as externally um and really a lot on

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,720
teamwork i'd imagine you know the the

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,320
ability to to work in teams to

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,480
to engage in teams and not always have

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
to go up and have the communication be

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,399
up through the cheeses

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,919
but it's a lot more team focused and and

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,799
cross collaboration between teams

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,000
directly

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,360
um the this is a lot of the benefits

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,960
that corporations are seeing

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,720
from from inner source and denise i'm

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
sure you're you've seen a lot more in in

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,880
your years of

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,720
engagements um yeah well there's also

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,919
vicki talked about the cost

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,200
of losing your newest employees um the

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,520
fact is that the

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,480
the emerging workforce the newest kids

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,320
the ones that you can

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
have for the cheapest money and then you

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,399
grow inside your organization

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
they expect agency because they're

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,679
digital natives

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,720
they're not the same people that i was

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,559
when i became

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
you know a new entrant into this

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,240
industry i was just all glossy-eyed and

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
willing to take on

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,559
whatever you know and i worked at apple

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
first which is one of the most siloed

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,240
companies in the world

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,080
but i was really frustrated by the time

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,679
i six years in i was like there's gotta

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,440
be a better way to do this

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
you know these kids are not gonna wait

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,640
around six years they'll just go find

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,799
somewhere cooler to work

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,559
and that's why older companies really

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
need to get into this

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,000
now because they need to learn it so

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,360
they can keep their

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,679
newest employees happy and truthfully

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,600
it it increases your net promoter score

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,919
as an as an employer

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,200
across all strata automatically

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,520
there's a lot of people doing in our

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,520
source yeah these are just the companies

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,279
that are publicly talking about it and

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,799
as we know from inner source comments

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,320
there's lots of other companies that are

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,720
not talking about it publicly yet

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,840
because they're not done learning it

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,760
so yeah it's it's kind of shocking look

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,720
at how many different kinds of companies

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,440
too it's really

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,880
interesting that way i will say i want

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,279
to call out comcast

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
who's in this picture here comcast nbc

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
universal

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,080
they do an interesting thing which i'm

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,559
hearing more and more people pick up now

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,679
before you do an open source project out

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,240
of comcast

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,640
you have to build an internal inner

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,159
source community around it to prove that

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,679
you can collaborate with somebody that

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,720
isn't in your own team

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,000
which i think is a really good hack

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,000
so all right

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,640
now what makes companies actually

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,320
successful at doing this

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,399
boy there is it's a complicated amalgam

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,480
of things

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,240
so first of all they have to be able to

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
look at themselves they have to be able

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,200
to have an

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
honest look at why this isn't already

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
happening

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,120
and they have to be willing to take the

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,240
steps that it's going to take

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,919
to actually make it happen at least in a

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
seed experiment that lets them see if

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,960
there's any potential for it

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,559
and there are companies where this is

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,000
never going to work

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:50,480
but um you know i'm i'm

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,080
optimistic that almost any company can

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
get something out of this

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,399
um so first thing is willingness to

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,279
really honestly look at your culture

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,240
um the next one is uh to be willing to

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
prove it to yourself

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,600
do the seed experiment and if for for

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,679
instance

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,279
as i found at paypal a big part of the

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,559
problem with executives

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,480
stand between them and the engineers

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,600
you have to make it set you have to set

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,640
it up so that that

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,480
first project is most likely to work

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,159
right in order to do that you're

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,080
probably going to need air cover

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,240
meaning people that are more important

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,640
than you that think this is a good idea

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,440
and also ground cover meaning other

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,440
engineers

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,760
that are tired of the old way of working

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
and really want to see a change

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,960
i have seen successful companies work

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
from ground

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
all the way up but that requires a

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,760
single person who is

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,320
really tired of working the wrong way

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,279
and uniquely qualified to be a change

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,440
agent

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
and those folks don't grow on trees but

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
they do exist

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,000
because we see that we see companies try

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
it all the time

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,480
we very rarely see that succeed but it

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,600
when it does it really succeeds

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,600
um and then they have to have a

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
realistic idea of how long it's going to

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,360
take

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,799
there was in the last decade there was a

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,760
real tendency

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,200
to want to try agile as the big digital

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,240
transformation that everybody was going

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,120
to do

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,080
and i watched a company spend millions

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,559
of dollars on an

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,080
agile transformation that after four

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,640
years and millions of dollars

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
still only had 16 penetration in the

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,279
engineering

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:31,279
community so their change is hard

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:34,640
um in that same exact time period

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,880
at the same company we spent um

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,399
way less than a million dollars and we

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,519
got 25

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,320
right away and that's partially because

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,960
inner source appeals to the very ills

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,440
that are

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,240
most annoying to companies and to

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,799
individuals

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,240
engineers they just need agency to pull

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,559
it off and

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,840
another piece of the puzzle is looking

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,399
at your

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,480
um guardians your culture guardians are

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,880
usually your middle managers

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,519
and you know they're in this an enviable

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
position

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,679
usually they see themselves as directly

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,599
keeping everybody employed

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,240
and they're not wrong about that but

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,879
they tend to love the status quo because

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
it is a known thing and the unknown

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,760
brings risks and people might get hurt

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
and so they're going to need some help

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,280
to be

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,639
relieved of the notion that they need to

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,079
stand between

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,000
progress and and you know the desire of

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,639
the engineers or even senior management

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,040
to get

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:37,280
things done um so you know

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,200
successful companies figure out how to

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,280
finesse that issue

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,839
and um then lastly they figure out how

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
to scale it there's a way to communicate

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
in the company

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,679
why this is a good idea and those

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,240
communications

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,240
are made so that scaling it out they

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,159
don't have to keep going through

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,280
belief that it's not going to work

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,920
belief that it's not going to do

00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,839
anything

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,520
so after doing a seed experiment and

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
seeing how well it works

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,800
you've got to turn those people into

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,720
ambassadors you have to keep

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,839
rinsing and repeating the value you

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,359
create into

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,280
the consciousness of the whole company

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,280
those are all those are some heavy

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,800
things to figure out how to do but lucky

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,040
for you there's lots of ways to learn

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,160
about that

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
if we were going to um if we were going

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,040
to just start

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,320
with a few things to start out with i

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,280
think this is the slider where we're

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,960
going to

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,320
give them some pointers in terms of what

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,839
are those concrete steps

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,720
to get going right so find two teams

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,160
that already want to collaborate for all

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,359
the reasons so they're both

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,160
motivated to get it done set up

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,040
a project where they for some limited

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,760
amount of time

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,320
are going to be encouraged to do this

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,640
they'll get

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
whatever else they're measured on how

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,960
much code they push out or whatever else

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,920
it is goes away and this is the only

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
thing that's important

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,599
can they figure out how to collaborate

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
in this way and then measure what

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,240
they're doing

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,320
don't go crazy with the measurements but

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,359
but convince yourself that there's

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,520
progress

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,280
you can do it by lines of code coming in

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,359
that way you can do it by quality you

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,320
can i've given you lots of the benefits

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,079
of inner source that you can measure on

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
but then notice the ones that you're not

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
measuring because there's probably

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,599
others

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,119
and then at the at a defined end point

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,200
so decide ahead of time we're going to

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,520
do this for a quarter

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,960
or we're going to do this for 10 sprints

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
or whatever your measure is going to be

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,480
right

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,760
at the end of it evaluate what worked

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,680
what didn't what would you do

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,079
differently if you could start over

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,359
and then go looking for another one do

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,880
two or three of these

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,200
take take a good six months to a year

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,839
to validate because once you commit to

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,839
doing it the whole company it's gonna be

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,440
a lot of work it won't necessarily be a

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,880
lot of expense but it's gonna be a lot

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,119
of work

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,880
meanwhile look at what tooling you need

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,480
that you don't have

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,480
you can't even begin to do this if you

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
can't make the code visible between the

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
two teams

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
right but but look at the other bits of

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,800
the puzzle as well

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,480
as you're going along is that enough

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,640
perfect grand all right this is

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
intersource commons we just rebooted

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,599
this website and this is the new front

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,240
page of it

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,599
this is a free place free is in no cost

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,000
that you can go

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,920
get a slack account hang out with people

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,720
that are on the same journey

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,560
and um it's a fabulous community there

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,680
are a lot of resources there

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,760
there are tutorials that were recorded

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,480
with o'reilly there's a workbook to see

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
if you

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,520
understood what you learned in the

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,480
tutorials there's

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,240
um there are over a hundred videos of

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,200
presentations that have been done at our

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,320
conferences

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,359
that answer a wide range of questions

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,040
they're um there are books of six

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,640
books that different people have written

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,839
i wrote a couple of them and there are a

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,680
bunch of others

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,599
uh that give you case studies give you

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,119
practical advice at a deeper level than

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,040
we're able to do here

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,880
um there are patterns books if you run

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,720
into a problem you can see if it's

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,040
already been documented as a pattern

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,040
and what mitigations there might be it's

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,680
just it's a fabulous community and it

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,440
runs under

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,359
chatham house rules which means that you

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,920
won't be shamed for asking questions

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,240
there

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,000
it's been very successful if you happen

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,680
to work in fintech there's also a

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,599
special interest group being run through

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,800
an organization called venus

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,760
which is the uh financial services open

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,560
source

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,040
nonprofit that the linux foundation runs

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,280
and

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960
um the difference there is that all the

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,320
topics are fintech topics

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,480
it's not as broad but if that's your bag

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,400
then you might want to look at that

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,240
and the last thing i have to say is and

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,960
this is a picture from one of our recent

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,240
virtual events inner sources people just

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,000
like open source

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,599
and the people that have come to

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,480
intersource commons are

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,079
just the best i'm not sure how we got

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,000
such a great crew

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,400
um jacob you're one of them what do you

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,079
think uh it's it's a fabulous community

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,160
the you know when we get together in

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,280
person everyone's very welcoming and

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,880
uh etc and uh it's probably one of the

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,839
best communities i've had the privilege

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,280
of being involved in

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,160
over the last couple years yeah

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,440
we really value niceness and sharing and

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,079
trying to help people

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,480
so give us a try see what you think and

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,800
that

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
is the end of this talk if there are

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,240
questions which i'm not seeing any in

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,640
chat but i can't tell if i haven't been

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,640
seeing updates um

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,440
then you know now is the time if you

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,440
haven't done it yet

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,320
no okay so i'm going to ask you jacob

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
what's the first thing that somebody

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
should do when they join intersource

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,800
commons

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,320
the first thing that they should do when

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,880
they join interservice commons is

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,119
introduce

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,000
themselves uh and join our slack

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,880
that's cool number one that's the number

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
one thing

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,640
is to get involved the next thing i you

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,000
know it's the pandemic season but i do

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,319
encourage you to uh

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,319
to to come to our events uh it's a good

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,319
way to get accustomed to the culture and

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,400
then also reach out to us directly

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,599
where a number of us are very happy to

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,800
have one-on-ones

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,319
at any time to help uh new new entrants

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,240
into the community

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,760
we also have a service to come and speak

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,839
at your company

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,440
if that's something that you need and i

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,400
spend a lot of my time doing exactly

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,760
that

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,440
so all right well we are done i believe

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:37,920
i think that's the end of our time

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:37,920
