Abstract:
Open Source is a powerful SOFTWARE ENGINEERING tool. Open Source methods have given structure to collaborative software engineering performed in the public view, have been applied at a massive scale, and the results have changed the world. With Linux on Mars! we dare to dream big for collaboration.

Corporations and industries are now also applying Open Source collaboration methods for their non-public software engineering projects, and itâ€™s called InnerSource.

Join us for the basics of InnerSource; The Who, The What, The Why, and The How.
