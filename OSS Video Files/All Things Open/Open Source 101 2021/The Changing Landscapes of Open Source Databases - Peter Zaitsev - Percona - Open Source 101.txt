Title: The Changing Landscapes of Open Source Databases - Peter Zaitsev - Percona - Open Source 101
Publication date: 2021-04-12
Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Peter Zaitsev, CEO, and Co-Founder of Percona, delivered the talk "The Changing Landscapes of Open Source Databases" at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
A discussion on the changes, trends, and database technologies that are going to impact a business by the end of 2021.

In the current technology landscape, we have a lot of great innovations happening especially when it comes to Database Technology. A few examples include introducing new data models such as time series or graph, which focus on solving SQL at the hyper-scale problem, this has been an elusive solution and scale was becoming synonymous with NoSQL environments. We now have a new Cloud-Native database design coming to market using the power of Kubernetes as well as employing Serverless concepts.

In this presentation, we will look at database technologies changing trends and what is driving them as well as talk about changes to the Open Source licenses and Cloud-based deployment and emerging class of not-quite Open Source Database software.

okay well

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,639
uh thanks for intro and uh let's

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
get started and today we are going to

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,480
talk about

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,520
changing landscape of open source

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,560
databases uh and uh

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,039
with questions you can enter them in q

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
a and i will check that that

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
periodically

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
unfortunately it's not as easy in a

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,719
virtual event to see

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
questions i as i would if you're all

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,320
sitting

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
in the same audience with me and i can

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,559
see

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
somebody if you itching to ask your

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,960
questions but not quite

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
raising your hand yet so we are going to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
talk about

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
uh the change in landscape of open

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,000
source databases through two sides

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
uh one is how the open source is

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
changing

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,840
and the other is how the database

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
technology

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,239
has been changing recently now

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
what is open source or free and the open

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,799
source software

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,159
now uh you can actually see their

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,720
multiple definitions in this case right

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,280
and

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
the two com most common ones they come

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
from

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,560
free software foundation and open source

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,320
uh software uh software initiative

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,439
which you can check out

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
if you need one interesting story about

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,640
the

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
uh well or interesting thing about the

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,759
open source software

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,799
is it's actually much older than many of

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,880
us recognize actually in a

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,200
very early days when the software in the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
industry was just being born the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
software was

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
open source though it didn't have the

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
open source name at that time

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
right the reason for that was the

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,799
hardware and the software

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,799
were bundled in the early day and the

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,159
source code was shipped at that

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,719
early software and it was very much

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,720
expected for early adopters to modify

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,239
the code and physics bugs and

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,560
really add functionality

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
which they needed and then all the

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
changes

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,520
to such source code they're

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,560
shared according to academic principles

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
of sharing

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
sharing knowledge right just like you

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,959
would expect with

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,959
uh open source those days

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,239
now that lasted until

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,760
70s and in

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
70s there have been number of

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
developments which

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
change how we approach software

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
development one

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,800
is ibm was subject to

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
their anti-trust lawsuit and

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
one of the things they did to sort of

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
deflect that was to

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,480
unbundle software and hardware so

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,519
instead of getting

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
hardware like mainframe and software all

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,560
together

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
you could just get a hardware and then

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,440
software would be sold for you

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
additionally so some other software

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
vendors could provide alternatives and

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
compete

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
then i think which is very important

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,720
development at that time is what

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
software became copyrightable item

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
it's very kind of hard to believe those

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
days because so much

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
ip style is really software related

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,680
those days but before

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,239
70s software was not a thing right so

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,720
music right or literature work and a

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,120
bunch of other stuff was cooperatable

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
right but software was not on the list

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
of that item so you couldn't copyright

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,799
it

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
right and once it became incorporatable

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
items

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
multi-billion dollar software industry

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,599
was created

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,720
and appropriately software became a

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,480
major class

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:04,080
of the intellectual property

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,280
if you look at 1980s

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,239
uh and the 1980s this was

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
an era what i would call from minecraft

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,159
open source

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,040
and free software at that time there

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,759
have been a lot of people and you can

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
see here the

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,040
picture of uh richard stallman who is a

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
kind of controversial figure

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,600
those days but he was really very uh

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,120
important folks in that

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,800
era kind of you know creating philosophy

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,479
of uh open source uh

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,880
software and i call it romantic because

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,720
people who would develop create open

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,000
source software at that time

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,400
we're not doing that to uh

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
to get rich we are often creating

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,320
software

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,280
for uh themselves right or because just

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,440
that was

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,479
their passion if you look at the next uh

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,360
decade 2000s

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
right and that is approximately the time

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
when i was

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
myself started to get involved seriously

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
with

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
open source software we see really the

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,479
rise of open source

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,720
and this kind of gets you know some

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,320
really interesting developments on

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
one side it really has a critique

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,800
from established companies in the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,759
marketplace like steve ballmer at that

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,080
time ceo

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:40,479
of microsoft famously calls linux

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:44,400
a cancer right or compares fats

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,680
to to the cancer and obviously

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
microsoft went a long way those days in

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,400
uh

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
embracing and adopting open source but i

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
think there is isn't

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
interesting to see what their position

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,880
was at that time

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,319
and we also had some of them

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,680
significant edges at a time

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,680
in early 2000s stan

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,800
acquired mysql for a billion dollars

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,080
that looked like so huge money for open

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
source business at that time

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,360
right it is now we have many companies

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
in an open source space which are

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,479
valued in 10 billion plus right but

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,319
at that time that was insane amount for

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,680
open source software

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,880
now why those things are happening

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,680
well that was happening because

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,240
businesses started to really understand

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,440
the value of the open source software

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
and businesses did not start adopting

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,599
open source because

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,639
of some philosophical merits right or

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,840
because it is

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,880
you know better but because that came

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
with a lower cost

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,120
short term and long term and allow them

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,479
to be more

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
uh competitive in the end right and open

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
source

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,960
software provides a lot in this regard

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
it offers you

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
direct lower cost right because you

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,800
don't have to pay for licenses

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,880
in many cases you can also see what

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,240
engineers especially smart ones they

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
prefer

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
open source because they can really

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,440
understand it better compared to

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,360
property or software

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,759
which leads to better productivity

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,800
faster innovation and also

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
you can really avoid software vendor log

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,199
in

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,840
with open source software which as

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
many businesses learn the hard way over

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,840
long term

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,080
is extremely inconvenient and

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,199
inexpensive another thing

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,520
uh which is uh became reality for

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
open source i think which is not many

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
people in

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,240
us put a lot of emphasis on but is

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
the international reality is what i

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
would

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,840
call right unlike proprietary software

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,199
open source software is much more so

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,879
insulated

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
from the politics right it's much harder

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
to ban

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,800
certain countries to use open source

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,039
software or it is much harder

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
uh for example for your security

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,560
services to build

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,479
in something into that software right so

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,639
they can

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,879
uh uh really potentially spy

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
on you right for benefits of their own

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,159
countries

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,919
and these concerns are not a big problem

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,399
if you think about folks in u.s

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,519
canada but as i travel to the countries

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,560
and speak to people

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,560
in places like

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:50,320
china or brazil or russia

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
for many of them this is an important

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
aspect of

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,600
adopting open source software and

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,880
supporting software on open source

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,720
software on a

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,600
on a government level right for example

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,959
the biggest commercial bank in russia

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
says burbank

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,680
have moved most of their workloads from

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
oracle to postgres

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
not because they don't like oracle well

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,720
frankly

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
oracle was very convenient for them

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
because of a fantastic industry of a

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
kickbacks

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,519
it created and there is nobody to really

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,800
give a huge kickback in postgresql space

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
but because of all those uh sanctions

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
and

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
complexity of relationship between

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,399
united states and

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,480
and russia they chose

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:44,080
open source software as a safer

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
choice in this regard now what also

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
happened

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
in this time and age is what we have a

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
new generation of an open source

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959
resource companies

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
which have started clearly as a

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
businesses

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,320
uh first right this heavier started by

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
entrepreneurs who say hey

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,800
this looks like it's a great market

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,160
opportunity let us go ahead

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
raise money and we are going to change

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
the world

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,200
and provide high return to our

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,959
stakeholders and fast

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,480
right and unfortunately this approach

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,600
is not always comparable with

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
original efforts and values of the open

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
source

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
right you would see those companies of

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
course that use an attractive message in

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
the

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
open source which as we spoke businesses

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,079
appreciate

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,680
but they at the same time use the

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
approaches which they learned in a

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,720
business schools

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:44,079
in terms of how to build a successful

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
uh business right which is in a lot of

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,240
cases

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,959
preventing people from competing with

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
you right surveillance what we need to

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,240
build

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,839
monopoly avoid communication increase

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,079
stickiness build

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,440
anti-competitive modes and so on and so

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,640
forth stuff what you learn

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,240
in the business school right which is

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,720
quite an opposite about hey how we can

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
share things and build a better world

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
which

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,160
i think open source software is

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
really about at large and literally

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
created

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,920
a lot of not quite open so

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,560
software right you can see

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,519
business we can see open core approaches

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,160
open source

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,640
eventually such as a bsl license

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
we have a shared service license like

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,720
ssdl

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,160
like open source compatible software and

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,360
so on

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,600
and so forth okay

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
let's see i have a question

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,360
okay

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,519
okay let's see so i got a

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,360
questions coming up which i will answer

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200
so we can keep that a little bit more

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
interactive and let me just go through

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
my narrative

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
the question i have is do you think data

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,639
is more secure

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,079
in open source in recent time could you

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,279
share

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,079
any uh data points uh

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,040
not here well i think security and open

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,440
source

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
uh it has been kind of always a little

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
bit kind of controversial

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,160
right because at large extent the

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,880
property

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,040
software allows you more of a security

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,920
through obscurity if you will

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
right because it's not as easy people to

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,720
understand the code

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,600
and so on and so forth right but if you

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
look uh

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,399
at the serious uh hackers if you will

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,279
they are able to uh

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,959
look at the opens at the property

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,160
resource code

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,639
and find holes in it while the benefit

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
of a

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
real open source which while does not

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,839
guarantee security is what

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,880
it is available for review

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
auditing and even hardening by community

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
at large

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,079
right i mean recently you may heard

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,399
about uh

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,959
solarwinds hack for example not quite

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,560
the database right by uh but still right

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,560
and something which happened out there

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,399
required obvious

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,959
design issues right which i would argue

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,959
most likely would be supported much

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,560
faster if a software would be open

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,880
source

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
right in this case before they were able

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
to be

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,959
exploited by some hikers right for

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
a significant period of time and at a

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
large scale

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,040
okay so going back to our open source

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,959
and not

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,360
quite open source uh software

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,480
now the other uh thing what you would

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
see is

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
something called open source compatible

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,320
software

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,600
which is uh uh i think the

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,199
great in terms of that is a very clear

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,880
property software which claims

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
comparability of some open source

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,160
software

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,000
you just have to understand what that

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,079
compatibility means

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
and typically that is what i would call

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,079
limited hotel california comparability

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,639
that means such solutions are typically

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,320
designed making them easier to be

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,360
adopted

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,839
instead of proprietary of

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,880
fully open source edition but that is

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,279
very hard to move

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,000
back right things about you know

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
think about amazon aurora right for

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
example

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,880
which has a whole bunch of

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,519
extra features addition to what mysql

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,320
offers you but if you start using them

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,399
and they are really sexy so it's hard to

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,959
resist not to use them

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,680
when you are stuck with amazon aurora

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,120
right and you

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,199
are really not much less of a host

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
than if you would be running property

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,440
database

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,839
as it is oracle

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279
so how do i take that not quite open

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,839
source developments

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,600
i think that is great from one side

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,800
because you can see a lot

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,760
of investments and higher pace of uh

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
innovation where a lot of that fields in

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,880
the open source proper

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,880
as well but it's also bad because it

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,680
doesn't really provide the full

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
uh value of what true open source

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,399
software

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,199
is uh able to provide and also sometimes

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,600
it gets people to confuse

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,199
that true open source which is built

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,079
according to their

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,440
open source principles they feel open

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,000
source

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,360
in a course right then uh companies just

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,160
use open source term for marketing

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,160
let's look at the next decade 2010s and

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,560
that is what i would call the raise

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,040
of the cloud and the cloud and open

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,320
source is interested because i think it

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,120
brings interest in challenges and open

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
source for changes to open source

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
software

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
but before that let us talk a bit about

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,480
this

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
bait and feature on a switch of the

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
cloud

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,240
promise at all this image

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,920
what you see here is something what

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,040
amazon web services

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,959
used to explain cloud to people when

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,600
people did not understand cloud

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,560
right probably worse by now like 20

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
years ago

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
and that was really compared to the

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,480
electricity right an analogy makes sense

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,839
well it doesn't make sense for most of

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,199
us to manufacture

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,160
our own electricity right it's noisy

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,360
smelly and expensive to run

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,040
runway generators right but

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,959
uh well it is connecting to power

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,480
utility is so cool

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,040
well uh and that really makes sense but

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,079
one thing

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,679
about electricity is what electricity is

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,360
commodity right wherever you produce

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
your own electricity to buy it from

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,160
provider it is

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,160
all compatible and you can run your tv

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
or or your fridge

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,319
you know wherever you choose now the

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,760
cloud providers

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,720
there's uh sort of pivots and

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,880
uh uh start to not just provided

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
commodity services but really things

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
which

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,039
lock you in which would be akin to

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,280
getting the

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,679
you know fridge or tv which only can

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,360
work if you're buying electricity from

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,799
from a given

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,919
electricity provider right not

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,280
not so cool another thing what happened

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
with the cloud

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
is what before a cloud became

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
commonplace there was

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,760
substantial amount of software using gpl

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
license

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,120
which really prevented software being

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,240
distributed

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,720
and used for commercial

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,880
case you would have to distribute your

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,400
changes as an open source

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,600
if you are using

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,559
a gpl software that is not the case

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,840
if with the cloud for example amazon is

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,559
able to

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,120
you know commercially use and make a lot

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,559
of money

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,039
on mysql without having to pay anything

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
to

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,559
uh to oracle right who is the main

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,679
copyright

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,080
holder so it may be not surprised

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
what you see what a lot of licenses

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
recently

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,039
a lot of the companies recently changed

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,760
their license from

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,360
fully open source license to what it's

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,160
called like source available

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,039
licensed often with some restrictions to

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
be used

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,400
by the by the clouds to

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,919
resist the competition

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
another interesting development what

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,720
happens with the cloud

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,000
is what uh while in seventies

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,799
we have the hardware and software became

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
unbundled now they're bundled back

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,400
together

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
if you're buying google spanner amazon

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,160
redshift aurora

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,559
in the cloud right you're not really

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
paying separately for hardware and a

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,480
software you

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,320
are buying the single solution and what

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,600
that means for open source

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,000
is there is no more zero price effect

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
right if i want to run proprietary

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,559
amazon aurora

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,320
or do it yourself mysql on ec2 in all

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,320
cases i would have to sort of

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
you know pay for an instance type and

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,120
it's just going to be slightly more

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,880
expensive

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,760
for uh for amazon aurora right compared

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,799
just to ec2

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,080
instance compare that to to

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,520
software being absolutely uh

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,480
absolutely free right versus paying for

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,720
that

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
the zero price effect let's call in

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
psychology

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,320
is very uh very powerful right there is

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
a huge difference between

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,720
you know paying something and not some

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,400
paying anything

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,400
right uh also uh what we see

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,200
in the cloud what database as a servers

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,960
uh became a trend how to deploy uh the

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,600
database and they tend to be much

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,760
easier than do it yourself open source

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,039
solutions which is of course

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,799
uh very seductive

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,880
which comes after the database as a

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,520
service which i think

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,159
becomes prepared way to consume database

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
software

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
whatever is an open source or not

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,200
database as a service is a huge

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,520
uh trend and what that causes from the

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,000
uh landscape change is that makes it

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,400
much easier to adapt

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,039
multiple database technologies there in

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
the past

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,919
if you would want to run for example

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,080
uh you know in fluxdb

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,320
to store some data you will have to get

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,400
commitment from maybe your ops team

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,640
to run it for you to make sure it's

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
secure highly available and so on and so

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,280
forth

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,760
now you can just pay uh

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,559
to the cloud vendor to get them managed

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,559
in flag zb

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,120
instance right which can be a lot less

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,880
friction and that actually causes a lot

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,640
more database variants

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,559
is being adopted

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,799
one thing is happening with database

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,320
other servers as often happens

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,760
is what became over marketed

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,720
so databases service they indeed provide

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,880
a lot of very

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,159
helpful benefits but often

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,520
it's not as complete as

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,720
you would see for example you may

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,480
have seen recently in recent years

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,720
a lot of uh disclosures about the

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,919
database security issues

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,880
right which often can be related to some

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,000
very uh basic database security

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
practices like hey

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,200
i exposed my database to the whole

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
internet to see a very basic password

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,320
right or

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
i stored backups which were not

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,039
encrypted

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,200
and uh they were just stored on

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:26,000
you know public s3 or something like

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
that right a lot of fails are really

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
connected with

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,440
the developers which do not often have a

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,120
passion of

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,200
database security right are put

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,000
in charge of running databases just

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,360
using database as a service

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,360
right and that is how

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,159
mistakes can be

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,159
easily made

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,480
now as we are using the cloud you can

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,640
see what there are two basic ways you

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,200
can think about using the clouds

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
you can use clouds as a commodity right

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
as i

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,320
mentioned compare that to electricity

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,400
and in this case you use

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
can you instance right and other

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,559
apis which are portable between the

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,039
clouds or

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
you can use highly differentiated clouds

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,480
right

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,679
use the most kind of cloud specific

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,200
features and uh and software and

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
obviously if you choose to use that

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,000
highly differentiated cloud you may get

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
more simplicity even more performance

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,120
but you would uh get in

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,840
on their software give a ride

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,440
in on your flexibility and really have a

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,520
lot of

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,360
software locking in my opinion

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,760
really no one wants to be a hostage

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,799
and especially that is i think the case

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,120
for

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,039
larger enterprises who have been there

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,559
before

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,440
they have uh played many decades ago

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
maybe

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,000
ibm any kind of hardware login and then

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
with

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,480
oracle and other software vendors logged

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,440
into software

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
and they want to uh avoid that and that

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
is why

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:23,600
we see a lot of companies now using

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,400
multiple open source

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,039
databases right among the multiple

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,480
clouds

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,520
multi-cloud and hybrid cloud

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,840
and i believe at enterprise scale that

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,120
is a trend which is going to

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,120
which is going to continue

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,120
now if you look for

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,520
this trend actually there are a number

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,720
of solutions both proprietary and not

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,559
available for this for this

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,919
multi-cloud hybrid cloud but

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:02,159
there is also the emerging standard

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:05,440
of equinoxes as an open source api

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:09,520
for hybrid and public cloud and

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,400
in my opinion if you are really

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,559
uh understand the value of open source

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,279
that is something you should be

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,480
looking at those days and how to run

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,480
databases

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,559
and actually have a database of

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,120
applications among

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,120
their of the cloud

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,799
so what you uh think about the open

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,440
source databases

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,400
and what's uh is happening or should

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,480
happen

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,679
many open source databases i still need

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
to adapt but

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,880
that kind of cloud-native employment in

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,000
multi-cloud and hybrid cloud

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,919
fibernet's api right and related

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,240
solutions in open source database such

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,279
as operators or subways

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,919
uh really uh become a

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
becomes available more and more for open

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,080
source databases

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
and i believe on the next iterations we

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,000
will get the

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,679
uh simplicity which is comparable to

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,480
integrated database as a service

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,559
solution

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,159
on kubernetes but obviously without the

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,240
nasty vendor locking if you look from

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,440
percona side

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
we are also working in this case we now

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,240
have

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,520
operator software for mysql and

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,360
for mongodb as well as

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,400
percona monitoring management uh has

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,799
uh released the early version of

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,440
databases service functionality which we

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,559
are

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,200
planning to launch sometime later

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,600
uh this year which can provide you

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,000
something like gui similar to amazon

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,880
rds and api to deploy and manage your

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,960
open source

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,640
database and completely open source

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,480
package

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,080
okay let's now shift from open source

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,200
and talk about what specific

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,960
developments are happening

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,360
in the database technology

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
now if you think about database

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,520
technology

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
i would split history in just you know

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,159
these

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,320
three big uh groups if you look at the

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,720
early days of databases

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,679
actually there was a lot of

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,840
fragmentations

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,880
a lot of ideas in terms of different

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,320
data models

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,080
query languages and so on and so forth

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,120
but then in 1980s

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,640
90s we really see the dominance of

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,799
relational database

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
and sql language especially in the

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,960
enterprise

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,320
right that's what used to mean

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,880
being a database as we move to the

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,720
internet year and 1000 plus

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
and especially in the cloud where as i

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,559
can say

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,679
it became much easier to innovate of

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,520
different database

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,600
approaches and also we have so massive

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,520
amounts of data to manage and so

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,640
massive amount of use cases was case

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,440
what were

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,399
is a purpose built case-specific

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,399
databases became much more meaningful

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,480
right so we really have a new wave of

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,320
innovation where we have a data models

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
query languages

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,039
and so on and so forth right where

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,159
innovation happens

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,559
so if you think about the current trends

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,840
which i think were off to cover

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,559
is what we see is developers and

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,039
architects are

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,799
increasingly empowered to make database

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,440
technology choices

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,840
right so where decades ago you may say

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,000
hey well our dba has decided what our

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,080
technology is going to support

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,600
those free database technologies now

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,240
it's often

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,000
way developers architects you know what

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,960
database technologies would you prefer

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
to use

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,159
to build the applications we need to be

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,640
built here

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,039
as a business as fast as possible and

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,520
then figure out where those will be

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,200
maintained in-house right or maybe with

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,600
the cloud providers

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,760
and as i mentioned already cloud makes

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,880
using multiple data basic nodes much

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
easier than before another trend which

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,679
is

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
interesting is a microservices

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,200
architecture

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
right why is that interesting because in

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,840
this case

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,279
each microservice can use its own data

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,279
store

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,279
right instead of just one monolith you

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,640
just can connect it to one

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:34,080
uh huge database and that also

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,399
uh creates for much more variety

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
even inside one single database in terms

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,559
of what

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,760
what applications are are being used

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,120
the next component is i think is a

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
multi-store

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
we found now what the storage and even

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,799
computing resources are

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
relatively cheap and what that means

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,200
it's not such a big deal

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,919
to store data multiple times if you need

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
it

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,600
if that makes it more efficient and

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,159
convenient for you

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,080
so it's very common for for folks to say

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,000
well you know what our

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
data comes let's say to operational

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,080
database and then they push it to the

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
kafka and through kafka it moves us to

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,120
one database which we use for search

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,679
another database which we use the same

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,000
data maybe kind of trends

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,440
in a different format for the for

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,600
analytical needs

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
and then it will go to another system

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,880
where we will

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,000
apply some machine learning algorithms

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,120
right all of

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,559
them will store essentially the same the

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,679
same data

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,600
but in a purpose-built systems which uh

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:43,919
help to solve particular problems

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,399
uh problems better now one discussion

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,279
you can see going on right now is well

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,840
should we use an

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,559
sql on nosql or you can also think about

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,000
that as

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,880
relational or non-relation and there are

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
folks

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,679
who even kind of love sql how expressive

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,679
it is and how much it allows

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,960
versus maybe some other developers say

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,159
oh my gosh

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:10,000
sql is so damn complicated

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,559
and using some uh nosql database which

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,519
much more simple interface

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,840
is uh great right and you can see you

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,240
know

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,279
both camps are very successful right now

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,720
with both

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,080
open source sql and noise sql databases

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,360
are growing here is the

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,080
interesting styles from gba engines

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,440
which

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,039
runs different database engines by

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,559
the different languages or interfaces

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,120
and you can see with relational

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,840
databases

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,760
right are a really

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,080
dominant at this point

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
at this point in time right well more

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,799
than

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,519
uh then 70 percent though

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,720
you would see what the sql database are

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,919
not growing

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,480
or relational database as as rapidly if

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,919
at all compared to some other databases

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
right if you think

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,840
over the last

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,640
24 months right the time series

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
databases

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,000
i think one of the fastest growing

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,519
growing trends

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,399
and that makes sense because if you

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,440
think where internet is going with

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,240
arrays of you know devices

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,679
internet of things we are really getting

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,039
a lot of

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,799
time serious data from those data

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,760
sources which needs to be stored and

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
processed

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,679
very efficiently for which relational

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,399
database are not

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:45,440
not also always best suited for

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,279
the questions we may have about

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,840
databases is well

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,640
as we see in the new ideas and new

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,799
trends

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
what are we going to do are we going to

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,519
go and invent completely different data

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
model

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,960
or are we going to extend the relational

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,559
model

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,080
and actually again both those are

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,519
happening at the same time

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,600
you can see sql being extended for

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
example to work with a json

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,120
or conveniently right and there are some

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,720
uh

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,760
other different sql extensions being

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,120
proposed right

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,760
or you'll see solutions like time scale

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,120
db

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,399
right which is a relational database but

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,840
has a storage seriously optimized for

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,279
uh time uh serious data right

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,399
at the same time as uh solutions

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,480
as cassandra or

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,240
montgomery also growing and very

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,480
successful why they

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,480
are

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,559
working kind of starting from from

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,600
scratch

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,840
right now the other uh

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,600
trend i think is uh interesting in this

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,000
case is

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
if we have a multiple use cases for our

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,559
data

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,200
what are we going to use are we going to

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,880
have like a single multimodal database

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,079
or hybrid and directional digital

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,440
databases or

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,480
are we going to use a multi-store

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,839
as a as a trend where we have a multiple

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,280
copies of data

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,320
and you can see again both approaches

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,000
are evolving

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,679
at this point the same time and we don't

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,960
know where it's going to

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,240
uh to win and maybe we will both

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,720
work very well on one extent you can see

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,879
technologies such as amazon aurora right

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,240
or oracle with mysql

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,119
in the cloud he offering heatwave uh

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,119
really optimizing for hybrid transaction

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,200
analytical database use case

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,960
on other hand we see a lot of rates of

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,960
technologies like

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,839
you know redshift or click house which

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,560
are purpose build analytical

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,560
databases

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,200
the next question i see people are kind

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,560
of wondering right now

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,599
is scale up or scale out

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,320
right well uh

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,040
and the question is not about where we

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,000
need to

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,000
we need scale out right because if you

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,440
really look at the massive applications

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,880
you cannot really have

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,160
a application built on one single

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,640
database node but the question is do we

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,160
need the database technologies which are

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,680
really optimized for running on the

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
single node and can

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,599
run with a large environment or should

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,920
we just focus on

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,240
their databases which are always run as

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,040
kind of massively detailed data based on

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,280
the small

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,119
node scale out the jury for this is

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,920
still out if you think about the

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,720
databases as mysql or mongodb

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,200
they are really designed as a single

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,680
node database and scale out layer

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,160
also often referred as a sharden is

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,200
typically built on top of them

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,560
while you see other technologies you

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,320
know cockroachdb

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,200
ugabites thai db uh cassandra which

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
have been designed as a distributed

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
database

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,200
from from scratch right and you can see

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
both of them have a

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,200
different different use cases and

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,359
growing

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,599
from my standpoint i think if you are

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,160
looking for large applications you of

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,560
course

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
will need that kind of scale out but

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,720
with the power

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,119
of modern computers

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,760
for many resources just running having

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,240
single

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,920
database which is not a kind of

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,760
complicated master distributed

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,880
technology maybe a better choice

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,720
if you're running you know wordpress

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
right or some other simple company side

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,280
well frankly you are

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,320
nowhere near the needs of

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,160
a massive scale out database

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,720
finally let me go quickly over

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,760
architecture of trends which are

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,560
uh happening right now right

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,320
one is obviously building the locally

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,760
distributed databases which we

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
uh which we discussed and that's

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,320
important for

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,000
scale out another trend is what we are

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,839
starting to get a database which also

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,960
support with geographically distributed

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,560
databases

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,400
which is driven by performance needs

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,400
because speed of light is limited but

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,359
also by government and compliance

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,160
for example many governments uh require

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,560
what

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,240
data affairs citizens or residents are

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,280
stored in their country not in some

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,400
other countries

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,839
and that means if you want to operate

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,079
uh international

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,400
kind of system you may need to have a

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,280
geographically distributed database

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,680
we see a lot of databases are really

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,520
adapting or even having complete rights

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,160
for cloud native implementations

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,760
running in kubernetes we're calling our

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,480
operators for kubernetes there's no

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,839
exceptions we also see those some

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,720
databases which are just

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,960
bolted on and uh to a specific public

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,839
cloud and only available out there

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,240
now amazon aurora is only in amazon

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:13,119
google spanner is only in

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,920
uh in google uh microsoft also

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,160
has cosmos db which is available on

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,640
microsoft cloud

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,760
only and as i mentioned that is a great

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,200
way for

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,520
compute for locking another interesting

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,240
trend what we see is a separation

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
of storage and compute especially in the

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,599
cloud where you can say well you know

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,720
what we actually want to store our

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,599
data on something which is scalable

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,800
and cheap maybe such as the s3 storage

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,000
and then we want

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
our compute layer to be scaled

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,839
independently

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
right because scaling compute often can

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,280
be done very fast

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,440
while scaling storage in a classical way

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,359
right by adding more storage nodes often

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,560
means shifting a lot of data around

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,280
and that's is fast and the last trend i

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
would mention

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,480
is the hardware acceleration which is

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,800
also very

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,599
uh interesting right and we see some

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,720
databases

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,160
either using gpus or

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,359
some database are being being built

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,839
even to use some purpose-built

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:24,720
accelerators we see a storage uh which

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,920
is designed to offload some functions of

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,800
a database to run

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
on uh you know like your nvme storage

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,480
card

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,720
which all allows us to really get even

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,240
uh more efficient databases in the

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,240
future

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,079
with that i would say that there is a

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,480
lot going on and that's a really great

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,240
time to be involved with

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,040
open source databases right and

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,760
i would also encourage you if everything

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,480
is going on

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,320
in the open source space is to really

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,079
help your friends to understand the

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,520
value of offered through

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,359
open source and if you folks are

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,960
interested to learn more about the

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,480
database specifically

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
open source database specifically and

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,680
not just open source

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,280
we would uh welcome you to also attend

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
your corner live

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,960
online conference which will be

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,400
happening uh

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,599
in may this year and a registration fair

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,720
is

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,800
uh is free the that's uh

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,920
that's all i had for you today and i

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,119
think i have a

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,119
time for a bit more questions

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,599
thank you peter that is an interesting

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,839
talk yeah let's see i think it was some

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,839
other question in the chat was it

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,920
that's you just it was you saying hey

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,440
peter for

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,800
five minutes don't run all the time

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,160
you're like okay phone awesome yes yes

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,920
so any questions

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,800
first right i think you got uh vp case

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,480
question on security others in the

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,560
middle and

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:09,520
despite that everybody else was so shy

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,520
come on folks

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,800
anyone go in once i have a quick

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
question then

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:24,800
oh you have okay go for it yes

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,040
it's a really regarding uh as a company

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,079
that you guys are trying to do uh where

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,920
do you see

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,040
your space maybe not competing with

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,960
other

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,000
uh big techs uh in open source uh

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,520
in open source products but uh is there

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,680
a near-term goal

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,680
uh that you would like to share with us

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,920
well i mean if you look at yeah if you

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,119
look at percona

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,040
right we have our

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,880
mission or the purpose which is public

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,560
is keeping open source open

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,440
right so if you are uh looking uh

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,560
to really embrace open source for real

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,599
right and look at

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,640
and run top for open source databases

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,800
uh uh in a truly open source way

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,760
then we provide software and a solution

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,920
for to do that

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
right and what i mean by that is if you

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,400
think about mysql

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,079
right for example there is of course

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,200
oracle who has uh

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,599
mysql community and mysql enterprise

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,319
with additional often important for

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,000
enterprise

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,839
bells and whistles right and what we do

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,520
at the corner we provide our own

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,280
solution which has

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,160
most of my offset kind of proprietary

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,319
mysql

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,359
enterprise features but in open source

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,400
edition

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:48,240
right and more and we do the same for

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:59,839
uh for mongodb and

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:59,839
increasingly increasing the postgresql

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,760
okay that makes sense yeah

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,280
okay i see troy just was saying thank

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,119
you

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,240
thank you troy for attending

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
yeah and thank you everyone for uh

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,520
attending the first session for the

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,760
technology 2 track

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,119
the next session starts in 15 minutes

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,160
which means

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,359
uh on 12 45

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,240
um yeah let's thanks peter again

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,240
for the

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,880
for the technologies to track

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,200
and if you would like to connect with

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:48,400
him with the links on the slide

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,160
is linkedin and his twitter i can

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,160
continue asking many questions in the

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,760
open source space if you have

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,680
thank you once again everyone thank you

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,920
peter uh

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,040
to be our first speaker for the today

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,480
okay

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:09,839
thank you for uh

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,839
yeah thank you for the engine bye then

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,560
