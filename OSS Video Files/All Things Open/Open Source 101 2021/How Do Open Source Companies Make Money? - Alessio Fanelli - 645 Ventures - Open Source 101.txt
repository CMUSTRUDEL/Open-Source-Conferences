Description: 
	Alessio Fanelli, Vice President at 645 Ventures delivered a talk titled "How Do Open Source Companies Make Money?" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
While it may seem counterintuitive, there have been many billion-dollar companies built on top of open-source software over the last decade. In this session, we will use past examples to answer some of the questions that most often come up: How do these companies monetize? When did the creators decide to build a business around an open-source project? What licenses are used by these companies to prevent larger companies to resell the software on their behalf?
