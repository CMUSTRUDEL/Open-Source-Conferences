Description: 
	Alessio Fanelli, Vice President at 645 Ventures delivered a talk titled "How Do Open Source Companies Make Money?" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
While it may seem counterintuitive, there have been many billion-dollar companies built on top of open-source software over the last decade. In this session, we will use past examples to answer some of the questions that most often come up: How do these companies monetize? When did the creators decide to build a business around an open-source project? What licenses are used by these companies to prevent larger companies to resell the software on their behalf?

	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,080
thanks everyone

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
for joining us today let me share my

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,840
screen

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,120
um we're gonna talk about uh a few

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,960
things today so the

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,240
title of the talk is how do open source

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
companies make money

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,920
but to really understand that uh you

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
need to understand how

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,680
you actually can make money off of

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
software full stop not even open source

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
um so we'll cover a couple of things

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
here and i just wanted to give a shout

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
out to fed the creator of bootstrap

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
the front-end framework for creating

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
this great uh illustration i i want to

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
say previous talk that

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,760
i just reused and his slides were open

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,160
source so

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,520
it shows you how usefulness or software

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,680
and content can be

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
um so we'll talk about how software

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,840
became copyrightable just

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,360
it's kind of a few minutes there uh the

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,760
free software movement and kind of how

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
that

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
has slowly evolved so we started with

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
free software

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,800
open source was kind of the the second

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,760
stage and then we got to this more

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
open court model that people run today

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
that's

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
very different from what free software

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
used to be kind of different pros and

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
cons

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
which we'll talk about and then the dvds

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
framework which is

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
just something that i use to think about

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,840
developer tools open source software and

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
kind of fits in the developer workflow

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
and then we'll talk about a couple case

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
studies of open source and urban core

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
companies

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
um by myself i'm a vice president of 645

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
ventures

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
where i invest in infrastructure

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
software developer tool security

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
we have some open source companies like

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
qjs sergio spenter labs

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
um and i was previously a founder a

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
certain company called smart torvi

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,079
which was a open source and open

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,920
hardware uh home automation ecosystem

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
it basically let you create you know

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,880
your own

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
devices instead of having to use ring

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,439
and the likes um

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
great idea very hard to pull off uh the

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
the amount of expertise you need

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,720
on the hardware is more than we we

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
expected which was a big barrier of

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
entry for people um

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
but it was fun and kind of you know made

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
me learn a lot about

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,119
what really motivates people to pay uh

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
when it comes to open source

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
when you know they can have something

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,840
for free and you know you can reach me

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
that's my email if i'm on the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
sickroofadventures.com channel on

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,959
twitter

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
um and then i'll have the stuff on the

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,720
last on the last slide too

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
so to start you know like

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,160
what what people don't really know is

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
that until the 70s like

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
you actually could not copyright

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
software like

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
it it was just not in the law so ibm for

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
example they would sell their mainframes

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
like

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
the whole source code would like just

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
come include it

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
like with the with the hardware because

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,680
like it just was not part of the law

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,879
um and then in the 70s uh the contu

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
which was the uh busy like the u.s

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
created a new department to understand

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
whether or not

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,280
you know technology uh was actually you

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
know a matter of popularity what they

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
played into the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,319
overall economy and at the time you also

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
had some companies getting started such

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
as

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
microsoft um and what happened is that

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
basically you know people might know the

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
story but uh

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,239
bill gates and paul island were writing

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,720
the first basic version for altair

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
at harvard they then went out to new

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,519
mexico

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
uh they served to sell these devices and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,080
they wanted to build basic for it

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
um at the time it was still a pretty

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
kind of like mixing

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
um scene like it was very like hobbies

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
driven

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
people would want to like build their

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
own machines at home but this was not

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,959
like a mass market movement there

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,879
um and what happened is that bill gates

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
brought a copy of the basic on like a

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
paper tape which was

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
a method of transportation software at

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,200
the time at a home brew

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
club meeting and that tape goes stolen i

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
got replicated

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
and then i got distributed for free to

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
all the members of the club

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
you know as you might imagine bill gates

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,680
didn't like that and he penned this

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,319
um opet an open letter to hobest which

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
was

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,400
um was published on the new york times a

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,879
bunch of publications

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
and basically you know what he said is

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,879
you know like well

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,319
hardware like you can see the physical

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,680
piece of it so you're like you know i

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
have a physical thing kind of cost

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
money like people don't put the same

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,280
thought into software because

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
it's really just like written on a

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
screen

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
so he had this code like who can afford

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,400
to do professional work for nothing

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
which really resonates even today in the

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,560
open source community like

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
if you think about um certain open

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
source projects like

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,440
i don't know even like homebrew you know

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
like the package manager for mac os

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,160
like almost every developer uses it but

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
like it's just an open source project

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
uh being maintained by people kind of

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,639
like thanklessly

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,240
too um and then this really kicks

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,360
started like this discussion in the u.s

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,919
around software

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
uh and what happened is that in the 80s

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,320
apple

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,080
you know was out with the apple ii there

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,919
was this other computing company the

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,160
franklin computer company

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
that basically here it is like apple ii

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
compatible device but what they really

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,479
did

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
is take a lot of the software from the

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
apple 2 and reuse it but they didn't

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,639
really clean it up so

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,080
if you look through the source code

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
there were like comments with the names

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,360
of like apple developers in it things

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
like that

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
apple took them to court they won 1983

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,000
and that was kind of like a landmark win

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,759
for software copyright um and what

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
happened then

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
everything that as i mentioned before

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,520
things were just kind of like default

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,880
open source for a lot like that can all

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
change like

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
everybody was not comfortable anymore

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
with sharing their source code

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,479
everything was kind of like behind the

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
wall garden which you see app will still

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,800
do today

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,440
um and what happened is the at mit

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
there's the creation of this new project

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,000
led by richard salman

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
and basically the you know the legend

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,320
uh is uh stallman was like very

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
frustrated with like a printer that

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
didn't work at mit

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,039
he wanted to fix it but he couldn't

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,680
because like hp

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,240
didn't release the you know all the

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
software

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
the hardware whatever and he created

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,199
this project to basically

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,120
um push what he called free software and

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
he made a very specific distinction of

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
free um

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,400
as in thought not not for us and beer so

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
you can still charge for the software

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
but once i buy it i

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
i need to be able to like extend how i

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,560
want it i need to be able to fix it

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
and this was very you know again like

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
very far away

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,199
from like the business side of it like

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
this was completely kind of like a

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
counter culture movement

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
like it was obvious people you know it

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
was

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,199
people that program on the free time

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,800
they were like very excited about

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
computers but

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
in the business world you still didn't

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
have like the term of like free software

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,759
or like open source it was just like

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,080
coming coming to it um and again if you

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
look

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,199
if you read through the new project like

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
you'll see there's

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,479
a lot of focus on freedom and community

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,520
um

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,639
and this is something that has really

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
started to

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
get lost in the open source world today

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
like

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,199
it's more about what we'll call the city

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
model later but

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
if you think about free software it's

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,280
like a subset of open source

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
so any free software is open source but

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,240
not every open source history software

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,479
and this leads to a lot of you know

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
discussion in the open source community

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
about what is actually free what is not

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
like what licenses

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
are actually valid open source which

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,720
we'll not talk about today because this

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
is more of a

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,800
introductory talk um but it's definitely

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
an interesting area

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,240
um so what what the new did is

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,400
create their own license which was the

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,639
general public licenses still today is a

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
pretty pretty popular it basically

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,880
leveraged this concept of

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
copyleft so what copyleft did is if you

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
use

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
a piece of software that is under gpl

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
license

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
you have to give it open source you

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
cannot redistribute anything that

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
leverages gpl code

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,440
as closed source so this kind of like

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
you know push people to not take open

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
source work

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
and use it for commercial usage under

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,280
you know closed source and

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,280
they were hoping this would lead to free

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
software is kind of being either

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
you know very widespread in the

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
commercial world because people might be

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,599
using you know

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,440
my sequel git or things like that escort

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,759
part of the of their workflow

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
um or just kind of give people

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
alternatives to the closed source so

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
you'll see there's a lot of things where

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,879
um

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
there's a closed source thing so like

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
microsoft office is an example and then

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
there's like

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
open office there's like a free software

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
alternative that has nothing to do with

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
it but it tries to have

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
feature parity so a lot of free software

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
in the beginning was

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
just giving people the choice to move

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
away from closed source

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
and having something that was instead

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
open source and that led to

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
a lot of great projects i mean like get

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
i don't know any developer

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,360
that doesn't use git ubuntu one of the

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,760
most you know popular linux distro

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,560
mysql like very popular database

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
wordpress

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
very popular uh content management

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
system drupal

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,680
so it was overall a successful kind of

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,720
like endeavor

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,320
and this definitely led to

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
over the years to a lot of discussion

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,959
between free software and open source

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,040
because the free software movement was

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,480
community driven it was kind of like

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
everybody you know it's kind of like the

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,959
cathedral and the bazaar model where

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
the free software was like completely

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,959
the bizarre like anybody can come in

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
contribute be a part of the community

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,160
let's talk about it

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,519
um it was people that were doing it

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,920
again for like

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,720
either like scratching drawn it or like

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,959
just for

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,480
the interest of like building something

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
in public versus

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
what you see a lot today is i'm making

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,640
the code part of the code open source

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,480
but i really want to monetize it like

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,880
the impetus was a bit different at the

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,440
time and was very hard to get involved

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
with it

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,760
so today if you want to be an open

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,279
source contributor you're on github.com

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
you sign up you're going to put requests

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
like back then you would have to like

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,560
find the mailing list for a certain

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,640
project you would have to like

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,720
uh do all your work locally then attach

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
a patch to like your email people review

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,880
it will get merged it was like

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
very hard which again goes back to you

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
you have to be really motivated to be in

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
it

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
for it to make sense to you spend time

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,200
doing it um but this has

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
really changed and it really started to

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
change with

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
uh netscape so netscape you know one of

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,079
the first browsers

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
um they they then decided to really

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,600
embrace it it was probably like the

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
first

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
kind of like large fortune 500 company

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,160
so like embrace open source

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
um and what they did is they took the

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
the navigator

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
kind of like the underlying software

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
source code then open sourced it and

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
created

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,920
you know this website called mozilla.org

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
and

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
at the time like netscape was creating

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,519
pretty beat up by

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
internet explorer in the in the browser

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
was um

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,480
and this was kind of like a a way to

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
really expand

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
netscape's capabilities and like if you

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
read back through some of the press

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
release like

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,720
the excitement the next keypad was

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
around really making sure the company

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
would contribute

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
and again this was met with mixed

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
reaction because

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,040
the open sourcing was done through the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,040
the nasca public license which

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,279
was not super accepted by a lot of kind

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,440
of like open source free software

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
efficient aficionados at the time um

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,760
what ended up happening is then

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
that was then transformed into what

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
today's firefox

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
uh which uh as its own kind of like

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,959
mozilla license

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,560
um but this really shows you how the

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
model of free software is moving away

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,920
from community to

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
kind of like community completely

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
decentralized to

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,680
a company using open source it's kind of

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,920
like a model of distribution

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,279
and development with different focuses

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,160
depending on it

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,320
so what happens is that the whole

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,040
overall kind of like licensing

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
goes from copy left which was to gpl and

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
the likes

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,480
to like much more permissive models what

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,800
what permissive means is that

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
if you build property software on top of

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
open source

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
software on a permissive license like

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
you don't have to leave it open source

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
you can like just take it make closed

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
source

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,079
as long as you have um attribution for

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
the project depending on the license

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,680
there's different kind of things but you

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,720
can see that since the gpl

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,160
like most of the licenses being created

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
are like pretty permissive

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
and this is because if i'm a company and

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
i'm doing

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
open source work i want to make sure

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
that anything that happens in the open

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,720
source i can reuse in my property

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
software

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
again big discussion between free

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,959
software advocates

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
and kind of like you know commercial

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,959
companies using open source about

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
what really is open source and you know

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,600
the open source initiative does a lot of

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
work here

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
we're not going to talk about who's

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,720
right who's wrong um but again this is

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,760
like a very complicated topic

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,760
and i've wrote like a 3 000 words

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
article that's on my website about this

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,200
uh that if you're curious you can read

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,399
about but um it's pretty it's pretty

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
nuanced

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
and as you can see like even just in the

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
last eight years

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
like copy life licenses were almost like

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
two-thirds

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,920
of the overall market like if you look

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
at today like copyleft is like less than

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,040
a

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,440
quarter of it this is driven by a lot of

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
things

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
you know even just the defaults that

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
github uses and things like that but

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,079
it really shows you how open source is

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
kind of moving from

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,000
the hobby scene to like a more

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,639
commercial driven scene and like

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,880
the license is kind of reflected in ways

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
that you know having a gpl could deter a

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
lot of people from participating

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,240
so it kind of moves into more permissive

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
ones um

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
and then if you kind of think about the

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
things we talked about like community

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,240
dream and whatnot

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
uh not yet bulb for this great book

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
called working in public

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,279
um and she coined this term of like

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,959
stadium model so like that's kind of

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,240
what open source looks like today it's

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
kind of like

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,839
there's a pitch you know like there's

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
the open source maintainers they're like

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
doing all this work

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
they're managing the community creating

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
software and then like

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,279
everybody else is kind of consuming the

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,800
content but like it's not really

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
participating if anything they're kind

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
of like you know

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
booing or like just kind of like

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,959
tackling you um

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,639
which really changes the dynamics of

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,639
like what gets built

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
uh the support that it needs and also

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
like really

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
increases like the speed to burnout you

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,959
know like

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,880
before like you might have like an open

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,639
source community developing software

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
like people might take a break and why

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
not there's a lot of people that can

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
kind of take it over

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
like in a studio model you might be like

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
one of three maintainers on a project

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
and like

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
even if you want to go away from like i

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,639
don't know three weeks like

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,800
there's a lot of work that you don't

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,959
have to leave behind um

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,800
and again this is also driven by the

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,199
lower barrier to entry so as i mentioned

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
today

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,160
like you just go and get up like i run

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,839
a couple of open source projects like

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,639
you google under today

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
asked me to build something and do this

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
fix this feature

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
what this does is it's great kind of

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
like overall you know it's great that

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,279
more people

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,399
are welcome to participate it's great

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,079
that more people

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
i can contribute to the open source

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
community but we got to be mindful of

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
like

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
the effect that that has some

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,360
maintainers and kind of like how

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,920
it makes it very hard for them to really

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,040
answer everybody so what that has

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
changed is that

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
now open source went from like a very

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
homebrew

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
kind of like scene to like one that is

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
much more driven by corporate

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
involvement

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,600
so if you think about some of the most

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
popular open source projects say

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
say react you know like the front-end

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,800
framework very popular

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,639
built at facebook facebook uses it

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,240
a good part as a recruiting tool they

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
have some great engineers who are like

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,839
core react engineers they can work

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
full-time on it at facebook

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,880
um and they can kind of get react the

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
support that it needs

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,480
given how widespread it is in the web

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,000
um same way tensorflow i like google you

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
know like google has a great machine

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,959
learning team

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
uh people want to work on tensorflow

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
they're free to do it

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
like you know they have all the time in

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,279
the world at google if you are

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,800
if you have a full-time job and you have

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
to maintain something like tensorflow

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,320
it's like it's very hard to do

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
so that has really changed the power

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
dynamics and you can go

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,120
into your you know

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,560
the json whatever else and look at all

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
the libraries they use

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,560
and like look at a many of them the

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
person that runs them

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,079
does it as part of like some work that

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,199
they do at a company it's not like a

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,920
side project like

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,240
a lot of them are like now building them

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,639
at

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
uh larger companies like examples like

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,199
andrew kane who works at instacart it

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
build

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,880
a bunch of great omits are still like

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
blazers stuff like that and

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
it's all work that you know a lot of it

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,199
that gets used in production in

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
instagram and i

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,320
as open source users we get to benefit

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
from it um

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
but it kind of like really changes the

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,399
dynamic of other works and again it

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,680
changes the licensing

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,920
changes a lot of things and so they're

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,720
kind of like two different school

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
schools of thoughts

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
account like open source like and again

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
this is like

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
a lot of the distinction that i do in my

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
head and other people i kind of talk i

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
like about open source versus open

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
quarter

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
um and you know don't tell the open

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,639
source initiative i call things like

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
that

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
necessarily but open source in my mind

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
is a product that is 100 publicly

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
available there's kind of like nothing

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
behind the curtain

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,519
like at any point i can take it i can

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
run it i can extend it

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
i don't need to ask anybody you know for

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
permission or anything like that

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,559
and usually what i've seen is this

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
monetize

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,600
just through services so that can be you

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,160
know

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,160
development services that can be um

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
hosting services kind of like very basic

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,720
things

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,799
that are just things you could do

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,760
yourself but you might not want to do

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,360
and pay somebody

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
and this is you know red hat is on the

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,240
left but like

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
they've really evolved throughout the

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
years they were kind of like red hat was

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,799
certainly the first open source ipo

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,320
in 99 um and initially other

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,320
modernization was through

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,000
professional services training things

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
like that today they have a bunch of

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
kind of like

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,919
software products so it's a little

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
different but

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,760
you know it's kind of hard to think

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,520
about a company 30 years into their

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
lifetime versus like when they started

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
so i put it on the left

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
and then open core is companies where

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
the open source project

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
is like a piece of the overall kind of

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,679
like product suite

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
and that can be a big part or a small

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
part depending on the company

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,960
and the thing that happens is that if

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,799
the company shuts down

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,720
you usually lose the product that you

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,280
know them for so

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
say apache spark like data bricks you

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,559
know it's the company behind apache

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
spark you can run spark as much as you

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,600
want like you can know your

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
own you know workflows anything like

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,559
that when it comes to

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,160
the databricks product that's different

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
like if data breaks shuts down

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
like you'll never be able to get data

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
breaks anymore you know like it's just

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
not open

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,080
so there's kind of like different um

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,720
pros and cons

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
to the two you know the open sources

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,080
everything is open

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
you a lot of it you want to do for

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,520
yourself

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,400
um and certain features that you might

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
want

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
on top of it you might have to either

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
hire somebody to build them for you you

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,160
might have to wait on the open source

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
community to do it

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,480
on the open court model you have the

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
company the kind of like parent company

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
so to speak build the enterprise

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
features for you

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
so that you can get started and then

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,160
kind of get upsell

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
uh absolutely and you'll see it with a

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
bunch of products like

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
apache kafka and like confluent as a

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
company on top of it

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
mongodb and then there's like the

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
mongodb atlas and mongodb

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
cloud i like all these different

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,600
products um

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
so you know going back to what we want

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
to talk about today is how do you

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,280
compare

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,559
convert your open source users into

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,400
paying users

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,240
and we're going to do one open source

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,880
one open core example later

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,679
um but i just mentioned open source

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
because

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,799
in kind of like you know everyday

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
speaking like people don't really see

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,760
open court like even if it's an open

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,039
core company they're still say it's an

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
open source company

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,400
uh so i think this makes it easier to to

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
talk about it

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
and the way you really should think

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,600
about it or at least the way i think

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
about it and it's the first time i

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,280
speak about this publicly i only spoke

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
about it with my portfolio companies

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,559
it's kind of like this

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,720
dbds framework so i'm an engineer myself

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,080
the way you kind of go about building a

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,840
product is kind of like

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,679
these four faces overall it's kind of

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,440
like discover so

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,960
you know i'm a developer i'm looking to

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,720
do a certain thing

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,400
like i'm searching online i'm on github

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,320
and when i can use i'm reading all these

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
different sources and figuring out

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
which tool should i be using like can i

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
trust this tool

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,720
to like you know be maintained there's

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
kind of like a lot of questions that i'm

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,840
answering

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,840
once i take two or three of them like

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
usually what i do is i start building

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
something

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,919
you know so there's kind of like this

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,799
build face i start playing around with

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
it myself

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,720
i might do you know a small proof of

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,640
concept if i think it's good

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
i start you know expanding it to the

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
rest of the team so i'm gonna say hey

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
you know

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
review my code on this or like if we

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,520
were to pour like your micro service to

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
this like what

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,440
would it look like and then all of this

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,600
gets towards getting the product ready

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
to go to production

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
once it gets to production you know kind

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,919
of deploys the next vigor though it's

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
like

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,360
how do we go from the source code in my

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,039
code base

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,039
to having this actually running

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
somewhere that can be cloud on-prem

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
whatnot

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,240
here i require you know a continuous

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,760
delivery tool i need observability to

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,200
know whether or not it's running what's

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
wrong with it what not

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,799
and then the final one is skill you know

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,880
once i have it in production people are

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,679
using it like now i need to maintain it

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
that is you know doing security updates

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,880
that is

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
um scaling the infrastructure to meet

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,679
all the demand that i get

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,679
um all these different pieces of it so

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,760
the the way i think about it and again

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,280
i just wanted to face that this is still

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,559
a pretty amazing

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,559
market and like i don't know all the

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
answers so i'll be happy to be proven

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,919
wrong

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,960
but but he will get their thoughts um

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,640
but the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
the four pieces you know discover build

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
deploy skill i think about this two

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,480
y-axis one of them is like

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
what is the value of like what i'm using

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,679
being open source

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,360
like in the discover and build phase

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,559
like the value of being open source is

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,960
like very high

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,919
that is for multiple reasons first of

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,240
all

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
if the product is open source i'm able

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,360
to really understand

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,679
how does it work what are the

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
limitations i can usually go on

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,400
github and see what are people writing

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,120
in the issues like what are like common

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,799
problems with it i can see how fast

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
these issues get resolved you know so

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,280
like

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,559
for a private dairy product they might

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
have a bunch of bugs that like you're

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
not even aware of

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
because you can't see it anywhere for an

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
open source project like

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,080
you usually know what's wrong with

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
something and like you know might they

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
might not support

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
a certain uh like database connection

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,320
what not

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,039
so the discovery phase is it's very

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
important at the build phase

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,840
kind of like you start losing um how

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,840
useful the open source piece is as you

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,960
get closer to get into production

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,760
so like initially say hey you know i'm

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
building

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
say like cube.js one of the companies

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,960
we're invested in they're basically a

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,080
middleware to pull data from different

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
data source

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,520
in the beginning i might say hey you

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,760
know i need to pull data from

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
um a specific database version that they

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,559
don't support

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
the project is open source i can bring

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,720
my own adapter

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,440
keep it moving once i get to production

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,360
it means that

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,640
everything i needed to build that built

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,559
so at this point

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
in the future i might want to extend the

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,080
functionality of it

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
but you know the reality is that today

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
i'm kind of okay

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,559
with what is there and this is where the

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
value of

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,799
reliability starts to get much more

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,200
important to me than the extendability

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
so you know i'm gonna put this in

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,039
production

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,240
i'm gonna have real users using this

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,400
it's very important that like it works

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,919
and it works as it should versus that

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,480
it's open source you know like

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
if i'm because on the second on the kind

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
of like

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,799
number three and four like deploy a

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,400
scale it's not

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
an engineering decision anymore it's

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,640
like a business decision

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,120
you know like should i use you know ask

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,799
yourself

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
a question like should i use free

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,520
software that like works

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
seventy percent of the time or like

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
should i use close software that works

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
100 of the time it's like

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,400
a no-brainer to like use the closed

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,320
source most of the time

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
but likely we're not we don't always

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
have to make that decision

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,120
so as you get to deploy you start

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
looking at

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,640
the open source uh project it's kind of

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,679
like a

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,919
more of a distribution model so like i'm

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,679
using this library up until now

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,279
if i'm the parent company behind it so

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,640
say i'm conflict you know

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,159
um you are you're using kafka you built

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,679
it you did everything now you need to

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,440
get it to production

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,799
now i feel pretty good about coming to

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
you and say hey you know

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,799
we have like a managed kafka product

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
where like you just put the url

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,679
in your app and like you don't have to

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
worry about deploying kafka anywhere you

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,559
don't have to employ about

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
um you know redundancy uptime everything

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,080
like this

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,600
like that's very attractive as a

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,919
developer and like as an engineering

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,120
organization because that is not core

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,080
to what i need to build so like building

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,200
on kafka

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,760
and like building the actual

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
functionality is like core to my product

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,880
but like running kafka production is not

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,960
core to my product

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,640
so this is kind of like where you start

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,720
seeing a very strong

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
kind of like monetization trigger when

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
companies start to get

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,360
to to production and then the subsequent

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,720
one is kind of like the scale one so

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
first that deploys kind of like can i

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,000
get it to run on the cloud can i get it

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,960
to run reliably

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,279
skill is like okay now i'm like a large

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,480
company i need to build stuff like

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,919
all the logs like um access management

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,480
things that are like very mission

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,159
critical and like if they go bad like it

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
can be very bad from a company they can

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,360
be like

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,320
legal repercussion like it's nothing to

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
joke about

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,480
and again in that case it's like should

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,520
i spend engineering time internally

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
until i build this

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,880
or should i like trust the people who

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
run

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,159
who actually build the open source piece

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,600
of it to also provide me with the

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,360
enterprise features

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,760
um and usually that ends up being the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,320
case what you'll see is that

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
um usually like if you think about kafka

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,840
it has like

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
hundreds of thousands of users you know

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,960
not all of them are pink

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,559
that is because a lot of products like

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
never get to the scale you know

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,320
like you might build an internal product

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
like like for example at our firm you

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,360
know i

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,039
i built uh a lot of our internal tools

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,039
like we don't really need

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,640
you know we don't scale up we have like

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,600
seven users you know so like i'm never

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
gonna be paying

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
like we use redis i'm not going to be

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,000
paying red slabs for their enterprise

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,960
version

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
so you'll see that usually you know

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,480
maybe like

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,320
one to five percent of like your open

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,120
source users are really going to be

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,880
scaling into your enterprise version and

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,880
this is something to keep in mind also

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,000
like as you think about what projects

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,799
actually came with my

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,679
types so uh if a project is like not

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,799
very

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,640
um widely applicable you'll find it hard

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,080
to like build a really large business on

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,440
top of it just because the

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,279
amount of people that are going to pay

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
for it it's pretty limited

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,200
um and yeah so let's go through a couple

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,840
examples and again like

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,720
the rather one is interesting because

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,640
initially

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,080
what people will say is like you know

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
there's never going to be another red

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,200
hat

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
it was uh kind of like a a unique model

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,159
like

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,799
very support heavy um it needs to be

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,279
scaled

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
like by hiring more people basically to

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
support

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,360
users so like it's kind of hard to get

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
to to large scale in a capital efficient

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,559
manner

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,760
um but if you think about the four

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,080
phases and how red

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,600
hat addresses them today so in the past

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,080
they were basically you know

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,799
doing a lot of support on development

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
doing a lot of

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,600
training kind of like things that were

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
not really software there were more like

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
services on top of it which was great

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,159
and got them to a successful ipo

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,480
and then you know most recently to a 34

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,200
billion dollar exit to to ibm

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
um but basically at the discover phase

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,360
i'm a developer

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,159
i need to look for like a linux distro

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
to like run

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,919
my applications you know i'm looking at

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,799
a bunch of them looking at centos i'm

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,600
looking at

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,919
uh fedora i don't know there's a bunch

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,240
and

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,240
i run across try that so the

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
monetization trigger at the discover

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,039
stage

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,480
it's always the same and it's content

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,559
and community like

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,320
you're not going to sell anything to

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
anybody usually when they're looking for

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,840
something

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,200
but you can build trust in your brand

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,440
and your product by having

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,760
a very strong community and by having a

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,000
very strong kind of like content

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
engine which helps them answer all the

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,520
questions that they need to get through

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,000
while they're building software

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,320
on the build side you know i might have

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,840
picked red hat as one of the two or

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,200
three that i want to try out

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,880
i need to make sure that they support

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,080
all the requirements that i have and i

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,760
need to understand

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,600
how to actually build on top of it you

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,520
know like you can build

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
things that work but like they shouldn't

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,320
be built that way and they can kind of

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,320
come back to bite you

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,159
and this is where you can start seeing a

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,840
monetization trigger so

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,440
at this point you'll see a lot of

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,200
companies once they get open source

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,679
companies when they get large they also

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,080
are

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,039
like certification so like courses and

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
like things like that

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,240
like that is for a couple reasons and

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
first of all this

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,520
actually you know i'm a developer i want

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
to learn about it

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,799
because i need to build something at

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
work i can expense the training

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,240
through my organization the second one

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,679
is i'm a developer

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,679
i want to learn a new skill and

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,039
potentially get a new job at a new place

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,440
i want to get a certification

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,200
to kind of prove that i know that and

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,559
again this goes back to the content and

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,880
community so like

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,480
how popular is this project if anybody

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,960
if it's very popular and it's in high

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,919
demand

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,919
more and more people will be

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
incentivized to be certified developers

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,440
in it

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,279
so that kind of drives drops each other

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,559
once we get to the deploy stage it's

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,120
more about the organization

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,200
so we all agreed in our organization

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,120
that red hat is the right way to go

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,399
now we need to get it to a cloud

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,159
deployment if we need to go

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,600
get get it to our virtual private cloud

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,919
we need to get it on prem

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,679
it needs to be deployed somewhere how do

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,120
i do that like before red hat would have

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,120
done the true services

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,039
today they have this red hat openstack

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,480
platform uh that helps you manage like

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,919
your cloud infrastructure and things

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,720
like that

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,279
again like openstack is like not useful

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
to you

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,559
if you're doing in the if you're in the

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,039
discover build phase

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,640
so like it's a gradual approach that

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,200
this company usually have

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,720
so as you mature into like the discover

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,320
build deploy scale you'll see more and

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
more things that kind of resonate with

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
you and the issues that you have at the

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,399
time

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
and what openstack does is it helps you

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,240
manage your infrastructure

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,840
uh you know helps you get your things

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
across different um

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,039
pieces of cloud improv and whatnot and

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,360
at the same time

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,480
they still sell dedicated support so you

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,000
can pay somebody

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,320
to help you deploy it you can pay them

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,960
for a certain sla some whatnot

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,240
as you get to scale again there's

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
different challenges

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
i may say hey you know i want to make

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,600
sure that

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,360
my reddit instance is like able to scale

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,159
like with the traffic that i get

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
it's properly secured um i can maintain

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,159
it very easily if there's any issues

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,600
um in this case you know red hat that

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,000
has got kind of like a red

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,640
enterprise linux version and the version

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
has

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,720
things like you know making it easier to

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,120
deploy security patches with no downtime

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,080
things like that that again like are not

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,320
really important to you

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,720
unless you have like a pretty large user

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,919
base and have certain expectations about

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
how available your

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,720
your service is going to be um so this

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
is kind of like an example of

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,640
a fully open source project where i

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
could still i could get red hat

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
today you know and run it and like do

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,919
everything myself

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,360
and like that will work great but there

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,080
are things like openstack

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,360
and red enterprise that are sold through

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
red at that kind of enhance your

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,320
experience

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
on top of the development on top of the

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,799
open source

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,399
uh project then i'm gonna be it's like a

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,919
similar example you know like

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,519
and you know i want to make sure we have

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,880
time for questions so i'll kind of run

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,919
through this a bit faster

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
um but you're i'm looking for a nosql

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
database

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,240
i look online and everybody's like oh

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,480
i'm going to be here i'm already

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
there it's the best document data store

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,360
or whatnot

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,519
um at the bill phase what i'm looking

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,440
for is does support

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,440
uh my language so like you know i write

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,159
code in ruby like is there a ruby to

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
mongodb

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,120
or an adapter if there's not i can build

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,679
it myself because mongo's open source

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,559
so this this goes back to like the value

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
in the bill face

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,240
of it being open source that like i can

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,200
really understand what their apis are i

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
can understand

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
how to build support for it um i can

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,880
understand

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,559
you know what data models it supports

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,840
very well kind of like um

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,399
what are things that people might have

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,039
tried before that didn't work that might

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,519
be

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,480
you know niche use cases of like certain

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,399
types of like

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,679
geospatial data i don't know things like

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,240
that um

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,159
and here again there's not a lot of

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,880
monetization but what you can do is paid

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,919
workshops

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,519
you know you'll see this has like

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,840
you know they have their own mongodb

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,519
live conference they have like workshops

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,039
within the conference that are paid

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,320
where people can go there kind of learn

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
about building certain things from

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,039
mongol

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,159
things like that um and then you can

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,399
hire people to do

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,440
kind of like more add-on development uh

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,240
and use cases for

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,720
for you as you get to deploy similarly

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,039
to

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,000
to rata it's like i have the database i

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,480
build my app

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,519
i build my product i use mongodb as the

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,360
data store for it

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,200
now i need to get it somewhere on the

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,880
cloud so that i can connect to it and i

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,679
need it to be secure because it's just

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,840
going to have my customers data why not

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,919
now mongodb sells atlas which is

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,320
basically like as a service

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,919
and this removes a lot of complexity

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,519
from the developer like i don't have to

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,279
worry about

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,720
you know my connection to the database

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,960
not being secure like

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,159
putting the database on a server that is

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,080
configured the right way

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,480
and give access to third parties so that

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
really lowers the barrier to

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
using in production which is great

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,200
for because

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,039
they want you to get up to speed as

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
quickly as possible so that then

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,159
once you get the scale and like you need

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,240
even more stuff

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,120
like they have a larger like mongodb

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,840
cloud and the mongodb cloud has

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,600
a data lake house that has uh you know a

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,120
server listing to build functions on top

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
of your data store there's like a whole

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,600
lot of stuff

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,120
that again you don't need in the early

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,720
days but

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,159
you know later on it kind of it becomes

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,039
quite helpful because you don't need to

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,000
use internal

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,480
engineering resources to to build it um

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,559
so

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
you know going back to the helix

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,799
discover it's always about content and

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,000
community

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,080
you know if you're an open source

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
project and you want to build a company

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,519
you need to make sure there's a vibrant

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,320
community around it

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,679
and there's content or and or content

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,040
that supports

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,800
why um your project and product is kind

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,800
of like the best in the category

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,399
at the build level you can do mostly

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
training and development because at this

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,440
stage

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,040
the the customer like hasn't even

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,200
finished building what they're building

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,639
so they still have to prove out from a

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,159
business standpoint whether or not it's

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
worth for them to pay a lot

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,639
uh for your project as a as a managed

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,320
service on enterprise support

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,159
and that's where deploying and skill

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,359
kind of come in so deploy it's usually

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,359
like

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,040
the most basic it's like we take the

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,760
project we host it for you like there's

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,760
not a lot more

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,119
on top of it um and you see this with

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399
open source companies do so like

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,599
wordpress with

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,399
uh a wordpress engine websites like that

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,520
to help you

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,200
post it online and you pay it um and

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,520
then enterprise support is

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,280
you know i have it online usually at

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,839
this point you have like

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,520
quite a bit of adoption for your product

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,920
and like you really need to to tie it

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
down

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
uh so again if you think about how many

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,599
people interact with your open source

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,440
project at the discovery level

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,960
versus how many are going to get to the

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,960
scale level it's like it's

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,000
way less it's probably like again one to

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,960
five percent

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
so you need to make sure that um you

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,839
know you kind of keep cultivating the

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,119
community and reach as many people as

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,920
you want to make sure that then you have

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,440
enough of them

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,280
moving through the funnel um so i know

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,800
yeah we've been going for a little bit

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
now so i think that's

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
that's good um for the talk and i i know

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,480
it's a lot of content and

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,839
i might be doing you know a good talk

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
about this for like 10 hours

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,800
but i'm repeating to follow up with

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,920
people offline if you're interested in

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,720
learning more about it

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,200
um but yeah maybe you know we're gonna

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,800
do q a you can put questions in

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:59,839
the q a slot and i can get to you um

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:59,839
whatever uh works works best

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,359
all right brought brock allen asked many

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,640
of the examples you have are for full

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
products and are quite large

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,800
like mango right hat and those services

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
are easier to offer for monetization

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,240
what about open source library there's

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,760
still some trivial problems

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
i found those are harder to make money

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
from without changing to a commercial

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,960
license

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,280
you know that's that's a good point in

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,040
if you think about some of them i mean

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,400
free companies like grafana might be a

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,839
good example where

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,920
observability is like definitely

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,359
non-trivial uh but you you're

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,200
you're starting as an open source

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,480
project so a lot of people are just

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,320
gonna deploy themselves um and then you

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,760
kind of the the flip side of it which

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,000
is kibana which is like the

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,800
elasticsearch product which is a fork of

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,680
grafana

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,000
that has instead the spll license so

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,920
kind of like very anti-open source

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,760
it really depends on whether like just

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,400
how your com company wants to play with

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,720
it you definitely have more chances to

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,320
monetize with a commercial license but

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
you have to think about again

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
like the community that you build like

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,640
if you have like a very

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,839
open source hostile like license like

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
yeah you'll have more chances to

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,200
monetize but like

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,359
less people are gonna want to use you

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,280
because they don't really see the

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,560
value in it and like they're worried

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,920
that a lot of the work

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,760
they might do also like doesn't doesn't

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,839
actually contribute to the open source

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
word but like it contributes more to the

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,280
company behind it

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,800
um so it's definitely interesting and i

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
think we'll see more changes

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,839
over the next few years you know i think

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,560
this is a

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
changing changing category and you have

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
some

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,359
some great people kind of thinking about

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,119
it uh and you're seeing how

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,560
a lot of open source companies can get

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
very very large i mean i haven't checked

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,200
with mongodb's market campus but it's

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,800
like

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,280
the tens of billions of dollars so

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
i think if you want to build the thing

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,839
is like if you don't want to build a

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,119
large company

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,280
but you might still want to make money

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,400
off of open source there's definitely a

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
lot of ways

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,000
that you can do that with it's kind of

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
like outside of scope

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,200
right now because it's like it really

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,680
depends on what project it is

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,520
if it's deployed you know server cycling

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,599
inside there's kind of like a lot there

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,720
um but a good example would be i don't

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,599
know projects like

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,480
like tailwind css i don't know that are

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,800
very popular

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,400
might be hard to monetize but like you

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,599
know you still have ways to kind of

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,079
bring the community in

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,720
um but yeah it would be great to learn

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,720
more about

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,560
how people do it you know i think like

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,400
again the maintainers are like the ones

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,280
closest to it and they might be seeing

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:43,440
things that are

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:43,440
