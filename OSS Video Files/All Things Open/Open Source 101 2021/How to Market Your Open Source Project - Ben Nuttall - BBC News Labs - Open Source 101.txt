Description: 
	Ben Nuttall, Software Engineer at BBC News Labs, delivered the talk "How to Market Your Open Source Project" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Having great software is one thing – getting the word out to your potential users is another. Sometimes the more popular project isn’t technically better, they just managed to reach their users better.

There are plenty of ways you can find ways to reach your users and grow the adaptation of your project – finding both end-users and potential contributors. Not all of them will work for you, not all of them will be possible, but there are lots to consider and things you can try out without too much effort.

You don’t have to be a budget, and you don’t have to be backed by a company but if you have the support of a company or bigger project you can make use of that to promote the project.

So what does it take? This talk covers:
Defining what your project is, who it’s for and what problem it solves
Identifying what people did before your project (is it now easier or faster?)
Git & GitHub
Welcoming contributors
Open discussions & open roadmap
Active Q&A community
Documentation
Social media presence
Having a website
Blogging
Logos, branding & merch
Featuring & amplifying community members using your project
I’ve had different experiences running open-source projects, some easier to market than others, some with backing from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, others without support. My projects have seen millions of users, and dozens of contributors.

okay so

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
uh welcome everyone this is a talk on

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
how to market your open source

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,719
project and um this talk is mostly not

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,480
about marketing

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,400
uh it's about things developers can do

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
to make their projects more marketable

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,039
and you'll see what i mean as i go

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,279
through this

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,160
um so first of all i'm i'm ben nuttall

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
and um

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
i'm a software engineer at bbc news labs

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
um

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,480
i'm based in cambridge in the in the uk

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,559
i used to work at the raspberry pi

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
foundation i was community manager

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,800
and um while in my time there i managed

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
a couple of open source projects

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
gpio zero and pi wheels um and i i

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,879
maintain them um

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
now as well and i i contribute to

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,559
opensource.com which you might hear a

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,239
lot about it's um it's mentioned quite a

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,360
lot in the conference

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:58,000
um and this is that's where you can find

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,239
me on twitter and my github as well

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
so what this talk is not so this is not

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,440
uh like i said it's not really about

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
marketing it's about um

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,720
developer tools so uh it's not about how

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
to buy a billboard

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
to emphasize your project it's not about

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,840
google adwords it's not about

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
being a social media pro or being able

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,640
to go viral

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
it's not about running a mailchimp

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
campaign or google analytics or getting

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,720
a celebrity endorsement for your project

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,240
what it does focus on is the things that

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,000
you can do as a developer

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
to make it easy for you and others to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,119
promote your project

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
it's about things you can do to promote

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,439
your own project and about how you can

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
leverage

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,079
any potential company support that you

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
might have available

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
so what does marketing mean when we talk

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,360
about an open source project so i'm

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,320
talking about reaching new users

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
advocating for its use showing how it

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
can help people

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
sharing case studies building a

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
community around your project

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,600
and promoting a bigger project so if for

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,880
instance your project makes another

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
project

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
you know a lot more appealing because

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,680
it's got this cool tool that's so that

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,479
somebody's built uh on the side of it

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
um so these couple of examples just to

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,200
give you some

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
context of my background um so these are

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,560
two projects that i created

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,120
um and still run um so gpr0 is a

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,000
is a python library um it's a zero

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,280
boilerplate alternative to a lower level

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,599
um library that people used to use um so

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
the the pros to this were that it was

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,840
it's supposed to be easier for beginners

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,959
um it's a nicer experience for more

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
advanced users

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
and it's intended to replace the need to

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,400
use the lower level

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
uh version it actually just sits on top

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,239
of it provides a nicer interface

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
um and pi wheels another project i did

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
uh

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
is it's a pipe and package repository

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,400
that provides pre-compiled packages

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,440
especially for the raspberry pi uh this

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
makes using pip

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
the the package manager for python in um

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
install things really fast on when

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
you're on a raspberry pi when

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
without this project it would take a

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
long time because you'd have to compile

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,879
everything

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
um and um it's very easy to go back

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
to the old way if you if you if you want

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
to compile it yourself and do

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
do that for whatever reason it's very

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
easy to do that um

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
so in terms of marketing these two

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
projects so

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
actually to to reach people where we

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
cheap when it came to go zero um it

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
required a change in behavior

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
whereas pi wheels it didn't it was just

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
there was a configuration that meant

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,959
that it used this repository as well as

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,040
the other one

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
um so i had to actually market it just

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,239
to get just to reach people to tell them

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
about it so that they would start using

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,200
it

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
it requires learning something new so if

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,519
you've been doing it the old way for a

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
long time

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,599
this is a new thing that you've got to

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,920
learn to be able to take advantage of it

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
whereas with pi wheels there was no

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
learning involved that you just it was

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
using a different index to provide

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
things in a faster way than

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
the alternative and you didn't have to

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,360
change anything to be able to get access

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
to it

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,200
um with 2.0 there's lots of tutorials

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
out there i'm kind of competing with so

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
if i'm trying to teach people

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,680
you know trying to reach people with

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
this i've got to you know produce lots

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
of materials to

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,400
um for people to come across them

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
instead of always finding the old

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
you know there was something like three

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
or four years worth of tutorials out

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
there

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,280
of this is how you flash an led this is

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,439
how you read a button press this is

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
how you use this particular sensor and

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
so it's quite hard to um

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,320
and it's also quite hard to measure the

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,239
success of it because

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
it's something that was pre-installed

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,440
and um

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,880
uh you know we didn't really have track

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,120
of how you know beyond

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,919
anecdotal and seeing people using it in

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,080
the wild and

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,199
using social media to talk about it it

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,840
was quite hard to measure the

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,400
success whereas with pi wheels there was

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,720
just this

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,919
automatic collection of detailed usage

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
statistics so we

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,840
we knew how many people were using it we

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,199
knew what they were downloading

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
and there was lots of information

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
available about how successful it was

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
without

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,160
needing to don't do anything extra

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
um so the fundamentals of of what i'm

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
talking about

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,400
with regards to marketing are getting

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
access to

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
being able to provide the source code

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
and getting access to it uh an ease of

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
installation so actually finding it

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,919
where you would expect to find it um

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
good documentation i'll talk a lot about

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,280
that

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,039
um things like choosing a good name is

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
really really important because it makes

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,440
your

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
it can make it much easier to actually

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
get the word out about your project

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,880
if it has a name that makes sense and um

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
it's something that

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
people can confine and understand um

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
choosing appropriate license there's

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
obviously you know you can see a whole

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
talk about

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
how to choose a license for your project

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,840
and lots lots about that but um

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
that's important as well um so things

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
like sensible versioning

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,320
so using semantic versioning for

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
instance backwards comparative

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
compatibility concerns and being aware

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
about what

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
you know how your users are going to use

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
it and when you when you deprecate

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
things how

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
how you actually you know look after

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
your project in a good way that will

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,320
um you know make it an easier sell but

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
it's actually a

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,160
stable and well looked after project uh

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
and also meet you know

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
all sorts of different ways of meeting

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,720
users expectations

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
um so it's important to point out that

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
there's tons of material in this

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
um some of the sort of suggestions and

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
different angles that you can you can um

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,479
approach uh in in this not everything is

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
going to be suitable to you and your

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,440
project your company or your

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,319
your open source project um there's

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
certainly not

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,440
everything you know prerequisites to be

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
able to release your

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
uh your software um with mine you know

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
the first thing was was to do was to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
test something out get people using it

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,560
uh get some feedback early on

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
um yes a little bit of documentation is

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,919
helpful at that point but

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,319
you know you need to um you know you

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,720
need to you can find time to

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
to do proper job of everything over time

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,199
so things like if i mention having a

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
website or

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,039
having comprehensive documentation or

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,319
having social media and using social

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,680
media for your project

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
they're not things you need to do on day

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,520
one they might they

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,800
probably don't make sense to do early on

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
until you've actually established

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
something

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
um that is worth continuing um but

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,160
they're all

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
they're all things that you might want

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
to do at completely different moments

00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,919
you might never want to

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
create a website for your project

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
because it doesn't make sense but as i

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,479
say

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
all these things are worth considering

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,440
at some point and um

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,199
and they can happen at any time um so

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
choosing a name i mentioned so

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
um you know just some basics really

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
short

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
short precise and descriptive and

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
ideally obvious so a well named project

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
would be

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,039
something that uh is is well scoped to

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,360
the

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,319
to the domain space of your uh of you

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
know what you're the problem you're

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
trying to solve so don't try to

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
kind of over promise and claim that it

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,720
it does much more than it does by

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,240
giving it uh such a name um

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
so check what's available so if you're

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
thinking oh this would be a really good

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
name for my project well is

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
if it's a you know if it's a python

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,120
library is that name available

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,639
um on python package index or if it's

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
you know javascript is it available on

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
npm that's kind of thing

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
so check its availability or whether

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
there's something else out there

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,879
using that name you don't want to get

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
confused ideally it would be something

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
that's pronounceable

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
um so people can actually talk about it

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
and remember how to spell it

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
uh and not get confused with other

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
projects like i said um so is that you

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,400
know think about is there a convention

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,840
for this type for this type of project

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,759
so if it's an extension for

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,879
something like flask or django or

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
something like that

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,560
uh react maybe if you know is is the

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,479
convention that they are

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,400
you know flash hyphenated something um

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,680
and then think about sort of how you use

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,800
the project name

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
um so in um in python for instance the

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
module name that you import

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
it's it's not enforced but it's

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
recommended that you use lowercase

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,159
that so when you import it but the um a

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
lot of python projects out there

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
actually use a different capitalization

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
in the way they talk about it in text

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,919
rather than

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,200
the actual module name um

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,360
and so yeah it's just something to think

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,399
about whether you in your kind of

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
what i'm talking about marketing which

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
you know as i say could be anything just

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,040
tweets and talking about your projects

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
and things but

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,640
the way that you use that term um can be

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
really important as well just to think

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,839
about how you want it to be

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
written and have a bit of a style guide

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
for it um so

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
bad things to hear about projects so

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
these are kind of examples of

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
things that you know you don't really

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
want you know you want to avoid

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
falling into traps that will make people

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
turn away from your project so

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
you know not having documentation and

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
you know telling people to

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,640
read the source code having the source

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,399
code in some bizarre old

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
legacy system or something that people

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,880
can't find very well

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,399
um you know people say oh it's not worth

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
the pain trying to install it or you

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
know you have to

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,240
do it some really weird thing all those

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
things are

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
avoidable and you can do you can do a

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
lot to

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,519
just help your users out and they will

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
have a good good sense of um

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
uh of belonging within within your

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
project

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
um good things to hear cutting contrast

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,839
so there's a great community it's a

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
great thing to hear about about a

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
project

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
has great documentation much easier much

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
faster

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
has a really nice api it's easy to get

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,399
started they accepted my pull request

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
uh it's easy to extend all those kinds

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,880
of things the sorts of things that the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
stuff in the contents of this talk will

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
hopefully gear you towards

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
people being able to say things like

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,079
this about your project

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,600
uh so um defining your project so what

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,959
is your project so if you come up with a

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
snappy one-liner so

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,040
it's x for y or it's a simple way to do

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,680
x or it's a python wrapper for

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
x uh who is it for is it for beginners

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,360
is it making something easier for people

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,640
um you know is it for advanced users

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
it's going beyond what

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,839
what alternatives do is it perhaps for

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,399
both like i said with gpr0

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
is it for people using you know this you

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,760
know using this protocol

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
on linux or you know this protocol on

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,680
mac when you know the

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
the contrast is that there are already

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
libraries for other things so

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
who are you targeting and actually

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
making that clear in the in the

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,800
description of the project is

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,320
is quite key um you know

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,240
um so you know if it's for people using

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
people who use docker on the mac but

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
want a command-line interface you know

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,120
something like that it's

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,279
if you can get get uh to the bottom of

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
what that is that's really important

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
what problem does it solve so is you

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,440
know does it make it easier for people

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
is it faster

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
is it cheaper does it automate something

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
um what's the alternative to this so is

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
it better than this other project or how

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
do i

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,800
migrate from this other project uh are

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
all things to to consider

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
so your users will have certain

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
expectations so if

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,440
if there are a debian ubuntu user or

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
other linux distributions they might say

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
well can i

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,399
install it or whatever the package

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,079
manager is for that system

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
um and it would be an expectation that

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
if it is for those types of people

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,920
that it is available in the normal way

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
uh if it's a python package or a patent

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,839
library then you know can i pip install

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
it you know i wouldn't i would expect to

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,160
be able to if you just told me

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
you've made this cool python library um

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,880
instead of saying well it's you know you

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
download it from this website or

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,920
something like that

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,839
if it's a node package npm obviously um

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
you know it doesn't have a github page

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,760
and can i find it in some reasonable

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
place i'll talk about that next as well

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,639
uh where are the documents

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,079
where's the docs where the documentation

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
um are they on read the docs that's

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
where i don't expect to find a lot of

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,399
documentation

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
or are they within the github repo for

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,760
instance uh is there a website for the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
project you know is there a homepage

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
that i can

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,639
find and read more about it um so

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
with github repository uh you know you

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,519
there are different ways of doing you

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
can either have an organization that you

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,000
you put your repositories in

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
or you can and it's quite common to

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
actually this is kind of pattern of

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
having

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,279
a repository of the same name of the

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
organization i'm actually creating an

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
organization

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,200
for the project and then having kind of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,839
side projects

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
that go alongside it also within the the

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,560
organization

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
um so you'll see that quite a lot with

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,079
the examples on the left-hand side the

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,880
middle column is

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
um things that belong to um an

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,240
organization but have a different

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
different name so examples of multiple

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
projects within a

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
an organization and the one on the right

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
people's personal

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
account accounts like mine on the bottom

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,200
there um

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,600
the great thing about um what github

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
does

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,320
is it will maintain if you move it from

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,680
a personal repository to an organization

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
no matter how many times you move it

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
around or rename it the links will

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
always kind of

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
follow through so or if you if you start

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,639
it in your personal account

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,000
you can then later on create you know

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
this has actually become a project

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,680
it's worth having its own organization

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
now uh which i've done with

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
you know many of my projects they've

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
started in my personal account move them

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
over but the old links if anyone clicked

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,160
um or if anyone has any any old links

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
they're not dead there

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,079
they're still um still around they still

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
work

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
um so welcoming contributors is really

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,199
important thing so um

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,800
make it easy for somebody to set up your

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
project for the development so they can

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
actually you know they say oh i found

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,839
the book and i want to try and fix it

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,600
providing developer documentation to get

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,839
them started is really important

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
um otherwise you know they're kind of

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
guessing and they'll start asking you

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,000
know asking you questions and asking you

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
to deal with it or maybe they'll just

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,959
give up

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,120
so just providing some docs to be honest

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,480
i i i quite like having document

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,920
developer docs for my own projects

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
because i remember how

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,440
oh how do i set this up again on a new

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,480
machine or something like that

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,639
really useful to have um

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
and having tests um if you've got a if

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
you've got an open source project and

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
it's out there without any tests you get

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,560
a pull request

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,399
you know you're going to have to

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
investigate whether that pull request

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,040
is good or not um and whether it um

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
breaks any functionality

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,959
you know if you have tests it will tell

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
you like it broke all these all you know

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
it broke all this old functionality that

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,639
you

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,240
tested in um so really important to

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
to do that and it also lets the

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
contributor know that they haven't

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
broken any

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,440
old functionality um

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
laying out your expectations of your

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,000
contributors so

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,839
if you know if you actually um

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
have a process of how you manage them

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,920
and how you deal with them you know

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,760
um and whether you you know you're

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,959
currently taking pull requests

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
you know at that time if you're busy

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,320
working on other things it might be

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,639
worth just letting people know that

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
it could they could have to wait a while

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
um

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,880
responding actually responding to issues

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
and pull requests is really important

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,519
even if you just say thanks i don't have

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
time to look at this right now but

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,399
um you know thanks thanks for your

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
contribution and you know i'll take a

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
look soon or

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,959
if somebody has a question just be able

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
to answer them you know kind of welcomes

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,360

point out there's a book or there's a

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,160
typo in the docs or here i

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,120

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,360
request saying thank you was you know

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639

and accept it that kind of thing uh and

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
also name like naming the contributors

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
and you know if you maintain a list of

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,279
your contributors anyone who's

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199

something and said you know

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,480
gave me some basic code to get started

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
and somebody else did a lot of the work

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
or i did

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920

and actually naming them and thanking

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,000
them in the change log is is is quite a

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
good thing as well so

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
um for instance this is one of my recent

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,279
change logs uh

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
you can see through all the bullet

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
points that are listed you know so

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
we we added this feature to this class

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,440
uh thanks to jack william for doing that

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
you know

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
it's it's a nice thing to be able to see

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,440
your own name in some of these projects

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
um and mentioning them in in any of the

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
comments i'm gonna be talking about a

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,560
lot of the cons and stuff coming up but

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
um

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,399
mentioning people in that and saying you

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,399
know like i said jack williams

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
uh ad added this feature to the to the

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,120
library and um

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,959
you know he'd get well this person gave

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,199
us this idea or she did this

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
um you know it can be really a nice way

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,839
to include people

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,280
and show that you know anybody could do

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,199
that

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,120
uh this is one i really uh really like

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,919
my friend sam she um she did a pull

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,600
request to

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,360
a um a library a little while ago and um

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,559
sort of it turned out that the you know

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,760
this had already been fixed in a

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,280
development branch but they hadn't sort

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,959
of pushed it up or something and

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
um so they ended up not actually

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
accepting a pull request but

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,919
they thanked her anyway and said well

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
we'll add you to the contributors

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,960
because you did a considerable amount of

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,039
work to to do this it was a few

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,240
different so you know

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,760
they you know i thought that was a

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
really nice thing to do just you know

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,400
and it's so easy

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,480
um to to keep people happy that way

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,120
um so issues and and questions

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,559
so um what i like to do is signpost

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,440
people to where you want them to go

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
so you might say look check the faqs

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
first if you've got a question

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
because we might have already answered

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
it and yes i'll be talking about faqs as

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,799
well

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
um if you if you've got an issue if

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,160
you've found a bug

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,080
you know tell them to go to the github

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,200
issue uh issue

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,880
um system and and add an issue there and

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
it's really important if you you know

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
if you're getting issues to have

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,080
templates to if you especially if you've

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,120
got kind of a project that needs

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
um different kinds has different kinds

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
of issues so

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
different you know there's a difference

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
between somebody reporting a book

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
somebody

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,720
suggesting a new feature or somebody

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,919
who's you know found something

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
wrong with the documentation you might

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
have different ways that you want to

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,600
collect the information that

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,720
they need to provide um

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,400
and for q a you know i kind of for a few

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
years had a lot of

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,760
issues just left open in my repo in my

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
repositories that

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
where somebody's really just asking a

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,080
question like is it possible to do this

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
or can i do this or what's the best way

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
of doing that

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,919
and that kind of issues that never go

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
away so you end up like having

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,600
you know you might have over 100 issues

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,600
or something and really you know

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
you could you could if you move them

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
away you know you actually looked at

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,039
things that need

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,520
fixing in your system um

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,120
uh you know it you know you've got a lot

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,840
a lot fewer issues to deal with

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,120
um so actually i opened uh github

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,039
discussions on one of my

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,160
um repositories recently and said if

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,919
you've got a question that's just a

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,559
question and not a book report

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
just answer answer it here ask it here

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,720
either i will answer it one of my

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
contributors or

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
somebody else in the community can can

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,440
help

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,280
i also direct people to things like

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,720
stack exchange so there's a stack

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
exchange for say the raspberry pi

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
community for instance and that's a good

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
way to

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
send people to this type of request um

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,320
and and raspberry pi have their own

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,679
community forum as well so

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
just pointing people at those different

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
places saying this is where you can get

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
help

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,960
um just helps um from polluting your

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
issue

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,480
issue tracker uh faqs like i said

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,160
um really important and these are

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
actually part of the um on the left-hand

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
side this is the gpio0 documentation has

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
a page on faqs

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,880
um so there's lots of things that kind

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,080
of well if you're if you're not used to

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
this the way we do things in this

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
library is

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,039
here are some of the things you need to

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
know um and on the pi wheels project is

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
that there's actually a website that's

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,039
the

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,559
host the repository and it makes sense

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,480
that it's on there

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
so um there's a list of questions that

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
we've come up with and we add to this

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
all the time if

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
we get a question actually that's that's

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
that would be good for other people to

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,320
know

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
you know we'll add that as well um and

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
we

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
even have an issue where people can

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
reply and say you know

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,280
i've got a question that i would like

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,280
you know i think should be featured on

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,400
the faq

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,080
so issue templates i mentioned um so

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
this is the gps zero ones we've got you

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,760
know things for

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
suggesting an api change uh reporting a

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,039
bug

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,400
and suggesting a new device to be added

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,000
we've got kind of different

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
forms that we want people to fill in to

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,120
say this is the information especially

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
for a bug report because

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,159
you know we need to say well which um

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,799
you know which python version are you

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,640
using what

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,799
pi model you know this thing and the

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
other

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
uh on the pi wheels project we do

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
something slightly different because

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
there's a whole website powering the

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,320
the the index the repository um

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
we you that every every package within

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,480
the system has

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,919
its own project page and down the bottom

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
there's the there are these links you

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,919
can see the blue buttons on the left um

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,679
so you can say we'll check if there's an

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,320
open issue about this project

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,760
about this package and if not then you

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,039
can create a new one using the buttons

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
below

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,799
and then that takes them to the github

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
page with the issue

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,320
the new issue page open with the

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,799
appropriate template and

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
the title filled in there are more

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,240
complex things you can do to actually

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,679
populate the the entire contents of this

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,880
but um

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,799
um but you know that's always done

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,840
for this and there's lots more lots

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,200
other things you can do with it

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,760
so documentation um i think is really

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,440
important

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,480
so um using an appropriate tool for your

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,080
uh for your documentation um so

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,840
for instance i use sphynx which is a a

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
documentation based on a documentation

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,080
system based on

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
uh writing documentation in restructured

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,919
text

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,640
um it has a it has the ability for you

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,320
to mix

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
kind of automated docs like things out

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
of your docs strings so every

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
you know listening all the methods and

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,799
all the classes available

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
and the parameters they take um mixed

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,799
with

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,240
stuff that you've written especially for

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,480
for the documentation

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,840
um so kind of a whole page of

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,039
information about something

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,240
um so sphinx is a really good project so

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,840
um

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,600
actually hosting the docs so read the

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
docs is a website that will host your

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,720
sphinx project

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,559
um which is really useful really you

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,080
know really easy to set up

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,280
uh so every time you push to you'll get

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
a repository it rebuilds the

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,640
documentation

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,080
from the latest branches and if you get

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
a pull request it can build

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,120
the docs for for the new branch as well

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,480
um and it will host it for you and it's

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
in a place that you know you would

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,760
expect documentation to be

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,360
uh you can also host it on your own

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,159
domain as well

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,039
um so hosting multiple versions of your

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,799
docs so

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,320
for every version of your of your

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
project that you release so you're not

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,480
you know

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,960
version 0.5 0.6 0.7

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
and so on you you you can freeze the

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,559
documentation at those at those

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
release points so that somebody can go

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,960
back and say well i'm using

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,919
i'm stuck on version 0.7 because i'm

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,600
um for whatever reason i need the docs

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,440
as they were at that point

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
and sphynx just gives you that for free

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,280
so it uses the the tags within your git

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
system to

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,000
ensure that people are reading the docs

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,360
at the right at the right point

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,880
um so

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,520
uh i also like to include things like

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
diagrams um so this graph that you can

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
see

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,279
um is is generated we're using something

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
called graphics

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,480
and the the diagram with the raspberry

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
pi on the on the right is a is a

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,520
wiring diagram using something called

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
fritzing so obviously that's not going

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
to be

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
very likely for for the majority of

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,200
projects but this is a you know kind of

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,919
domain specific type of um uh

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,640
of diagram for for this type of project

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
and then

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,080
there'll be lots of others for different

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,200
projects but that kind of thing would be

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,440
really useful

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,960
so this is um kind of a quick overview

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
of the difference between types of

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,320
documentation

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,279
um so you've got reference docs like i

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,679
mentioned that's

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,120
a list of methods within a class and all

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
of the automated doc strings that have

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,039
been pulled out of the source code

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
all of the types that all the parameters

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,240
are supposed to be and what their return

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,520
values are that kind of thing

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
and then there's the other type which is

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,279
something you've written especially so

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,760
it's a page it's more like a tutorial

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,279
or it's explaining a concept um and

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
sphinx allows you to do those kind of

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,320
things

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,600
you can use other systems as well

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,559
there's um

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,799
there's a website

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,840
documentation.divio.com

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,000
the friend of mine created this

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,520
this this whole documentation about how

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
to document projects

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
called the documentation system um and

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,120
it's

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
it teaches this concept of there being

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,880
four types of documentation so i've kind

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,279
of roughly talked about these two

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
um so there's tutorials which are you

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,000
know useful when you're studying and

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
they're very practical

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,159
um contrasted with you know the

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
reference docs that i talked about but

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
then you can split those two into two

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,120
again and say well there's

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,480
how-to guides which are kind of a mix

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,919
between the two

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
and explanation as well so if you're

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,880
just explaining a concept

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
it's not something somebody's following

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
along and typing something in line by

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
line

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,360
you're just teaching them some concept

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,200
and a tutorial is kind of

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,640
about learning but it's but it's also

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
you know they might be following along

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
as well

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
how-to guides are kind of problem

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,640
oriented so they're you know how do i do

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
this with this library

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
um they answer questions and they help

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
people solve a particular problem

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
um but if somebody needs to read up like

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,360
oh you know what was the method call

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
though you know what was the um

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,720
how do you you know what's the the name

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,120
of this uh what parameters does this

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,159
take

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,240
that's the kind of thing you need to be

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,080
able to look up by reference so having

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,039
all four types

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,799
they can be within the same

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,600
documentation system but they should be

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,120
separated so you shouldn't have

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,000
you shouldn't mix them together which is

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
what a lot of people do

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
um so in terms of contents what i like

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,799
to see in documentation

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,440
um a good landing page that just says

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,279
what the project is and what it's for

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
page on how to install it and how to do

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,960
upgrades

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,960
um page on getting started and giving

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,360
people some examples

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,440
um pages that explain the concepts if

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,799
necessary so sometimes it kind of takes

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,720
a bit of a it's not just a case of

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,279
learning a new api

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
it's about well what is this library

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,159
what is this approach

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
um and how do i how do i use this

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,440
approach to solve problems um

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,520
in contrast to to other alternative

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,960
libraries

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,039
um development uh sorry uh api and cli

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,279
reference as well so

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,080
like i said those pages that have just

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
the reference

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,279
material on what all the methods are

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
that kind of stuff i'm not saying you

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,360
shouldn't have that's important as well

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,200
should be in there um developer docs

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,039
like i said before

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,320
just saying how do you how do you build

00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,840
build this project uh

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,679
on your own machine how do you run the

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,799
tests how do you install the you know

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
what are the dependent

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,159
dependencies in order to be able to

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,520
build the docs that kind of thing having

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,159
all that documented on a page

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,640
you know really useful as well change

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,000
log

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,440
so like i said before about having

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,320
different versions it's really important

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,000
to let people know

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,799
well actually in version 0.8 we

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
deprecated this thing in version 0.9 we

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,320
um you know that's when we added this

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,480
feature so if you're on an older version

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,840
you won't have it that kind of thing

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,440
um i added a migration guide guide to

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,440
the gpr0 docs um

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,080
a little while ago just to kind of help

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,600
people who are still using the old

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,880
way of doing things and say well this is

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
what the equivalent is of that

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,399
which has been quite useful as well and

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,880
then having a page

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,480
when you know when appropriate um to

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,480
list your deprecations and any breaking

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,000
changes you've made um

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,399
so with with gpro0 for instance we

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,480
released naught point releases uh we

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,840
called them beta and we said you know

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,200
anything's you know anything could

00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
change at this point if you're trying it

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
out

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,360
you know give us feedback but it's

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
likely to change and then once we kind

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
of got to a point where we thought well

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
this is stable we're happy with this

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,320
we release 1.0 and then we've done point

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
releases from then on we haven't

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,520
broken the backwards compatibility from

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
that point onwards

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
now we're looking at making a 2.0

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,039
release at some point and

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,120
that we would you know we've started

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,320
working on what that what those changes

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
are and listing

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,840
what the changes that people need to be

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,120
aware of um which is

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,120
you know really useful to people

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,679
um so a migration guide like i said so

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,600
this is um a way to help people migrate

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,799
their code or or introduce new concepts

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,240
to them if they've done something

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,120
different before

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,840
um it's uh it's really good to be able

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,760
to compare

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,600
and contrast different examples so if

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,080
you if this is how you do a hello world

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
and they'll

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
the old way this is how you do it in my

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
library um

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
cover all the areas that are included

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,080
and kind of enough to get you know get

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,279
somebody

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,399
um get somebody going and if there are

00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
any gaps you're like oh actually you

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,640
know we haven't

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,399
built this bit yet we haven't converted

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,399
this part of the library yet

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,159
you have to do it this way or it's just

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,399
missing you know explain whatever it is

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,799
whatever the gaps are and highlight that

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,440
um explaining the benefits of why we do

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,960
it like this

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
in this in this library you know it's

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
really important because you've done

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,240
this for a reason if especially if

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,679
you're

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,520
if you know if you're trying to kind of

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,919
advocate for doing something a new way

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,200
um then you know you should have some

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,840
you should be able to explain what those

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,480
benefits are

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,640
um and you know you can kind of cover

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,320
any frequently asked questions about the

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,240
migration so if people are using you

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,120
know one fret web framework and you

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,399
built a new one you know um what are

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
their comments what questions are they

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,240
going to ask about or

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,919
how do i do this and how do i do that

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,240
cover everything you can

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,440
um and if you know in some cases it

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,159
might even be worth

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,840
showing people how to go back from you

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,960
know if they need to if they need to if

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,240
they've kind of

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,159
used your you know you've held their

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
hand to get a little bit further but

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,880
then they need to go back

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,399
then it might be worth doing that i

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,000
haven't seen that um

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:08,799
myself but it could be worth considering

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,799
um so on um this kind of concept of um

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
migration so if you've built an

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,440
abstraction on top of something maybe

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,720
you're making something easier for

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,919
people

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,320
um you know a lot of your users will be

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,320
very familiar with how the old system

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,679
worked and you've provided a nicer newer

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,679
way of doing it

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,240
um but if they hit the limits of what

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,880
you provide in the library

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,399
um then they have different you have

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,399
different options about how you can

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,080
kind of how they can move away from that

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,640
so one is

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
um go down with the ship which is just

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
give up

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,799
and you know lose all your code and have

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,080
to start again

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,159
which is obviously not what you want to

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,159
do um

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,520
another alternative is the eject seat

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,320
method which is

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,480
where you expect the they're going to

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,080
hit the edges of this thing at one point

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,919
and you can um help them escape

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,200
so you can say right i will you know

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,840
click this button i'll press this run

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
this command

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,760
and it will export everything into a way

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,360
that you can use it you know do it

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,720
in in the old way that's one one method

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,960
and um the preferable one really is

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,840
the escape patch method which is where

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,279
you say

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,919
here is the abstraction i'm kind of

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,480
hiding all the inners from you

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,919
so you know but you can still you can

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
actually open up little holes and say

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,760
well actually i want to get it that bit

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,919
but i know

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,600
it's more advanced and it's down there

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,320
and actually expose those bits to them

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,919
hide them

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,760
kind of from the you know the top level

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,559
but allow people to access them

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,679
which is a really nice way of of kind of

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,440
uplifting somebody

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,039
you know giving them giving them a

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,120
helping hand but then

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,720
not hiding stuff from them and you know

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,240
ruining their day if you end up

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,720
they end up hitting the edge and having

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,720
to give up

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,159
uh and there's a great uh blog post

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,480
about this concept that i've stolen from

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,399
uh

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,600
from my friends at anvil um i do

00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:01,039
recommend you guys a great great post

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,799
um so um open uh being open

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,320
in your discussions and being open with

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,519
your your road map is really important

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,919
so

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,200
um being open about your project goals

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,640
actually just listing things and saying

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,080
this is what this project is trying to

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,039
achieve we will you know we're working

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,960
on

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,720
implementing these features or being

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,399
able to you know to get this or

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,760
whatever the goals of the project are

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,760
actually being honest and open and

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,320
saying this is what we're trying to do

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,519
is really good um actually one of the

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,919
things i like to do is

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,360
the first thing i do on a project is

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,240
create issue number one

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,159
and write a list of features or you know

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
things that i'm trying to achieve

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
and you know you get to a point where

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,200
i'll say it will be worth

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,440
releasing as you know the 1.0 release

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,360
when all of these things are complete

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,039
um and so some of my projects they kind

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
of you know

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,760
they've got most of those things done

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
but you know there's a couple of things

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
that

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,279
i really wanted to see early on but

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,919
we've managed to kind of go on without

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,039
them but

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,519
you know they're still they're still

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,399
there um it's good to kind of document

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,840
that just have it

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,760
for prosperity's sake so

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,200
uh having a public roadmap as well which

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,679
is kind of similar to this uh but you

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
could have

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,720
it in a different format so you have a

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,200
github project board or

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,279
you know some other some other methods

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
somehow of listing what your

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,039
what your roadmap of you know actually

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,519
perhaps perhaps by dates or by release

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,960
number so by 1.6 we will have that by

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,799
1.7 we plan to do this um

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
having your discussions in public which

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,840
you know is

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
kind of easiest if you know it's more

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,679
difficult if it's just you um but

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,519
if there's say a couple of you or a

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,640
small team working on this project

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,799
actually just sharing your ideas and

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
you know um creating issues and saying

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,760
you know having a discussion about

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
what should be api like this or should

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
it do this should it do that

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,679
having those discussions allows people

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,120
to join in if necessary and then

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,559
and you know you can actually it's

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,760
almost documentation of how your

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,080
decisions got made which is

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,080
which is really useful um another

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,399
concept i really like is um what i call

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
issue driven development so

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,200
i'm actually you know a bit like what

00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
i've got here with the bullet points but

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,760
each

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,600
new thing that i think of i create an

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,200
issue it's almost as if i'm

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,799
you know writing a book saying the

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
library is missing this feature

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,679
here is what it should be and you know i

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,040
would expect to be able to run this code

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,800
and this happen

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,960
and then when you get around to fixing

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,280
it you know the issue gets closed by

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,639
by you pushing the commit so it's a nice

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,000
way of just saying you know or if

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,760
somebody else comes along and says i

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
think you should have feature x

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,639
you know if it's already in your issue

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,679
list and saying that this is missing

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,040
then you know

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,119
they can add their comment comments to

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,720
it rather than creating a new issue

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,440
because it's kind of they're aware that

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,839
it's a known uh missing feature

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,200
uh so um social media this is probably

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,760
what you thought it was the talk was

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,639
going to be about

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,359
um but it is worth mentioning so i tend

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,000
to like you know

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,720
i'm on twitter and i you know um i tweet

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,079
a lot about

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,320
open source projects and the stuff that

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,919
i do so in a way the stuff that i'm

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,800
saying about my projects is kind of like

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,320
marketing

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
um but all the stuff i've talked about

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
so far is you know helping it

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,000
be more marketable and giving me

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,119
something to talk about pointing to

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
documentation or

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,720
you know issues with you know say give

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,160
your comments to this issue that kind of

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,200
thing so i can use my own twitter

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,960
account to

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,720
um tweet and retweet things about the

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,880
project and actually

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,040
i use tweetdeck and i i have a column

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
that follows the terms gpi zero on pi

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,760
wheels that i

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,560
so with anyone whether i follow them or

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,520
not says anything about those two terms

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
um i will um i will see it and i'll you

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
know

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,560
sometimes it'd be nice to just retweet

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,079
something if somebody said something

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,880
nice or they built something interesting

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,880
with it

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,240
um but you know or if they're

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,520
complaining or if they've found a book

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,520
or something you know you can you can

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,119
have a conversation there it's good to

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,960
keep your eyes on on things um

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,800
if you're uh if you work for a company

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,599
and your open source project is related

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,400
to that company

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,800
um or another organization of some sort

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,960
um

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,240
you know tweets from them um can

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,599
actually you know can give you a lot

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
more reach so

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
uh if you know i used to work at

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,000
raspberry pi and you know if i said to

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,599
them oh could you retweet me

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,599
about this thing or could you tweet make

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,520
it you know send a tweet about this

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,359
um you know they've i've got something

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,920
like i've got nearly 10 000 followers

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,800
they've got

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,359
nearly half a million um so you know

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
there's gonna

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,280
there's gonna be a lot more reach from

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,560
um from a company like that tweeting

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,839
something getting getting the word out

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,760
there

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,960
um it might be worth considering at some

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,640
point this is obviously not a

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,240
not a big thing and certainly not early

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
on but it might be worth at some point

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,720
considering setting up an account for

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
the project

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,240
so obviously not every library and every

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,079
you know command line interface

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,280
and every every tool out there in the

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,240
world needs to have its own twitter

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,920
account but

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,000
you know sometimes you know it can be

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,079
worthwhile um

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
um and you know that there might be

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,800
something you could do like

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,320
setting up a twitter bot that tweets

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,839
stats about your project

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
or whenever you do a new release you

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,320
know it tweets for you you know some

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
there are things like that you can

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,119
explore

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,240
that's there's no kind of one formula

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,960
there's all sorts of different ways you

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,440
could use this

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,040
um so you could use all the third-party

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
services like buffer for instance you

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
could just

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,359
whenever you find um you know something

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,640
interesting you could

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,800
throw it into your buffer and buffer

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,960
will send it out at some point and

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,119
you know make make the job easier for

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
you

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,839
um so you know like i said i can't keep

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
an eye on twitter and see what you know

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,119
people are saying about my projects so

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,960
there's nice things people say about you

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,280
know things like gpo zero and pi wheels

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,640
they

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,240
you know that are worth retweeting and

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,359
they're nice things to for me to read

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
but then also

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,320
nice to share with other people this

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,760
person's got a weather station with

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,800
their project and this person's done

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,119
this

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,720
um i think my all-time favorite is the

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,640
the large one here

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,480
so guido van rossum is the creator of

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,560
python and he

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,000
unprompted tweeting tweeted saying that

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,920
he loved my library

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,200
i'm like you know it for me it doesn't

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
get better than that but you know that

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,680
was a that was a great moment for me to

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,720
to just

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,839
casually see that tweet um

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,359
but you know it's the kind of thing

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,640
that's you know that's that's really

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,000
nice to see

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,560
um and retweet um

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,680
so i created a a twitter account for my

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
pie wheels project

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,520
um purely on the basis of doing this

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,920
with it with um

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,720
so tweeting the stats like i said so

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,960
this is all automated with python on the

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,480
on the server running the system itself

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,079
um

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
and it tweets whenever it gets to a you

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,640
know i kind of thought well whenever it

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,160
gets to a new milestone in terms of the

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,760
number of downloads we served you know

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,079
if it gets to a new million

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,760
milestone just to tweet then or you know

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,359
or actually every day we could tweet a

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
graph of oh this is what the last seven

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,880
days

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,000
of data was um and that kind of thing

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,200
and it's you know it's just

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
it doesn't have a huge amount of

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,000
followers but it's just a nice thing and

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,000
every now and then if it's something

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
particularly good then i will retweet

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
that one you know there's no point me

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,880
doing it too often

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,599
um but um you know it's a nice thing to

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,440
have and

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,640
you know occasionally i'll tweet

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,560
something that's a bit more personal

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,000
from from the account and um

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,920
you know it's a nice to have it doesn't

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,920
you know isn't necessary for every

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,040
project but it's worth considering

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,440
in certain circumstances

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,280
um so having a website again like

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,960
completely optional

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,880
doesn't make sense for every project if

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,400
you've got documentation so gpr0 just

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,200
has documentation and that's all it

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
needs and there's

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,240
sufficient information throughout the

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,040
docs that um

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,359
we don't need a website uh of its own

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,079
but

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,599
um but the power wheels project because

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,599
it already is

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,880
like the project itself is is a website

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,960
in a way it's a

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,240
it needs to exist on the web anyway it

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,160
doesn't necessarily need a

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,760
human readable kind of homepage and

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,240
things but it's you know it's a night

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
you know

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,240
it's easy to throw one on um it

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
naturally fits with the

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,560
rest of the website um but you know it's

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,040
worth considering because your project

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,040
weren't

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,440
like a sort of home on the web beyond

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,240
its documentation and github and things

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,680
um and again at some point it might be

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,599
worthwhile

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,119
um and actually just having a landing

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,560
page that points to well this is whether

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,599
you download it this is where the docs

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,680
are this is the

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,720
source code this is these are the issues

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,480
this is the q a

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,160
social media community you know just

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,560
having one place where that stuff exists

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,000
is

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,560
you know quite quite nice

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,280
um and uh you know other points on on

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,319
this

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,319
are that um you know you you you

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,079
your project might fit within a sort of

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,599
series of projects maybe you or your

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,400
organization or whatever has done

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,079
so for instance the palettes project is

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,359
things like flask and ginger

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,880
and click and stuff like that and

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,000
there's a group of projects run by the

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
same people

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,040
and they just have a web page and here

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,720
is all of our documentation all the

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,240
resources for these projects um

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,920
and things like numpy and scipy and all

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,319
the scientific python libraries have

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,599
are kind of home together as well um and

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,160
if your company has

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,359
you know has an open source uh projects

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,920
page you know like

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,359
um i work for bbc they have they have an

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,720
open source page and they these are all

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,440
the things that we have open source and

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
there's a list of

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,400
projects and you can read about them and

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,079
that kind of thing so something like

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,839
that and maybe they'll give you a

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,200
a one pager on the site that just says

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,200
you know this is the home of the

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,400
of the project and link off to all the

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,400
other things and

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,119
that's nice as well um so blogging so

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
this could be

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,880
a part of your website if you've made a

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,079
website um or it could just be something

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
completely different it could be the

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
only thing it could be a thing you have

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
instead of

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,359
a whole website you just have a blog um

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,359
so

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,200
you know if you think well could you

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,200
could you write you know kind of send me

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,960
regular articles about your project

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,720
you know either there's a new release

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,440
and here's what's in it write it like a

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
bit like a

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,560
you know write it like a blog post or an

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,839
article rather than

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,720
you know just your change log um or a

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,160
few tweets

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,680
actually writing a whole article saying

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,119
you know it's it will get out there and

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
it will be in newsletters and you know

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,119
people will read it and

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,520
consume it in different ways um or could

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,280
you

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,720
you know collate or accept community

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,400
contributions to your blog if you had

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,200
one so could that you know your users

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
and people

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,319
doing interesting things with your

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,599
project could you know could they

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,680
um uh contribute to this blog

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,960
um i you know i always suggest start you

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,640
know with many things start with

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,160
something simple so just throw together

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,400
you know a bug standard like hosted

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,760
wordpress um

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,680
you know just to get you started and

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,960
that's all you need really

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
uh and if you've got if you work for a

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,079
company and they've got a blog you know

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,560
or there's a company that will use your

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,079
project

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,440
they can you know you could you could

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,880
write for their blog or they could write

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,280
about it on their blog

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,200
and promote the articles conference

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,359
talks of course um so could you give a

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,960
conference talk about your project or or

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,040
give a give a talk about

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,160
a you know a certain concept but you

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
know you're mentioning your projects

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,319
along the way as that's what you're

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,000
using to do it

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,760
and lightning talks and local user

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,200
groups are you know kind of an easy easy

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,280
way to get into that

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,720
um and you can you know promote

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,880
community members speaking of

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
giving talks about your project as well

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,640
and don't forget that the all things

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,119
open

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,319
call for papers i think opens today um

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,079
so if you're considering that that would

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,480
be a good one to do

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,839
um just to finish off we've got um so

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,920
logos

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,440
um so there are a bunch of really nice

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,079
logos that you can identify

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,000
open source projects with um so as i

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,359
said it's it's not it's not mandatory at

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,839
all and it's um

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,599
um but it might be at some point makes

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,839
sense for you to have a logo

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
um so could you design something simple

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,400
that's one option

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,400
um something simple like just a word

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,960
logo with um

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
some simple shapes and you know um

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,839
chosen colors

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,760
could be enough to have you know have

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,480
something you can use as a logo

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,760
um might be worth considering um you

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,359
could do a call for

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,119
for contributions or create an issue so

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,000
we'd like to we'd like a logo and

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,000
either ask for somebody to do it um to

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,160
contribute to the project or you could

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,359
even consider finding a designer who'd

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,640
be willing to do it for money

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,720
and then finding out how much it would

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,040
cost and raising the money you know and

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,720
asking uh you know asking for the

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,960
contributions towards the cost that kind

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,440
of thing

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,160
um to to get the word out about your

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,359
project there's

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,400
various things you can do to kind of

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,520
hitch a lift so um

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,359
you know if you can if there's a

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,680
relevant email newsletter if it's like a

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,000
pi

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,440
pi coders weekly is a python newsletter

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,240
you could ask them like can you feature

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,520
my library

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,200
in the project um and one of my friends

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,960
at anvil i mentioned earlier they tend

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,280
to do a lot which is really cool is

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,640
they'll build projects using some api or

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,319
some other product

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,079
and write a blog post an article and

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,000
tutorial things about it

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,079
and tweet about it and it gives the

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,480
other company the incentive to retweet

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
or

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,079
talk about you know what you know what

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
this company has done with their

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,359
product so there's kind of ways you can

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
kind of um

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,040
blag a retweet out of it that kind of

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,040
thing

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,720
um and there's just to finish up there's

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,839
there's lots of different resources and

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,319
different ways people

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,920
can learn things um so there's you know

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,720
