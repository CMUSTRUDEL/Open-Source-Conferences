Jennifer Wadella, Director of Angular Development at Bitovi, delivered a keynote talk at Open Source 101 on Tuesday, March 30, 2021. 

Talk Title: 10 Commandments of Community Organizing (shortened, keynote version)

Abstract:
Welcome to the advanced class on community organizing. You’ve got a decent amount of members in your Meetup.com group, you hold events fairly routinely, maybe you’ve pulled in some legit speakers at your last conference or event … and you want to do more. This talk will focus on community organizing for growth and longevity by building out teams, improving communications, implementing processes, and most importantly will discuss how to maintain sanity in your work-life-volunteer balance. If you’ve ever had to answer the question “Oh, this ISN’T your full-time job???” – this talk is definitely for you. If you’re just starting out organizing and don’t want to fall flat on your face, this talk will be very pragmatic for you.

thanks for having me

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,360
um as i like frantically look for the

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,120
zoom share screen button i

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,040
if anybody is looking for an open source

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,519
idea i'm going to drop this one on you

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
to create a game that like um rotates

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
through all the different

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,439
uh communication interfaces and whoever

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,119
gets the share

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,720
screen button first like they win that

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,920
round so you can like do with zoom and

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
google hangouts and

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,599
web apps and all sorts of stuff so

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
that's a free one on you if you're

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
looking uh for some fun fun project to

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,120
work on

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
but today i'm going to be talking about

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
uh as todd mentioned the 10 commandments

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,320
of community organizing

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
i may have told paid him to say all

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
those nice things about me

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
um but as you mentioned i'm the director

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
of angular development of batavi bhitovi

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
i'm a non-profit founder i'm an

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
international speaker

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,920
and courtesy of the uh pandemic i've

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
become a pretty crazy plant lady

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
and that's a lot of different hats to

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
wear and i feel like a lot of open

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
source maintainers or community

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,320
organizers have definitely felt the pain

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
i felt if they've ever

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
like been questioned about their project

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
and um

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
heard oh this isn't your full-time job

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
like mind's blown right

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
um and so kind of the theme of this talk

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
is uh creating some rules or some

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
guidelines or honestly just like a

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
safety harness for anybody setting out

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
to

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,479
um run a community um do something in

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
the open source world some kind of like

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,439
rules or commandments that i've learned

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
over the years

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
that i want to impart on y'all today

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
this is a super condensed talk so i'm

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,000
just going to give you the high outline

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
um if you're interested or you're like

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
oh my gosh this is so me jennifer like

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
this is

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,680
exactly the kind of thing i deal with on

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
a daily basis

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
i'm going to be doing a longer version

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
of this talk where i not only share some

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
more in-depth strategies but i share

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
some horror stories so you will know

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,600
you were not the only one who's had

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
these kind of experiences running a

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
community

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
all right um so a little bit about my

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
background in the community space

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
i like so many minorities in tech uh

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
kind of got into the industry was really

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,119
really excited looked around the room

00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
and was like wait nobody looks like me

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,600
here

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
and so that led me to found i think

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
about eight years ago now kansas city

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,159
women in technology a nonprofit with the

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
goal of

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
getting more women into the tech

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,640
community in kansas city

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
and uh you know things never turn out

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
the way you expect i learned a lot of

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
lessons along the way

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
um and as i began to hear the needs of

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
the community and everything like that

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,760
uh it led to the launching of a lot of

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
different programs um one of the first

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
initiatives we took on was launching a

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
local chapter of coder dojo uh coder

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
dojo is actually a global

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
nonprofit uh that has made it really

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
easy to bootstrap and start up a coding

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
club to teach kids how to code

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
um so we recruited mentors in from all

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
over the city it just exploded in

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,840
popularity

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
um to the point that we would actually

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
um you know have

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,319
have trouble or have to wait list i got

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
that popular

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,760
and then a lot of our programs led from

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,760
there we started coding in cupcakes

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
which is specifically targeting girls

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
getting them engaged and excited and

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
coding

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
um and then when that of course exploded

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
in popularity we would get a lot of

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
emails from

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,599
women being like hey uh you know i'm not

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,959
i don't have a daughter but can i come

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,319
to your coding classes anyway and so

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
that led to the birth of coding and

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,519
cocktails which is one of our more

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
popular series for teaching women how to

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,239
code

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
and then of course as much as we could

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
we took every opportunity

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
um to partner with already existing

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
organizations um you may have

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
heard of django girls or you know pie

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
ladies or view vixens or all sorts of

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
these different organizations so we did

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,200
our best to kind of partner with them

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
um and you know be able to

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
bootstrap what they've done and bring

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
those things to our community so it's a

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
little bit of my background and where

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,680
some of these

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
commandments came from uh so

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
when we talk about why communities

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
matter like all the talks we've seen so

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
far are so brilliant and

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
have so struck um into my heart of you

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
know

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,720
valuing people and value valuing this

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
this volunteer work that we do

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,760
and community communities matter and do

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,159
so much good for us

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,439
um they are really our best workforce

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
development right now

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,680
um universities can't keep up boot camps

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
can't keep up with the way that we're

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,720
progressing as the software industry so

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
this is one of the best ways that we

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,360
have to educate

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
and build our workforce and these are

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,239
largely run by volunteers by communities

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
these give us opportunities to network

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,640
um this has been

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,239
monumental especially for

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,519
underrepresented minorities to get a

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,199
better understanding of

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
of how the tech community works talking

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
about pay talking about equal salary

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
that kind of thing

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,919
um this is a way to get growth

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
opportunities to find what's out there

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
beyond

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
your company or your little isolated box

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,240
that you're working in

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
um and honestly like this gets

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
psychological um this helps us to happen

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
to my

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,320
maslow's hierarchy that love and

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
belonging or self-actualization that we

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
need to feel good as human beings

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
um by joining communities by being able

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
to be around people who

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
understand what we do and share our

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,080
interests and our passions and our

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
failures and our triumphs

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,880
that's very fulfilling for us as human

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
beings on you know a psychological level

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,479
and in the fact of this is community

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,840
organizers are unsung heroes

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,440
i'm assuming a lot of y'all at this

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
conference um have your hands into

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
something whether you're a part of a

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,919
community

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
whether you're leading a community and a

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,560
lot of people just have no idea how much

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,560
work goes

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,400
into what we do to create these amazing

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,479
events to create amazing conferences to

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
create amazing open source projects

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
um so this content is for y'all i i want

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
to help you learn from

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
some of the mistakes i've made over the

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
years and and have a guideline from

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
walking forward

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,080
um so why ten commandments uh i was i

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
was very

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
catholic um so if you're not of the

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
catholic or

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
christian religion basically uh these

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,400
were rules uh given to

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
a biblical figure by their god to say

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
hey this is how your people should live

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
and i remember one time in a slack

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,880
conversation i was talking to another

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
community organizer who had just had

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
some

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
disaster happen and i said something

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,800
along the lines of thou

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
shall confirm that i venue thrice and so

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
it kind of became this running joke and

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
i'm like damn like this would make a

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
really good

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
talk idea to kind of give people

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
guidelines of things that they can do

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,120
um to capture some of the learnings

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
we've all made as community organizers

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
and help run better events and build

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,479
better communities

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
all right so right into our ten

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,600
commandments

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,039
thou shall practice self-care um and

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
this is commandment number one this is

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,319
the most important one

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
because you as a volunteer this probably

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,759
is not your full-time job right so your

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
time is your biggest asset

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
your priority needs to be guarding your

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
time and using your time

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
in the most effective way possible to

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,759
push your project forward

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
um so key here is to definitely avoid

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,479
burnout

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
um you want to implement task management

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
strategies and office hours and again if

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
you join me a little later on i'll kind

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
of share some of my tips and tricks for

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
managing um these kind of things

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,039
um but a big thing is learning to field

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
criticism you know you may not be

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,840
operating at full capacity because

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
you're wearing so many different hats

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
but the people criticizing you don't

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
have context into your world or your

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
project so learning to feel that

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
criticism

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
and be able to extract the pieces of

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
information you can execute on versus

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
when somebody's just there to complain

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
is one of the best things you can do to

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
kind of manage self-care protect

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
yourself and

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
continue to be a better organizer along

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
those lines i would advocate for you to

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,720
build your support system find other

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,160
people running communities find other

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
people who share your struggles

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
to be able to get their ideas and bounce

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,440
things off them

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
and learn to delegate uh one of the

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
trickiest things in anything be it open

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
source software be it in a company be it

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,280
in a community is learning how to scale

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,520
and delegation is a key key part of that

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
um i want to drop one little note on you

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
uh this is what i call jennifer's first

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
law

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,639
anybody who's been involved with my

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,080
nonprofit who's been on my leadership

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
team is familiar with this

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,599
and that is a person's incompetence and

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
email is directly proportional to the

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
likelihood that they will massively

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,080
waste your time

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
um when you start leading a community

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,199
you start leading a project you are the

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
face of it you become this focal point

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,000
this

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
lightning rod for literally everything

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,960
um and so sometimes it takes a little

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
while to adjust and to be able to

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,319
discern what's valid content what's just

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
going to be in complete utter waste of

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,039
your time

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,199
um so i'd encourage you to prioritize

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,919
your time and be really really smart

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
and work smarter not harder all right

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
commitment number two

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,800
thou shall become an expert communicator

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
uh and this is really really key um

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
this has been touched on a lot already

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
and the importance of documentation in

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,840
open source projects but the key here

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
is um never assume people are as in

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
tuned to your organization as you are

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
your project is your baby it's your life

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
right

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,080
and so you have this very narrow tunnel

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
vision and not everybody has

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
insight into what you're thinking about

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
um so this means what you're going to

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
need to do is you're going to need to be

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
aware of that

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,039
and adapt your communication to your

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,199
audience is slack an appropriate format

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,199
for conveying information is it email is

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
it updating the readme page or

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
you know building out a wiki inside of

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,080
github um just be aware of that

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,760
and make sure that you're adapting your

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,880
communication style to benefit your

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
audience

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
and when in doubt over communicate if

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
you're running something you're managing

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
something you've got that 20 000 foot

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
view where you understand everything

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,080
that's going on

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,160
and people may not have that view or

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
those pieces um so the more you can

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
communicate explain the why explain the

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
road map um

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,600
explain how things are happening the

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,240
more successful you're going to be

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,760
all right number three that shall manage

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,760
expectations

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,440
and this is really great life advice

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
period but it'll prevent you a lot of

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
heartache in in open source projects or

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,959
in community management

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
so managing expectations equals happier

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,920
community and fewer complaints in the

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
open source community if you're seeing a

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
lot of repeat issues or something like

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
that

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,320
um if you can manage expectations around

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
your team's capacity and your ability to

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
address those issues

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
that is really key people have a better

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
understanding of how you're able to

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
operate

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
and then you're not going to have to

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,279
filter through as much noise all the

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
time

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,399
it's also really important to set

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
boundaries as i mentioned before some of

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
you might have gotten that question of

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
oh this isn't your full-time job

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
so you're going to need to get

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,399
comfortable politely reminding people

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
politely setting those boundaries of hey

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
this is what i am actually capable of

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,279
right now

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
and in those lines of managing

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,519
expectations know your value system

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,880
i'm going to tell you straight up that

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,480
there are organizations that my

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
nonprofit has partnered with before and

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
when we didn't feel like they were

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,000
emulating our values as intersectional

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
feminists or being aware

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
of problems that non-white women face

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,440
inside of like an already

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
underrepresented community we walked

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
away from those organizations and that

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
was a part of our value system

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
and it's something to manage

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
expectations and maintain these are our

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
values this is how we will operate

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,480
and along those lines it's really great

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
to own your code of conduct

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
and it's not just enough to write a code

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
of conduct or adopt something a lot of

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
those are open source

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,360
but have a process that people know how

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
to report incidents how incentives are

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,160
going to be handled what does that

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
pipeline look like

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,040
and so that'll go a long way with

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,880
helping you manage expectations with how

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,880
your project will run

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
all right number four thou shall not

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,079
neglect thy volunteers

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,760
uh volunteers are our community

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
lifeblood like we're unpaid y'all we're

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,480
doing this out of the goodness of our

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,920
heart because we want to learn because

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
we understand the importance of building

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
community

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,120
and sometimes it's easy as organizers or

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
project facilitators to kind of forget

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
about that

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
so a couple things to keep in mind with

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
your volunteers make things easy for

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
volunteers to contribute whether this is

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
you know great documentation or

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
onboarding to how to open a pull request

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
or whether this is just

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,720
when and where to show up on time and

00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
what tasks and responsibilities are

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
going to be

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,279
the more work you can put into

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
streamlining things for volunteers the

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,519
greater their output is going to be

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
find ways to think your volunteers this

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,880
could be shout outs on social media this

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
could be like you know nice swag or

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
stickers or all sorts of fun things but

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,720
make sure that you're

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
prioritizing ways to say thank you

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,480
one of the best ways that you can grow

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
is to solicit volunteer feedback

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
and act on it not anything may be

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
actionable right away but one of the key

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
things you can do is

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,399
get feedback from volunteers on how to

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
improve because they're going to be

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,240
looking at projects from a different

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,720
lens than you are

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
all right commandment number five thou

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
shall plan

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
as far in advance as caligula possible

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
and i know this is really really

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
hard but if you're trying to line up

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
speakers like our schedules are crazy

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,959
maybe a little less crazy and pandemic

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,399
times um because you know it's just

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,839
another zoom all right i guess i will

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,639
leave my office chair for another eight

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,240
hours

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,600
um but the more planning and the more

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
events you can get on the calendar

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
further out the more success you're

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
gonna have with turnout with attendees

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
and with speakers

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
um and seriously if you ever email a

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
speaker like 24 hours in advance because

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
you need to fill a hole in the panel and

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
especially if you're trying to fill a

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,040
token hole in a panel just don't there's

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,320
nothing that's going to enrage us more

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,920
than doing something like this so the

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
more for that you can put into your

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
events in your calendar

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
the better you will be even if you don't

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
have anything lined up get it on the

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
calendar

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,560
start planning towards it and that'll

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,959
help you out a lot

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
all right um next commandment the one i

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,800
i referenced earlier

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,560
thou shalt confirm the venue thrice um

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,320
this kind of goes back a little bit to

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,680
your tunnel vision like your event is

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
very high priority you're

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,480
you know planning on it but the

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
different people you may be working with

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,720
be it vendors be it venues or anything

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
like that

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
have a million other things on their

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,079
plate um so one of the best things you

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
can do is you know set up a confirmation

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,200
pattern um when we were consistently

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,639
running events pre-covered time

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,880
we would confirm the month before we

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
would confirm the week of and then we

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,959
would

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
confirm just two days before because i

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
have walked up and been locked out of a

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,800
building we were supposed to have a

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,360
coding and cupcakes class

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
and i looked like a jackass so this is

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
something that i would encourage you to

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,760
do as an organizer just to make sure

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,040
that you're covered

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,880
um and in having a game plan um

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
along those lines another commandment we

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
have discovered is thou shalt arrive at

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
least one hour before starting time

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,639
um the kind of golden rule here is your

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,519
attendees will be early your speakers

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
will be late

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
um so an hour is a really good buffer

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,880
time and even for like a zoom situation

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
where you're just doing tech checks or

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,519
anything like that

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,959
um this hour gives you a really nice

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
buffer so you're not running around

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
looking like a hot mess um for

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,560
any of the things that could possibly go

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
wrong

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,720
that shall test the wi-fi and bring any

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
supplies needed um again this is a

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
little different in our pandemic era but

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
it's a good idea to do

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,639
you know tech checks and all sorts of

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,279
things but when we're back and in person

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,279
again

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,120
um having wi-fi if you're having a tech

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
related event is one of the fastest ways

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
to tech your event and it's so hard to

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,199
recover from

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,800
um technically it's uh it's social

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
etiquette for speakers to be on top of

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
bringing their

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,680
their dongles any supplies that they may

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,399
need but a good thing you can do as an

00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
organizer

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,160
is to make sure that you have all the

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,160
supplies you know the wi-fi or you have

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
contact information for the person who

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,880
has

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,560
wi-fi or router access to be able to

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,079
trouble shoot on the fly if something

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,639
happens

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,320
um so all sorts of ways that you can

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,680
basically be aware of what's going on

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
kind of make sure that you're

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
you're you're covering your ass and your

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,360
events will go a lot smoother

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
uh one of the other tips that we've

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,199
adopted over the year is that shout have

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
a designated chaos lead

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
because even with that hour window

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,480
you're giving yourself to

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,959
prepare so many things can go wrong i

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
will forever be scarred of a story from

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,839
a django girls event i can't remember i

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
think they might have been in new york

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
city

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
where they were using a business over

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,839
the weekend you know some sort of

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
developer shop and they walk in

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,560
and the business had told the janitorial

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,160
staff well there's going to be an event

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
over the weekend so the janitorial staff

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
wasn't planning on coming until after

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,600
so they have an event i don't know like

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
50 60 80 women

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
and they walk into the bathrooms and

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
there's no toilet paper and it's like

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
you as a technical event organizer why

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
would the thought ever cross your brain

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
to make sure that your venue has toilet

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
paper

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,839
um but these are the kind of random

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
things you absolutely cannot plan for

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
and so having a designated chaos lead

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,440
having a person who is not the person in

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,199
charge is really really key

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
like you see todd doing a great great

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,600
job emceeing and being prepared and

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
everything like that

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
he can't both lead this event and be

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
running around solving every crisis so

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,880
having a chaos lead is key

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,040
um if you've never heard of murphy's law

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
that law is what can go wrong will go

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,279
wrong

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
um and you know i've been running

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,240
community events for eight years now

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
and this holds true every time just the

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
most

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
unexpected disasters you cannot plan for

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,560
you know come up and go wrong you can be

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,839
up twerking against the door and your

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
roommate comes home and your pants catch

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,880
on fire like

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,279
murphy's law always prevails

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,440
all right and our final commandment is

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,800
thou shall focus on process improvement

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
wherever possible

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,720
um again this goes back to this idea

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
that this is not our full-time job this

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
is not something that you know we are

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,720
able to dedicate 100 of our energy to

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,839
as you know community organizers as open

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
source maintainers

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
um so one of the best things we can do

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
is focus on process improvement wherever

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
we can in small little bits

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
so whether you notice an onboarding

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
snafu and that's something you can get

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,759
updated in your documentation or your

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
readme or you notice that check-in is

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
always really stressful when everybody's

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
arriving at the same time

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,320
what can you do to optimize those

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
processes um you know kind of taking it

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,519
on like we would take on software

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
development finding small tasks like

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
breaking them out into something that's

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
really really manageable is a great way

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
for your

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
organization to be able to iterate and

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,240
move quickly um retrospectives are a

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,160
great way to

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
handle this and capture information from

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
your volunteers from other people who

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,759
are seeing

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
things from from different views than

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,959
you might have

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,480
all right so in summary uh as your

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
ten commandments that shall practice

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
self-care commitment number one this is

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,519
your most important

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
that shall become an expert communicator

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
understand your audience and figure out

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
what is the best way to convey

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
information to them

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
and that shall manage expectations those

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
are your top three that are going to get

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
you past the most heartache

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,079
that you can have as a new organizer or

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,600
even more of an experienced organizer um

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,360
and then thou shall not neglect thy

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,199
volunteers thou shalt plan as far in

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,039
advance as calvin literally possible

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,039
thou shall confirm the venue price cover

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
your ass thou shall arrive

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,160
one hour before starting time test the

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,000
wi-fi

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
uh have a designated chaos lead and

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,880
focus on process improvement

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
wherever possible um i did want to leave

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
you with some resources i will link

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,640
these slides in the chat afterwards and

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
they're also available

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,160
on the next slide um but i do have a

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
blog series where i talk about building

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
volunteer teams and how to run great

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
events

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
um one of the things that i did not have

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,120
a chance to touch on this in depth in

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
this talk is the idea of creating

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,720
inclusive events

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
and understanding how to account for

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,679
experiences that may not match your own

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
that you may not even be aware of so

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,320
there's a great article here eight areas

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
to work on if you want to create

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,640
inclusive events which i hope you all do

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,799
and the missing stare which is an

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
article that just talks about the way

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
we have historically dealt with bad

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,600
actors in our communities

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,120
and how detrimental they can be um so

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,480
this is the slide to take a picture of

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
uh the slides are available at 10

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,400
commandments.jenniferwadella.com

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
uh if you have any questions i think
