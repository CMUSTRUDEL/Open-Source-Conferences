Description: 
	Henry Zhu, Open Source Maintainer of Babel, delivered the talk "Open (Source of Fear)" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Hopefully, the talk title isn’t too scary to attend! But I’d like to talk about some of the fears one faces when starting and continuing to do open source, as sometimes they don’t go away. Not all are unique to open source, but some stories and suggestions on coping with them.
