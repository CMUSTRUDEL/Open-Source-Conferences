Description: 
	Henry Zhu, Open Source Maintainer of Babel, delivered the talk "Open (Source of Fear)" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Hopefully, the talk title isn’t too scary to attend! But I’d like to talk about some of the fears one faces when starting and continuing to do open source, as sometimes they don’t go away. Not all are unique to open source, but some stories and suggestions on coping with them.

thanks

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,480
everyone for coming to this talk um

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
yeah it might be a little scattered and

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
i know that this

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
talk is not the easiest thing to talk

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,800
about but i think given

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
um getting into open source is kind of a

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,880
difficult thing i

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,560
wanted to share a little bit of maybe

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
some things i've been thinking about in

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,599
terms of

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,599
different fears that you might have

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
coming into open source and then just

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,680
fears i have even as someone that has

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,280
been doing open source for a while

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,120
uh now um and so i guess a bit of

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,840
background as i work on the battle

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,280
project

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,399
i've been doing it for a few years now

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,039
and so yeah let me get through okay so

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,520
when you're you know first starting off

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
in

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,719
i guess anything but in open source

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
specifically you might have a lot of

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,199
these

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,320
initial questions of which project you

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
should work on what

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
should i work on what if the things i do

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
um

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,720
don't help the project and i think these

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
are all valid

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
um questions that i don't really have

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
like an easy

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,280
answering necessarily um i mean and

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
i think that especially like say you

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,600
know which project um i think

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,680
usually we would say you should work on

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,200
something that you have familiarity with

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
you have contacts with you know you

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,240
maybe use it in your

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
work or something that you're interested

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,799
in instead of

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
simply going to the github page and

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,799
looking at the issues to try to figure

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
out

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
what's going on on your own but yeah

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
these are all

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
things that i think we could do better

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,240
at um trying to guide people through

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,159
uh but one thing i think about is making

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
this metaphor of seeing that

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,360
github projects are kind of you know

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
their own communities and i think a lot

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
of people have been talking about this

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
today um and i like to think of it sort

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
of like

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,040
that each project each repo is

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
you know it has different scales so like

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
this example i just

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,160
took a screenshot like a random project

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
i had you know has zero stars um

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
no one's it hasn't been active for a

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
long time uh maybe this is more of like

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,599
a garden where

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,280
there's you know one person that cares

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
about this thing and maybe it would be

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,239
nice if

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
um other people think it's helpful as

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
well

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
maybe you know if it's babel it's more

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,200
like a town

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
um maybe if you work on something like

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
node or

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,239
linux it maybe it acts more like a city

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
and i think that

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,760
i've had people ask about like what kind

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
of etiquette you should have on open

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
source

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,760
and i think it's important to realize

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
that

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
you know github is a singular interface

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
you

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
it's hard to remember and realize that

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
each

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
repo or project has its own norms on how

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
they do their work you know do they use

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
pull requests do they have issues

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,959
sometimes they they don't do the same

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
things as everyone else even though

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
on the you know in the ui everything

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
looks the same

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,959
and so there's i think there can be a

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
problem with communication between the

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
project and new contributors because

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
it's hard to know like what to do next

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
other than saying things like

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,959
look at the contributing.md guide or

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
maybe we have a website that tells you

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
what to do

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159
you know if you think about going to

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
like maybe a foreign country or a city

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
a lot of times you might you know look

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
at a guide or just look at youtube to

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
find out what it's like you

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,080
you understand that people have certain

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,360
ways of interacting with each other

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
um and i think everyone tries to be or

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
it's good to know that you're going in a

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
different place and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
it's not the same as what you're used to

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
i don't think we do that much in open

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
source and i think

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
maybe that's a lot to do with the fact

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
that it's all on github and it all looks

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,920
the same

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
the only way we interact is through

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
these issues

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
and a lot of times you never get to see

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
people face to face

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,879
um so something i think about as a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
maintainer is like how we can

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,400
change that you know within our own

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,040
project but then overall

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
i think it'd be great to kind of change

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
that

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,560
to help people feel more at ease as

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,400
where they're at and stuff

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
i think that another fear is uh what

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
your first contribution should be and

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
maybe you feel like

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
uh it has to be this huge thing that

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,199
changes the project

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
or or something like that and i think a

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,960
lot of people maybe say this that um

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,040
you know i think one thing you can do is

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,880
go to this site called

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
first pull request you can look up

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,919
anyone's username

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,560
for mine it looks like mine was

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,600
nine years ago and it wasn't merged i

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
looked at

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
what i did i think i didn't know how to

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,440
use git

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
at the time so i ended up adding all

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
these other commits from other people

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
and ended up being closed

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
um so you know i guess i just just to

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
say that

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
um people that seem like they're really

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
experienced or successful

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,199
uh yeah we all started out from the same

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,400
place not understanding what to do

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
um and i think it would be helpful for

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
the good first issues to kind of

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,919
differentiate between

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600
what's i guess you know when we say a

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
good first issue it's like kind of hard

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
to know like is it

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
good because no this person has never

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,320
used github before

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
and they're still like in this case for

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,960
me i was still trying to figure out how

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
to use the

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,520
the git itself or is it the project

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
uh maybe trying to fix a doc a bug fix

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,160
or a documentation change

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
um yeah knowing that oh they have

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,440
experience with git

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
and github but maybe not this specific

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
project like we can give them a

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
different

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,560
sense of what that is um my first

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
contribution to a project i that i

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
eventually became the maintainer of

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
um was just adding a table of contents

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
um

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,600
and it was really great to see the

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,160
current

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
or that maintainer at the time was

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
really helpful

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,120
in just saying thanks um if you see

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,880
here that it says um i i made this

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
chrome extension that tells you

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
the amount of pr's that people make to a

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
repo when they submit

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,039
a pull request and so here it says first

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
pr out of 124 and this is because i made

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,919
that many

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
eventually but i think this can be

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,680
helpful as a maintainer to know that oh

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,720
the person here that's replying it's

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
their first time

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,280
responding in this project or this

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,199
organization or even on github entirely

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
uh we should change how we interact with

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,080
them um and i guess even if you're new

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
it

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,840
i think it might be really hard to um

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
say that you're new but i think that's

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
like it'll bring a lot of context to the

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,919
person

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
kind of trying to respond because they

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,560
maybe are too busy or just don't know

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,680
um what experience level you have in the

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
project or with open source in general

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,840
um

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,160
but and it's funny because um

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,599
thinking about how long your

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,639
contribution will last

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,560
um you know this uh

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
ceo of github he just tweeted that

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
github now has this

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
automatic table of contents button you

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
can click on

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,400
to to get that and so the other thing i

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
i made from

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
those years ago uh we don't even need it

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
anymore

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,240
and so it's okay that the changes that

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
you make might get replaced um

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
eventually right not everything we do is

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
going to last forever and i guess maybe

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
in

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
some sense maybe it's a bad thing if it

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
lasts forever

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
in terms of depending on what it is um

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,039
that

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,560
it's okay if um these changes are

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,479
temporary or

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,319
need um future changes i think that

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
um and also yeah if you have any

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,960
questions feel free to ask during this i

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
think i

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,880
will probably end the talk earlier just

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
so um people can have a chance to ask

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
specific

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
things because i'm not sure exactly what

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,639
everyone's fears are um

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,840
i yeah and i guess related to this is

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
just that

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,039
um yeah we don't i think as a maintainer

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,879
or as a as a new contributor you might

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,960
think that

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
everything that needs to be done is

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
already being taken care of by the

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,720
maintainer

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,479
it's kind of funny that on the

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,360
maintainer side you might feel like

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,039
there's so many things to do and it's

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
hard to kind of get all those things out

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
of your head

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
so that people can try to do them and on

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,160
the other side if you're new

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
you think that everything's under

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,599
control that you don't we don't

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,280
no one needs your help or that you

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
the skills that you have aren't helpful

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
for the project

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
when in reality it's kind of like how do

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
we match these two together and that's

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,479
all that's really hard

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,000
um i think another advice that i would

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,360
give in terms of

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
being not sure what to do is trying to

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
embrace

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
things that are what seem like useless

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
or or weird uh one example i just

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
thought of was uh christina this is a

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,399
while ago

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
she just thought as like a joke to make

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
a

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,080
formatter you know we had this program

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
called prettier which makes her pretty

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
her code

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
formatted like automatically and she was

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
thinking why don't we make a different

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
one called pettier

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
which just tells you that you should do

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
uh

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
leaves comments and tells you what to do

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
um and it's a funny joke that you know

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
got a lot of uh

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,640
traction but then later she was like oh

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
why don't i just learn

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,560
how to maybe actually implement this

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,640
because then it'll help her learn

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
how this thing works in the first place

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
and she used babel to kind of

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
figure out how to manipulate the code

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,720
and then maybe

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,160
by open sourcing that learning other

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
people can understand

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
how these tools work and work in the

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
first place and that's definitely an

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
amazing contribution because it brings

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
more people into this general space not

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
just

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
working on the serious things because

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
these fun things

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,800
lead to people um exploring and actually

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,040
getting

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,920
in-depth knowledge into how these things

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,880
work

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,080
one example that uh happened recently is

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,360
my friend omar

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,760
he made a similar prettier thing i'm not

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
sure if this video will play but

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
you know it takes any piece of text and

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,200
it will format it

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,200
in a certain way and so in this

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,279
scenario i i took that i was like oh

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,800
what if i could change that as well

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,320
so i made a version where it takes

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,680
i guess babel input or code that was

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
that you would run through about like in

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,279
this case uh jsx from react

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,120
and then it'll morph into what babel

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,079
turns it into which is uh

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
all these uh function calls um and then

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
i think that's a great way of

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
visualizing uh what's going on in that

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,399
tool and help me

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
this visual way of seeing things might

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
inspire people to want to contribute to

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,360
ballot more than just saying like oh

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,640
let's try to make it faster

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,640
or all this technical stuff

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,600
and then later i got inspired to even

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,200
take this approach and take a piece of

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
code and

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,360
uh play music over it and then based on

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,279
where your mouse moves it will

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
move the code and you know this is

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
completely useless

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
but you know because of this i learned

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,920
how to uh

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
you know take the audio from my computer

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,800
like learning different apis

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
maybe this kind of fun little thing

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,440
might get people to wonder how this

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
works and then if i

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,279
put the code out there they'll learn it

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
maybe it might get more contributors

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
um so i think we can think outside the

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,440
box in terms of how

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
to approach um what open source is

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
supposed to be i think this is supposed

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
to be is a

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,440
is a just leads to a lot of i guess

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
guilt um one example i think of in terms

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
of

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
i guess what we think are useless things

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
that end up being really helpful is like

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,560
say origami

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,240
origami is tends to be you think of it

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
as something people do for fun it's like

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
an art

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
thing maybe it makes it's like peaceful

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,480
to do it and you fold paper but

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,120
um you know we use these ideas from

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,399
origami

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,920
in like say when we try to create um

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
things that we send into space like the

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,120
solar panels that are able to fold up

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
and then take up less space when we're

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,079
sending it out to space but then when

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,440
they fold out they have more surface

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,880
area

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
and so i think like it's i would really

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,639
encourage

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,800
people to be cross-disciplinary

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
um to take things that they're

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
interested in their hobbies you know

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
whether

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
you know a lot of people don't um didn't

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,560
graduate from a school or maybe a boot

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
camp or you're going to boot camp and

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,120
you used to do something else like my

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
old um co-worker was a musician you know

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
like

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
all these different people that take all

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,360
these experiences outside of tech into

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
tech or tech into other things

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,800
i think is amazing and i think if we're

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,480
really going to change some of the

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
problems that we've had it's because we

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
keep

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
doing the same solutions and just doing

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,839
more of the same rather than taking like

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,079
new ideas and incorporating together

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,360
even though from the outset everyone

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,760
might think that that was like a

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,639
horrible idea you don't know and i think

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,519
being okay with failure and being okay

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,720
with

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,440
um just like going with what your gut

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
has is like freeing and also like fun i

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,000
think

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,800
yeah i know that sort of uh maybe like a

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
rant on that but

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
i think that's super important and yeah

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,680
i guess this is kind of the point

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,519
is i want me like even especially me is

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,920
to reinstill the sense of play

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,519
and excitement that i have i think doing

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
anything for a long time you get kind of

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
jaded just because

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
you're doing things that other people

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
want you're you're focused on like

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,760
especially in our industry it's about

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
like speed

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,760
and you know correctness and all that

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,120
and these are all valid and important

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
things but there are other

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
values that are also important that i

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
think can

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
they kind of shape each other um they

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
help each other out you know why why do

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
people like legos

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,560
minecraft um there's two people that

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,320
learn programming through minecraft

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,839
because they have their own version of

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
you know i guess electricity redstone um

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,360
and i think

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,959
being able to do this in our industry in

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,920
open source even right it seems such

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,199
like a technical

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,560
boring or um or serious thing i think

00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,880
how do we kind of combine these two

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
things

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
i think would be great to change our

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,600
culture

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
um yeah and this is a little bit

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,399
different

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,519
but i think a lot of the guilt that you

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
have in open source this is

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,040
once you i guess i guess you're over

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
your fear

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,680
of your first contribution you end up

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,959
becoming a maintainer so like for me

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,959
um i kind of accidentally turned

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,519
became a maintainer of battle i i kind

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,399
of made my first contributions

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,839
um eventually just like you know you

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,040
have this progression of things that you

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,360
do like you make your

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,639
doc fix and then your bug fix and then

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
make a feature

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,040
and then then you're like oh wait maybe

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,480
uh someone gives you responsibility

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
they're like oh now you can merge things

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
and you're afraid to do it

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
and so uh and eventually you're the

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,199
maintainer now and you're like

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
you realize like oh i guess i've been

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,360
given all this responsibility

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,040
and now you maybe feel guilty so before

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
you're trying so hard to like get all

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,839
these you know commits in and make your

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
you know like the number go up right and

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,480
eventually

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,720
you wonder well um i'm afraid of making

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,639
those mistakes

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
you spend a lot of time trying to fix

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
other people's problems

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,120
which is a valid and awesome thing to do

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,040
but it's hard to kind of put boundaries

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
on how much time you're spending

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,399
and i guess that's not that different in

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,480
your own job or

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
feeling like every second of your life

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,720
needs to be you know productive

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,399
i think definitely so in open source

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
right you don't feel like you can

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
have weekends or take vacation because

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
um

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,040
you're available you're making yourself

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,759
available so often through

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,160
github or twitter or slack or giving

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,240
talks or whatever it is

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,560
and i think it's so easy to kind of in

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,600
the beginning you're trying so hard to

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
um you know continue to do more like do

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
more open source which is great

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
but eventually you know it's hard to

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,720
remember to kind of take a step back

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,600
or uh you know push the brakes

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,880
i think that this is interesting law

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
goodhart's law

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,720
when a measure becomes a target it seems

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,320
to be a good measure um

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
it seems to be true in a lot of places

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
like you know with google

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
with like knowing that you know you can

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
increase your search

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,560
uh we we have spam and seo to get people

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
to click on certain things or yeah

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
clickbait i guess and even in the

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
academic sense um the number of

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,680
citations

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
is like a measure of how amazing you are

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
as a academic so then that becomes

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,959
something that people try to do and then

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
maybe that's not useful

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,040
when you realize that you want to add

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
tests maybe you think that oh i need to

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
cover

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,720
every part of my code so that there's no

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,519
possible chance of it having a bug

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,959
um and i think this is true in open

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
source i mean if you think about this

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
picture

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,120
if you've seen github before this the

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
green

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
squares you know it's everywhere um you

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,639
see you see it where you're

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
walking around um and seeing like

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
buildings or like bathroom walls and

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,279
stuff like that it's like what is this

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,199
evoke in your mind and i think for

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
for a lot of people it's like funny

00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,920
maybe because it's like oh that reminds

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
me of github

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
um but i think maybe it might even evoke

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,760
a sense of dread

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
that maybe it makes you think of how

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,919
many github squares you have and that

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,480
you didn't have a streak

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,839
and it's good that they got rid of it

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
because we used to

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,480
feel like you have to commit every day

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,919
because of this external requirement

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
and so yeah there's like we have this

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,199
bias where like once we see something

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,079
it's everywhere

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
um and so you know looking at my

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,440
contributions

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,000
over the years um it looks like in

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,240
2016-17 i was like

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,840
at the peak and then now i went back

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
down and there's a lot of ways to

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
interpret that you know

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,360
did i get burned out maybe i'm spending

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,919
more time doing

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,039
things that don't show up on the graph

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,760
um

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,039
or you know who knows right i think that

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,720
this is the thing about data you guys

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,679
still have to interpret it even though

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
there's something there that maybe

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
there's a story behind it that's not

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,240
clear from

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
seeing that and unfortunately yeah a lot

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,520
of times we are

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,559
judged based on like what our github

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,880
graph says when you're trying to get a

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,160
job or stuff like that

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,160
and i think that's this symptom of our

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
you know society wanting to measure

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
everything

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
and not wanting people to spend the time

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
to figure out what someone's really

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
about

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
right uh and and it sucks that it seems

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
like

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
all of our lives not even open source

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,880
but right um through social media

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,120
are so public and then you don't feel

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,200
like you don't know what you can

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,440
how to really be yourself um

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
um yeah so here's an example monica had

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
this post

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,600
about explaining her year

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
through her github graph and this wasn't

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
like a negative positive it's just

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
saying that these are kind of the things

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
i worked on

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,480
i think that's really cool to kind of

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,360
look back and see

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
my progression but the fear is like well

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
are people going to judge me based on

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,400
like what

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,880
this graph says about my life and i

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,039
think jen had a great

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
post about this that you know it it

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,960
ultimately tracks code it doesn't track

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
you as a person your identity

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
shouldn't be even though i i feel this

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,520
all the time too that you're going to be

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,320
judged based on um your output right you

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,760
know you don't

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,080
where you did you you know you had a

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
a baby or you changed your job or you

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
moved like there's all these different

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,760
things that

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
you have to ask someone and you know

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,840
you're not going to

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,360
necessarily annotate your you know

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,039
github history like this and maybe you

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,960
don't want to and

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,640
i guess the pressure for that kind of

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,520
sucks right

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,200
and i think in general something that i

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,200
think is important is

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
realizing that emotions are a big part

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
of programming even though it's a very

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,080
technical thing

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
the reason why in this scenario this

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,640
tweet was talking about how

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,679
uh my friend omar he was taking a class

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,120
on um c and the

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
you can you can use the debugger to

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,640
figure out when something's wrong or you

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,640
can use like say console.log

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,640
i think a lot of people would rather

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
just do the console.log or print

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
statement

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,280
because it's a lot easier you're in the

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
flow and there's almost this

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
dread that you feel when you have to oh

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,039
i have to do this different mode click

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,400
on debugger and make it work

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,799
uh and so a lot of our tools don't

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
really

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,480
take that into account even even the one

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
that i work on

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
um so you know if you see a graph that

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,159
just is blank

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
right there and say i guess this was my

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,200
contribution graph in

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
when i first started um it it's almost

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,360
like

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,720
it just says that you you just feel bad

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
you feel guilty about not having

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,320
anything

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,760
um and and ivan illeg has this quote

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,000
about schooling it's kind of the same

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,000
it's actually worse than

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,520
to drop out of school than to not go to

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
school at all because it kind of tells

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
you where

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,840
you failed you know if you dropped out

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
in the first year then that's really bad

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,559
you know

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
um even though in tech i guess a lot of

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,400
people drive out

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
um you know and so how do we react to

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,360
this you know one way of doing this is

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
go back to the fun

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,200
thing again is like well that's why

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
people create these programs that

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,559
show how absurd it is to measure

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
people's worth through the github graph

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,520
by

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,960
you know letting you create a picture

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,080
that shows up in your

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,159
hub graph instead um and it doesn't mean

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,400
that like measurement is bad and that

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,919
there's some level that it's helpful for

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
you to track yourself or other people

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
but

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,799
we can't rely on it right we still need

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,280
to talk to people we need to

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,880
make that as an account and so there's a

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
lot of work that goes into even a pull

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
request

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
you know the time that you spent

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,120
thinking about the prom whether it was

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,880
even worth working on at all

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,520
maybe those things aren't reflected in

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,440
the the the pull request

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,520
um you think about all the different

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
things that go into

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,799
a community or a company or a family or

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,440
any

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,559
any kind of group not everything shows

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
up

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,760
even if we wanted to and maybe some

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,200
things we don't really want to be on

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,840
there anyway

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
and i like this phrase that ilitch came

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,720
up with

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,320
shadow work is work that is necessary

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
but it doesn't show up in the economy

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,400
essentially you know

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,720
taking care of kids um or you know the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
commute time to get to work right

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
you're still you're not really getting

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
paid for that but it's still necessary

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
and important for the work that's being

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,600
done

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,600
and i think even open source open source

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
is things that are in the shadows too

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,880
because even though it's public no one

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,240
really understands

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
what is going on because you don't have

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,520
to it's like kind of underneath it's the

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,880
infrastructure

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,480
open source itself has its own

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,679
maintenance that might not be seen

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
either

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,520
and so i just i guess just to say that

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,960
there's a lot of things in open source

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
that isn't just the code right um and so

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,559
you can be super valuable and important

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
to a project

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,960
even if you aren't a programmer and

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,400
you're still learning it for the first

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
time

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,640
even though i think we tend to emphasize

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,559
it too much because open source

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,960
at the core i guess has code in it but

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,360
there's all these things around it

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
so yeah there's a lot of things behind

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,520
the code you know these

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,440
you know avatars of people um that we

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,880
tend to forget i guess

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,919
um yeah these abstractions high details

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
right um it's like the janga blocks in

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,039
your

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,360
dependency graph um and that hides the

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,679
people that work on them ultimately

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,679
um yeah so i think there's this

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,600
difference between

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,200
uh using right a car or open source and

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
then maintaining it and

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,880
how do we kind of i guess lessen the gap

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,000
between people that

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,480
are creators and consumers right

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,039
and the farther away we are from what we

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
use i think it kind of

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
uh yeah i guess it kind of has a lot of

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,880
issues you know

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
basically outsourcing right we outsource

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,360
things to other people

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,880
um and it helps us not have to

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,559
appreciate what happens you know this is

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
true in terms of like say our food like

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,000
maybe

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
we used to make our own food grow our

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
own food now we go to the grocery store

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
or we order it

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
um and of course at some level you have

00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
to

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
you can't do everything yourself but

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,840
it's like how do we create a balance

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,720
where we can rely

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,440
on um each other and ourselves but then

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,480
not depend

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,799
entirely on these you know services

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
so i think you know this matters because

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,400
programming i guess

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
is the fear is that like everything will

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
become measured

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,760
and that like ai is going to do

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
everything but in reality the the people

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,880
are the

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,159
the ones maintaining these open source

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,000
projects so

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,520
um and i think that this is reflected

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,440
in the um or how the code is actually

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,679
formed like in in some sense

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,760
there's like these i guess ideologies

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
within the framework of the code itself

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,320
even if it's not explicit

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,400
um and it's reflected in the people and

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,400
so that's why it's so hard to

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
work with um a code base where you've

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,320
never seen it before and i guess that's

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,000
why open source is hard because

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,279
you know you don't know why someone made

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
something in the first place it might

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,559
not be written down

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,760
if it is written down it might not you

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
can't talk to them then

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,520
that would be a lot harder to understand

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,039
uh how it works

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,799
um let me i'm going to skip through some

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,120
of this because i want to get to the

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,120
yeah i want to do like a q a so um

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,320
yeah so the the code isn't all there is

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,640
i i guess that's all i want to say

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
um that open source projects are going

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
to have issues

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
the best companies in the world have

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,520
issues standards have issues so

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,559
if you think that you know everything is

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,679
working

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
um i guess that's really mistaken um

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,799
we have a lot of issues and a lot of

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,200
things that um if

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,120
if a project is so big the maintainer

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
can't put everything in their own head

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,919
right

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
and um they're going to overlook things

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
and i think

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,000
if you can if everyone can i guess

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,760
be um willing to ask

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
and like why is this like this maybe not

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,960
an accusatory way then maybe like oh i

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
never thought of it that

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,240
that way and that could be an

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
improvement to the project um i think

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,760
the willingness to

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,640
be curious and ask questions is really

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,279
great but

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,880
i i think that especially if you're new

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
you tend to have that more maybe

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
than the people that work on it because

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
they're so preoccupied with certain ways

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,039
of doing things um

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
and i i guess yeah keeping that sense of

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,000
curiosity

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,039
is really great um when you're trying to

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
contribute or make your own project

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,760
um yeah so programming is about the

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
theory the mental model that you have in

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,279
the program not necessarily just the

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
code it's just like kind of the artifact

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,880
that's

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,080
created from when you make that code

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,600
um and so yeah i guess

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,559
all to say that um the the people behind

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
the project

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,840
and the people that are using it are

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
important and even though we want to

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,679
hide behind

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,279
um i don't know the computer to figure

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,400
out how to or maybe not want to deal

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
with people we kind of

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,960
have to eventually um and

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,600
yeah and i think there's this uh

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
desire to replace people with you know

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,400
tools

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,480
but eventually those are the things that

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,159
kind of in some sense enslave us

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,400
you know being addicted to our phones or

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,000
whatever um how do we create these tools

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,960
that work with us rather than work for

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
us

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,760
i think is a really valid insight into

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,880
how we should think about i guess

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
technology in general but then

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,799
specifically

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:26,480
open source too um let me

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,760
um yeah so uh

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,840
i really like this example of the this

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
shrine where the people that work on it

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,200
they actually have to

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
every generation they destroy the whole

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,760
temple and they make it again

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,760
and it is an acknowledgment that um it's

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,480
not enough to have the documentation

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,679
or the tools to make this shrine but

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,320
that the people that

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,240
are in it are in that community have to

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
have the knowledge themselves to do it

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,840
so it's like a passing down of knowledge

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,399
and it's a really explicit way of seeing

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
this

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
um so technology we like to think is

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
going to be replaced by

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,399
i don't know um these documents or the

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,760
code itself like what happens if

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,679
um the people leave or whatever but um

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,039
there's a lot of things that aren't able

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
to be expressed through the

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
documentation

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,679
even though we want to try as hard as we

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,279
can to do that um

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,120
yeah so i get similar with cooking like

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,880
if someone gave me this

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,240
a really great equipment like knife and

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,360
a good cookbook it doesn't mean i'll be

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,799
able to make

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,480
a really good recipe um and and so maybe

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,039
yeah maybe that's why mentorship is so

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,600
important

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,600
uh for what we're doing um similar to

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,000
having the best editor or having a lot

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,799
of

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,799
commits um you know or having good docs

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,919
you kind of still need like

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,799
uh people to be able to pass knowledge

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,120
down

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,480
from one another maybe even more in a

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,919
one-to-one way

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
um and so yeah a lot of coding isn't

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,120
really

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,799
about coding even though you still need

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,480
to have that context

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,799
um and so yeah you can't really replace

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,320
people it doesn't mean to say that um

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,480
that people have to be these

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,440
uh celebrities or anything but just to

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,279
say that people

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,360
in general are important um and

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,200
even if you might feel the the guilt of

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,080
being a part of an open source

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,120
uh project um so yeah like can we treat

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
open source

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,520
projects even though there aren't real

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,799
people as sort of like this living thing

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,559
the idea that cities are living

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,320
not literally living things but like

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
metaphorically they're not just the

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,799
buildings

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,399
the environment isn't just this resource

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
that we can use but we want to take care

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,480
of it

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,039
just like open source maybe we can take

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
care of that too it's not just code

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,520
and i think this is kind of embodied in

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,440
this idea that we have knowledge that is

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,440
in people's heads it's personal it's

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,000
tacit it's more than we can

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,520
express and it takes time there's all

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,159
these things that we can learn

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,200
in tech and outside of tech that might

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,039
not be able to be

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,559
written down but it like it shapes who

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,080
you are as a person and i think it

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,200
changes who you are

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,880
um i i'd like dan's quote about how

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,760
there's all these firsts

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
um in open source you're never gonna

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,799
stop being a new person there's the

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,679
first bug first pr

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,960
first time you got angry at someone

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,760
first grammar fix you know all these

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,480
different firsts

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,039
um and you keep messing up and sometimes

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
you meet

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,640
some amazing people and so i guess i'd

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
like to hope that

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,000
this is from nicola one of my my

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,120
teammates on the project and he was

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,200
sharing about how you know that it was a

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,840
way for him to grow as a person i think

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,279
that's

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,039
really awesome to see um and so

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,720
this question of like how do we look at

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,799
the world is i think is really important

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,480
i work on this project called babel of

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,399
all things and you know if you know the

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,039
story from

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
the old testament about the tower of

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,200
babel

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,799
about how people were trying to get to

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
heaven and trying to build their way up

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,520
there

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,640
because they had i guess the pride of

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,760
doing that and i think it's

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,919
important for us as maintainers to

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,360
uh yeah to i guess would be okay with

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,080
being afraid um

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,440
and being just asking the same questions

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,640
that we had when we started

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,279
uh in the first place but yeah so that's

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,200
all i had

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,080
uh thanks um so yeah if you're

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,840
happy to take uh questions if you have

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,279
any specific thoughts on it i know that

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,440
was a lot

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,600
to go over so um

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,519
we do have one question in the q a

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,720
interface

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,320
okay i guess i'll stop sharing let me

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,159
see

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,679
that's okay um

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,200
okay can you still see me i'm not sure

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,799
if

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,279
okay we're able to see you

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,000
not your screen okay oh yeah i was just

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,519
gonna do my

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,799
video if that was okay yeah so

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,279
um so yeah a question um thanks for

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,720
taking time

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,480
do you have any recommendations for

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
overcoming lack of confidence

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
in programmatical thinking and not

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,960
feeling as if

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,320
one is making a fool of oneself what

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,240
would you think this is more of a

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,240
personality trait to overcome

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,080
good question um

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,039
yeah i think i think that seems to be

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
the prom

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,840
um it well i think that if you

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,960
are already a developer right um you're

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,960
already

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,039
writing code in a company or you know

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,640
maybe you made your own projects

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,399
i mean there is a sense that it's not

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,640
that different from

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,080
working at a company when like say it's

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,600
your first day right

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,640
uh you're going to have to figure out

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,679
how it works and of course there's an

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,760
on-boarding process people will help you

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,799
and i definitely agree that open source

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,840
is lacking in that

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:53,120
more than a company because i guess it's

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,120
their job to help you as a teammate um

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,039
um i don't know if there's no yeah i

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,559
guess there's things that you can do

00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,200
yourself but then there's also things

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,240
that

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,559
the project that you're going to

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,919
contribute to could do but and also it

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,120
depends on the project maybe some

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,080
projects don't

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,080
um they they aren't accepting

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,480
contributions that's possible

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,440
uh but it's good to kind of look for

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,039
projects that are

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
they're seeking that and i think saying

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,679
upfront like hey i'm new

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,960
um is anyone willing to like maybe walk

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,880
me through this

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,080
uh i guess just communicating that could

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
be a big part of that

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,480
um and if they don't respond then i

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,720
guess you can move on to the next

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,679
project because um i guess it's hard

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,039
because it's like

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,640
you want to expect that there'll be

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,320
someone there but it's like on the other

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
side maybe they have 100 people asking

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,840
so

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,960
it's hard to know um what that

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,320
yeah what that's like um

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
yeah but i don't i wouldn't want to say

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,840
that like certain personalities

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,440
can't contribute to open source or

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,559
anything um

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,480
i think you're always gonna have some

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,320
kind of fear and it's like

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
even after your major first

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,679
contributions i think you'll get used to

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
the workflow maybe

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,159
and you'll feel a little bit more

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,519
confident but you know if you contribute

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
to a new project that you've never done

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,880
before

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,919
it's still going to be difficult right

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,919
to figure out um

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,520
feel like you know what you're doing

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:20,240
because i mean it's not really expected

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:20,240
