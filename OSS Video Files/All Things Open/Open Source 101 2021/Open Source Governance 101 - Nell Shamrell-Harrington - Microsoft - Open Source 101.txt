Description: 
	Nell Shamrell-Harrington, Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft, delivered the "Open Source Governance 101" talk at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
It is one thing to put a project up on GitHub and call it “Open Source.” It is quite another to commit to growing and governing a project developed and maintained by contributors across the world. Both technical and community skills must be practiced simultaneously – a project cannot be successful with only one or the other. Come to this talk to learn about the critical duties of open source governance – including making it easy to contribute, troubleshooting, and managing contributions. Each concept will be accompanied by examples from real-life open source projects. Learn how to deal with upstream issues, how to say no in a constructive and empathetic way, and more!
