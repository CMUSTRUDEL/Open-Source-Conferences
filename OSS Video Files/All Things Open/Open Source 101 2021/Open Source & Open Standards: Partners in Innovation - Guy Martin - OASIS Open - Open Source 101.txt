Title: Open Source & Open Standards: Partners in Innovation - Guy Martin - OASIS Open - Open Source 101
Publication date: 2021-04-10
Playlist: Open Source 101 2021
Description: 
	Guy Martin, Executive Director of OASIS Open, delivered the talk "Open Source & Open Standards: Partners in Innovation" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
The COVID-19 global pandemic has raised the already bright visibility of technology to an even higher level. Our worldwide society has continued to operate and thrive due to foundational technologies like the Internet. Critical technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, SAML, and others are the underpinnings of what is keeping the world moving today.

Something all of these technologies have in common is that they are open standards with robust open-source implementations. In the early days of technology, the building blocks of strong open standards combined with open source code that implemented these standards set the stage for breakthrough innovations.

However, in more recent times, the once-close relationship between these two communities has eroded. It’s critical for our future innovative potential and survival that we rekindle the close collaborative tie between the open source and open standards communities. This webinar will discuss how we can make open source and open standards even more effective by helping them recapture their strong partnership. Join Guy Martin, Executive Director at OASIS Open, as he presents:

The case for why both open source and open standards matter for innovation
How to address challenges and find common ground between the communities
The role of foundations/consortiums in providing neutral open governance

thanks very much amber

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
so uh those that were that joined uh uh

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
earlier you got to see amber and i catch

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,480
up

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
so it's one of those things that in the

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
open source world um we know we

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
i think a lot of us have missed the you

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,640
know the in-person conferences today i'm

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,279
coming to you

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
live from the beautiful well sort of

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,760
beautiful

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,680
gray pacific northwest outside of

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
portland and you know i'm really excited

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,519
today to share

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
a topic that is kind of a personal and

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
professional

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
passion of mine which is finding a way

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
to navigate and improve the relationship

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
between

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
the open source and open standards

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
communities and really it's the

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
primary reason that i took the job uh

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
about a year ago now

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
as the executive director of oasis open

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
and i think the combination of the two

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
communities

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
is going to be critical not only to

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,480
where we are in technology i think but

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
to all of us

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,640
worldwide so

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,680
let's see if my slides work so with that

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
before you get

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
before you get started can you tell

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
folks about how if they have questions

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
throughout your

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
uh yes sorry thanks amber we were

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,840
talking about that earlier and i

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
got so excited i just went forward uh

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
feel free to raise your hand um

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
uh or type your question in chat and i

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
will make sure that we

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
amber will help me get to those uh at

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,240
the end so thanks everybody

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,680
uh where was i oh so uh oasis open um

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,119
some of you may know us some of you may

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
have heard of us uh maybe some of you

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,960
maybe not so i wanted to give you kind

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
of

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
kind of a quick overview to give you

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,360
some perspective for my presentation

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
uh we've been around since 1993 uh we're

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
worldwide organization

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
um and last year we were very fortunate

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
to form a european

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
nonprofit affiliate in the netherlands

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
to continue the the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
long-standing work we've done um as part

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
of the european commission's

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
multi-stakeholder platform so it's the

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,320
group in the european commission

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
that works on um and i appear apparently

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,799
chainsaws today apologies this is what

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,960
happens when you work at home

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
we're home to many standards that some

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
of you are probably familiar with

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,799
including

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,719
saml ubl amqp mqtt

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
and many others that touch your lives

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
even if you don't know it

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,599
for example the common alerting protocol

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
uh is the standard that

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,200
is used for amber alerts for missing

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
children in the u.s uh anytime you get a

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,239
severe weather alert or pretty much any

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
emergency alert that you get on your

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
device

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,720
is using the common learning protocol

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
which was developed here at oasis

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
many of our standards have gone on to

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
receive the jurais approval and talk a

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
little bit about

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
what digital approval is later uh and

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
finally we have a broad technical agenda

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
that covers everything from cyber

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,360
security blockchain

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
privacy sharing economy cryptography

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
cloud computing

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
augmented reality emergency management

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,720
pretty much almost anything that's out

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,319
there

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,160
and we have a membership that cuts

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
across public uh private

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
academic sectors and across industry in

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
general

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,720
so with that uh i wanted to cover

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,160
why open source and standards so it's

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
obviously the topic of my

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,159
my um my talk but i wanted to kind of

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
set the stage for

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
why i think this is important and then

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
hopefully kind of lead you through

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
um where we find common ground and and

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
and how we work as foundations to do

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
that

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,720
so with that um let's face it

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,800
obviously 2020 was a very tough year

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
right covet notwithstanding

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
it's there are a lot of other things

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,879
that happen and i think it's incredibly

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
important to acknowledge that

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,440
um so because of that i'm going to start

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,200
today by sharing a challenging example

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
to illustrate the importance of open

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
source and standards

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,440
and it's probably not an example you'd

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,280
likely think of when you're considering

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,519
technology or software

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
so in 2020 alone the western united

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,319
states so primarily california oregon

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,879
where i'm at

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,080
in colorado experienced over 8 400

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,120
wildland fires

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,760
burning 5 million acres excuse me

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
resulting in 9 500 homes lost and at

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
least as of as of the

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
most recent uh figures i saw 41 lives

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
lost

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,239
now clearly these are very grim

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
statistics but i'd like to

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
highlight that in the face of this

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,760
tremendous strategy

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,879
there are great examples of resilience

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
determination

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,959
and some great use of technology and

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
standards

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,280
and i was afraid my slides are going to

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
start going backwards they

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
tend to do this on zoom apologies um so

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
before moving to oregon three years ago

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
i had the tremendous honor and you can

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,560
see sort of the firefighter in the

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,040
background there

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
a picture of my on my wall um to serve

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
the citizens of california for 10 years

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
as a cal fire volunteer

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,680
cal fire being the the state fire agency

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
in california

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
and in that time i helped build our

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
volunteer communications staff which was

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
responsible for deploying communications

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
uh command post vehicles to wildland

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
incidents

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,160
and what would happen is on these big

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
wildland fires you have a lot of fire

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
agencies that show up to fight these

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
fires together

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
and we would all rely on the apco p25

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
digital radio standard to communicate

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
efficiently providing all the safety

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
critical information to firefighters so

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
that they could do their job of

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
protecting life and property

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
but you know as as all these different

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
fire agencies came together

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
most of the time they brought radios

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
from different manufacturers

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,600
which presented an interesting interview

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
to those of us in the command post

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
because we had to reprogram

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,039
large sets of radio frequencies so they

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,240
could talk to each other using that p25

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
standard

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
but because there was no standard for

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
writing radio data to these different

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840
radios

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
other than the standard of serial

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,039
each of these manufacturers had written

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
their own proprietary software

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
which really slowed the process of

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
cloning and programming these radios

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
because we had to keep different

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,720
versions

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
sometimes on different laptops you know

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
if the manufacturers had really all

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,680
instead contributed to an open source

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
implementation

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
that conformed to a standard they all

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
developed it really would have provided

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
a critical tool

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
and they could have shared the cost of

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
developing that software so

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
in short this situation was one where

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,080
there wasn't a competitive advantage to

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,440
be gained by proprietary radio

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
programming software

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,800
and really many things to gain by

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,120
standardizing it um

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,479
and the benefit of coherence standards

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
and the corresponding open source

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
implementations is not unique to just

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,479
safety critical situations like this i

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
think there are many areas of our lives

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
that could benefit significantly

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,960
from a better integration of standards

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
and open source

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,600
sliding back there we go

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
so let's cover some definitions because

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
i think i want to get some of this out

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
of the way

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
apologies that some of you some of you

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
may already know these things but i just

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,880
want to make sure we're all kind of on

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
the same page as we start

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
so open source right obviously you're

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
here at open source 101

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
you probably know what open source is um

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
but it's software it's available under

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
one of the main licenses approved by osi

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
or the open source initiative

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,800
but it's not strictly a licensing regime

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,360
i say this to people all the time

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,880
in in when i did open source consulting

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
at red hat and others that it's not just

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,160
about the license

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
it's really about the community and the

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
generally accepted practice

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
um of that community of individuals some

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
who work for corporations some who don't

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
that help develop that software in an

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
open and collaborative manner

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199
manner and to me that's actually the

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,599
more important part of open source other

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
other than just the license on the open

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
standard side

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
basically open standards are agreed upon

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
definitions

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
of functionality for a lot of different

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
things it could be hardware it could be

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,000
practices etc but we're going to deal

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,599
with with the software context here

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
and again our friends at the osi are a

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
great resource because they've developed

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,919
something that some of you may have

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
heard of called the osr

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,240
or the open standards requirements which

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
sets out the definition of what exactly

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
an

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
open standard is and the primary

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,080
requirement of that being

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
that the standards freely available

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,720
under license and royalty terms that

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,639
allow easy

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
and unencumbered implementation rights

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,240
for everyone so basically anyone can can

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
implement to that

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
uh if you further break down standards a

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
bit though we have what are called both

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,039
de facto and de jure standards

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,479
and de facto standards are usually tools

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
or systems that are not officially

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,080
recognized anywhere as standards but

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
they've grown through their widespread

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
usage to be the default school set of

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
many users so obviously microsoft office

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
is a great example of that

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
on the de jure side desiree means

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,039
basically by law

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
and these are standards that are built

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,360
and approved by national government

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
recognized standardization bodies like

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,319
ansi iso

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,759
itu etsy in europe et cetera

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
and they're usually built with broad

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
collaboration among among many

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
participants

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,960
and they are generally open standards

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,039
that provide great interoperability

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,520
between products from many vendors

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,599
and on the on the on kind of the other

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
side you have consortiums like oasis

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
ieee ecma wc3

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
probably some others that you've heard

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,519
of we don't hold the jury's

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
status but we can with the appropriate

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
governance and permissions

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
submit the standards that are created in

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
our organizations to these

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
international standards bodies for

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,839
delivery recognition so that they are

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
then then an internationally recognized

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
standard

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
by slides will cooperate yay okay

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,519
so where do we start in understanding

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
why open source and standards matter

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
does not matter to us so much in the

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
technology space

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
i really like to think we need to go

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
back to the future

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,440
and that's the beginning of the internet

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,240
so that picture there the imp

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
or interface message processor was one

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
of the first packet switching devices on

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
the arpanet

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,320
which some of you may remember as the

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
predecessor to the internet that we're

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
on now

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,519
but it did rely on common shared

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,640
software and on common communication

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,720
standards that even predated tcp

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
but as the arpanet morphed into the

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
internet that we know today

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
the bedrock is the bedrock of what we're

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
relying on to have this conversation

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
you had standards and open source

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,839
implementations combining

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,440
bringing to us things like tcp http

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
saml ntp xml json and i could go on and

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
on

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
the the many of these standards and open

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,760
source implementations

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
that we literally couldn't be having

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
this virtual webinar

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
we could be having it without those

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,680
things and without the seamless

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,440
integration of those open standards and

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,880
open source communities

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
i think it's really really important

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
that we recapture the spirit of

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
collaboration between the standards and

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,519
open source folks

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,839
as we continue to move forward in our

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,839
technology journey

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,279
so if you still don't believe in the

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
importance and the convergence of open

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
standards and open source can you

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,680
imagine

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
a world today but you probably can't

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,640
we're in code you can't imagine a world

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,640
today without the internet

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
you know in the face of the pandemic the

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,880
internet and virtual communications have

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
literally become our window on the world

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
and you know those some of us were

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
accustomed to making a commute i've been

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,279
fortunate last 10 years not to

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,680
have to do that i've been working

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,040
remotely at that time but for a lot of

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
us our homes have now

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
also become our offices um and some of

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
us you know we're used to shopping

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,079
online but now we're shopping online for

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,600
a lot more things groceries

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,920
and other things having them delivered

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
to our doorsteps a lot of us

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
have cut the cord with the convenience

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
of streaming entertainment services and

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
as someone

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
with a 10 year old two 10 year olds uh

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
streaming entertainment services are

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
really important

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,640
um and you know we're meeting our

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,279
doctors virtually now and

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,600
and until recently we just sent our 10

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,040
year old back to school but uh

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
you know children were attending school

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,240
virtually so in short

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
you know the internet's impact on our

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
daily lives has never been

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
more profound and without all of this

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,640
convergence

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
you know we could have ended up in silos

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
or islands of information

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,360
um for those old enough to remember the

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
aol and compuserv

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
sort of era we had those were islands of

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
information that didn't talk to each

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,120
other

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
so without you know this convergence of

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
open source and standards we could have

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,839
ended up with a very different internet

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
than we have today

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
so the covet 19 pandemic also has made

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
very very clear

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
that we need to continue to invest in

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,639
both open source

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
and open standards implementations

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
there's already been great work going on

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
here at oasis in these areas

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
we have the emergency management

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
technical committee which is home to

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
common alerting protocol that i

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,880
mentioned earlier

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
but also home to things like hospital

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
hospital availability and other related

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
standards

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,079
and additionally the as4 standard that

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
was built here is being used in europe

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,160
to help build

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,160
cove 19 data exchanges to help further

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
figure out how to address things like

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
vaccination and

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,639
other things but you know even with all

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
these great standards

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,240
and others that are hosted elsewhere

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
other than oasis you need good open

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
source implementations

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
and it's an area where public in

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
government and private partnership

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
has traditionally not been as strong and

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
so i think it's really important that we

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
make

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
sure that this kind of flourishes going

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,240
forward and you know

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
we learned a great many lessons as a

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
society because of the pandemic

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,040
and i think what we've all learned is

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
being better prepared from both a

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
mitigation standpoint with our

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
technology

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
as well as looking for new ways to

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
streamline things like vaccination roll

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
out i mean i know it's been a

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,519
huge issue in the us and europe

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
especially figuring out how to do

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,120
effective vaccination rollouts and what

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
role technology can play in that

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
so from the security perspective i think

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,920
it's also important um to think about

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
how open source and

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,839
open standards play together you know as

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,240
we become more reliant on technology

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,440
uh our window on the world the security

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
threat surface has increased

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
exponentially

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
and you know we seemingly hear it daily

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
about things like the solar winds hack

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
or incursions into critical government

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
systems or incursions into the energy

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
grid

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,160
and other critical infrastructure and

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
there are a lot of things uh

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,079
that we need to work on here both but

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
open source and open standards play a

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
critical role in things like

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
sbom or the software build materials um

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,000
and things like the threat

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,920
threat vulnerability sharing um for

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
example the open cyber security alliance

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
that we hosted oasis or

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
styx the structured threat information

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,440
expression standard or taxi

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,360
that trusted automated exchange of

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
intelligence information standards

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
so there's there's certain standards and

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
and

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
increasingly more open source

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
implementations of those standards as

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
well

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
and there are many large and small

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,279
organizations that are really trying to

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,279
tackle the problem of cyber security

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,120
so finding a way to that we can use

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,040
consistent processes to ensure

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
interoperability and the validation of

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,519
this threat data

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,760
is going to continue to be a challenge

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,399
and it's an area where i think we still

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,199
need to see

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
even more more and better collaboration

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
between open source and open standards

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
communities

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,279
so that we can provide the greatest

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
value with all this threat data that we

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,639
have getting it we have the

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
great threat data but it's getting it

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,560
out there getting it disseminated in a

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
way

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
uh that could be the be of the greatest

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
value that i think is one of our big

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,000
challenges

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,440
so we sort of set the stage of the why

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,600
let's talk about how we find some common

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
ground you know it's important to

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,880
discuss

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
so where these two communities are and

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
where they're the same where they're

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
different

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,760
and how they come with different

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,000
perspectives on how to solve some of

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,240
these same problems

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,880
the slides decided to be on cooperative

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
apologies

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,959
so you know rather the view open source

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,720
and open standards as adversaries i

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,399
think let's talk a little bit about how

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
we can come together to deliver better

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
outcomes

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
and obviously you know we talked about

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
the historical perspective but i think

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,680
in the in

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,519
in the historical perspective you'll see

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,360
standards activities came to live

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,279
primarily within legal departments

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
because you had patentable or valuable

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,759
intellectual property that bubbled up to

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
to legal from product and engineering

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
and as we all know open source

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,480
activities didn't really take that same

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,480
journey because the intellectual

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
property around them was

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,240
at one point deemed less important than

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
the outcome of what the what you're

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
building in the code

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
but you know um as i got further into my

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,199
role here at oasis

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,040
what i realized is that the desired

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,639
outcomes of both open source and

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
open standards communities are actually

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,759
the same and those are interoperability

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,399
choice and innovation and where these

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,320
communities

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,160
differ is in how they approach getting

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,199
to those outcomes and you know despite

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
these differences

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,880
i think they all have commonality on

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,079
what they're concerned about they're

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
concerned about governance they're

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,320
concerned about use cases

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
and they're concerned about their

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,800
approach to consensus

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,160
in practice there are fast open

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,040
standards groups and i know some of you

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,279
out there saying

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
past open standards that that seems like

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
an oxymoron but

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,800
they do exist and they usually work

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,519
really well with what we consider

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,519
well-crafted open source projects

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,279
excuse me and as a matter of fact the

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,120
goal we have of our open source

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,880
or our open projects program at oasis

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,959
which i'll cover a little bit more

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
later is to help bring these kinds of

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,360
communities together

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,199
because we think there's really

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
tremendous value in both approaches

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,519
um including both for the technology

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,720
creators and the consumers

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,880
one of the things i think it's important

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
to remember is that specifications will

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
tend to outlive code

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,880
and will need more agreement to ensure

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
that there's that long-term

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,759
interoperability

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,680
but often code can help drive standards

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:04,559
from a functionality and edge case

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:06,079
definition standpoint we'll talk a

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
little bit about the open what i call

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,160
the open development ecosystems

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,679
um it's really clear to me and just in

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
working with both open source and open

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
standards communities that defining this

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
open development ecosystem is critical

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,679
um and i think it's pretty clear that

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,679
technologies today are really more

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
interdependent than ever and sort of

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,120
formal data standards whether those are

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,720
open source projects or not

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,319
those things alone don't give always

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
give buyers confidence that the

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
technology that they're going to be

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,640
using or developing is going to be

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,960
interoperable

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
now the trade-off for the modularity is

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,919
perhaps kind of a lack of wide

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
interoperability which

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,120
really can drive up both short and

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,320
long-term development costs for an

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,919
organization

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,919
and if you take then the flip side

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
interoperability without that modularity

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,039
is just lock-in right

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,600
and i think a converged open development

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,760
ecosystem gives more choice to everyone

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
so one of the other big challenges which

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,679
we talked about in the coming together

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,200
slide

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
is finding a way to bridge that

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,640
intellectual property gap which is

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,320
bringing a balance of protecting your

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
differentiated intellectual property as

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
an organization

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
but allowing and encouraging supportive

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
um

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
and supporting non-differentiated ip and

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
standards

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,919
and in code and giving those more freely

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
to technology efforts that everyone

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,440
relies on

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,679
and i think that one of the ways to do

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,440
that is using major api interfaces as

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,200
the bones or the starting point for the

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,880
specification work because it's not a

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
big it's not a big heavy lift it's an

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
easy way to get started

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,960
it's a great way to start to provide

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,080
convergence between these two

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
communities

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
and you know it's really really

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
important to find good neutral

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
governance and robust processes because

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
there's a lot of roadblocks in the way

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
of making these things happen

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
and that's the critical role of open

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,280
source open standards foundations

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,400
which i will cover at the end um

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,440
so with that let's talk about some

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
hidden gems

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,960
that are actually out there today

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,039
because i've kind of made this sound

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
you know a little bit dire but you know

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
there's a lot of real hidden gems of

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
collaboration between the open source

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,799
and open standards communities that have

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,720
already happened

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,240
and you know i think you look at code

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,240
and standards have never

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
really been strangers so for example if

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,440
you look at ietf for the

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
internet engineering task force they've

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
been building this notion

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
of networking standards based on what

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,799
they call rough consensus and running

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,120
code for

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
for a long long time uh and our

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,679
colleagues at osi

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
you know created the open standards

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
requirement which we talked about

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
earlier which i think is again a great

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
way to

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
really give a critical mass around what

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
an open standard is and

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
helping make those standards more easily

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,400
implemented as open source

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
and here at oasis even before we started

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,520
the open projects initiative which

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,880
predates my time here

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,360
many of the standards groups that we had

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
would create open repositories on github

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
or

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,480
way back in the day sourceforge that

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
provided sample code or implementations

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
of critical parts of the standards that

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
were being developed

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,840
you know and i think another area where

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
oasis has tried to raise the bar

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
is really being about open standards um

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
and i'm happy to say that you know less

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
than 10

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,960
of the 170 plus standards that that

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
we've developed over 25 years

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
are require royalties to be paid uh it's

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,240
again one of the reasons why

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
i wanted as an open source person to

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
come to oasis and there were some in the

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,960
open source community that said that's a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
strange career move guy you're going to

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
a place that

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,360
standards are all about royalties but

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
you know it's it's great that

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,640
that we have such a small percentage of

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,960
our standards that have been royalty

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,480
bearing over the years

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,080
i think the synergies between open

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
source and open standards happen

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
in one of three ways sometimes the

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,440
standard comes first

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,400
this is the case with ubl this the

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,000
standard for

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
electronic invoicing has been pretty

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
widely adopted in europe

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
which generated a lot of local profiles

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,559
regional public projects and some other

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
source tools

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,720
sometimes the code comes first so

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,559
example of that is the star office

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
software which you know built royalty

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,080
free office document

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
spreadsheet presentation that later

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
became the open document format which

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,600
was started here at oasis and then

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
progressed from us through to an

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,000
internationally recognized standard

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
with iso and sometimes it's actually

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,080
form and parallel

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
in the case of oasis we had the mqtt

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
standard that some of you may be

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
familiar with the message

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,760
queueing telemetry transport standard

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,600
for iot sensor and device coordination

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,520
and that was started both as the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,960
standard here at oasis and then in

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
conjunction with eclipse there was an

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
open source project called pajo

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,559
and those two communities really were

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
able to feed on each other and i think

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,120
find a lot of um

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
a lot of commonality

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:34,320
so from here let's talk about balance

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,159
get my slide to cooperate there we go so

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,520
some of you know simon fripps from osi

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
and he wrote a couple of really great

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,799
blog posts recently comparing the

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,799
coexistence of open source

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,320
and open standards work to growing

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,520
blueberries in his garden

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
um and i learned a lot more about

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,159
blueberries if you're eating simon's

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
post but

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
uh having a separate place to have just

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,679
the right conditions for standards

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
is very similar to blueberries because

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
they can be a bit fickle and you

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,559
sometimes have and you have to have a

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,080
kind of a separate part of your garden

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,559
where you can grow blueberries

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,720
uh same with standards organizations a

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,600
separate part of your organization

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,000
that is related but has area that really

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,320
um

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
kind of provides the right soil ph and

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,919
the right conditions

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,679
um and you know open source communities

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,640
are sometimes characterized as really

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,039
unruly by

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
by by the folks on the standard side but

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
i think again it's just a different

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,480
perspective on how the work gets done

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
and finding balance to me is the most

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,440
important thing

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,559
here and and i think it's generally

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
easier to do

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
this kind of balance at a neutral body

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,200
like a consortium or a foundation

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,400
a key element of this is the governance

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,320
process that allows

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,640
both for a more rigid standards

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,280
definition uh to work with some guard

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,880
rails

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,799
as well as a more free-flowing open

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
source project and you know i'm not

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,760
going to belabor the challenges that

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
come with licensing and intellectual

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,559
property

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,320
and some of you will probably ask me

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,240
questions which i'll respond with the i

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
am not a lawyer i i know a little bit

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
but i always defer to

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,200
our lawyers on this but you know license

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,720
and licensing and intellectual property

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
clearly are a challenge

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
um but i think there's a clear need for

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,840
both businesses and participants

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,360
in these projects to find a way to come

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,039
to a common understanding about what a

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
compatible licensing regime looks like

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
and i think i

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,039
so one of the things i've been most

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,320
happy with my time here at oasis is

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,159
they've really done a lot of thinking

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,360
around what these these things like

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
royalty free licenses

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,120
and and using osi licenses on the open

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
project side looks like so they've done

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,640
a lot of thinking

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
in that area

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,679
so let's talk uh some about something

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,280
else here because we touched on a little

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,880
earlier but i think both open source and

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,880
open standards communities

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
obviously are after the same outcomes

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
where things tend to break down

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
is in some of the very different

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,480
approaches they have to both the culture

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,799
of the project or the organization and

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
the pace that both communities work at

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,480
so there's some things to consider when

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,559
we attempt to bridge these differences

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
um sometimes you need to determine how

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,919
nimble your standards process has to be

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600
does it have to be a traditional

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,279
standards development process that you

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
know some are probably used to

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,640
where you map out all possible use cases

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,120
from the beginning

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,880
or can it be more nimble and iterative

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
which allows for kind of naturally

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
occurring changes that are driven by

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,240
outside factors like an open source

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
project for example

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,520
and then secondly how much overt and

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,320
strong governance

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,679
should an open source project have and i

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,000
want to be clear again here by this i

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,840
don't necessarily mean licensing

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,679
but are there enough strong companies or

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,440
personalities that you need to have more

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,520
explicit rules of the road

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,520
um contribution guidelines things like

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,600
that or is it okay to start small and

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
evolve those contribution rules as time

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,880
goes on

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,640
uh third i think it's important to find

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
regular checkpoints where both groups

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,400
can come together to discuss their

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
latest efforts and find commonalities

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
and differences

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
so one of the the roles i had before i

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,200
joined oasis was when i

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
worked with the samsung open source

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,159
program office and

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,440
we worked on a standard and open source

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,000
project with intel called

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
oc oic we're now open connectivity

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,360
framework which is a lightweight layer

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,279
on top of iot um wireless protocols

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,720
and that was both a standards effort and

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,159
an open source multiple open source

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
efforts actually and so

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,440
one of the things we did was find these

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,039
regular checkpoints where both groups

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,320
sort of came together and figured out

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,080
what they needed to discuss

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,200
in terms of challenges that were coming

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,440
up in the standard or in the open source

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,880
implementation effort so actually being

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
intentional about finding those regular

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,919
checkpoints was really really important

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,120
and then fourth finding common tooling

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,840
one of the efforts that i'm

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,279
working on at oasis now is in finding or

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,440
and finding and defining what we call

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,640
repository based work streams so those

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,159
those who did engineering

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
have done engineering for a living or

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,799
obviously used to repositories

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,000
git github etc not so much on the

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,279
standard side so kind of

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,360
getting the standards folks to

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,360
understand how you potentially

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,200
write a standard in in that eventually

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,159
gets down into markdown and you can

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
crack things with

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,919
with pull requests and things like that

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,480
is a really really i think valuable

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,480
exercise

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,559
so with that let's actually talk

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,159
about the role of foundations and

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,520
consortiums um

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,360
and i want to dive a little bit deeper

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,360
here because i think this is really an

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
area where

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,480
you can you can get some serious value

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,679
by using

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
foundations and consortiums

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
appropriately um and some of these

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,520
topics are going to be a general nature

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,039
um applicable to a lot of the different

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,679
foundations out there but i'd also like

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,760
to cover

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
sort of specifically how we we approach

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,520
this at oasis

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,520
because i'm really excited about the way

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:38,960
the organization built this even before

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:41,440
i joined as their executive director

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,559
but let's talk about neutrality i think

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,440
when people ask me

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,919
it's really the number one reason given

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,760
by

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
what why what i think and why what i've

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,279
seen from from folks in the open source

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
communities and standards communities

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,880
it's number one reason given by by both

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,360
of those communities when it comes to

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,640
why do you bring your work to a

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
foundation

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
i think it's important if you're trying

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,480
to go for widespread collaboration and

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
really widespread adoption

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,679
your work needs to be in place that

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,039
doesn't have a vested interest in the

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,279
outcome of that work

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,720
now with that said let's be clear if you

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
want to build value on top of open

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
source or open standards it's not only

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
okay it's

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
really the point it's incredibly

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,240
valuable but providing a space where

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,919
partners

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,360
and even more importantly competitors

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,240
can come to work together on a

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,640
foundational piece of technology is key

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,520
and neutrality for me typically has two

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
dimensions

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,200
the first one is neutrality of

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,039
governance and process which is really a

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,399
common and agreed upon set of

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,640
kind of rules for the road for

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,559
collaboration and contribution

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
also neutrality of influence and

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,279
direction

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,840
i think while most work done at

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,399
foundations is naturally led by the

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
initial

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
project sponsor or sponsors it's

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,320
important that there be both

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
a balance um and neutrality in the way

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,760
decisions are handled about things like

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,720
finances and project directions so i

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
think

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,640
foundations give you a framework to sort

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,240
of manage that those challenging issues

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,000
and then in addition to neutrality

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,520
it's important to talk about fairness

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,360
because i think foundations and

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,399
consortiums are a place that can provide

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,760
fairness

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,360
where in the inevitable case of

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,480
disagreement and you're going to find

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,480
this in in

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,000
either within each of these communities

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
or even between these the open source

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,240
and open standard of communities

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,760
and the main main ways that the fairness

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
piece of this occurs are

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,240
consistent and transparent oversight of

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,919
the neutral rules and processes right so

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,880
having people who are there to actually

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,720
provide that that consistency and and

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,880
transparency and oversight

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,559
and then also consistent and open

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
enforcement of not only the process

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
rules

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,159
but also anything else that comes in

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,919
that

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,520
community covent covenant or more

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,679
importantly even things like

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,440
like codes of conduct and you know i

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,279
think both of these

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,039
really require unique skill sets and

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,679
talents that are generally

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,039
wielded by a group of individuals and

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,880
foundations

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,720
who you know we used to call community

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,120
managers or community shepherds i think

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,480
a better term is community stewards

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,080
and i'd like to kind of discuss a little

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,840
bit more about what that entails in

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,840
terms of community stewardship

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,559
so when i was looking to build this

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
presentation i found this great graphic

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,919
of what a community manager or community

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,320
steward looks like and

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,559
and having done this role myself i this

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
is very apropos with multiple alarms and

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,399
multiple things that you're doing

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,840
um you know community though is often an

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,440
overloaded or sometimes what we call

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,440
squishy term

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,120
but really strong community stewardship

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
is critical to moving open source and

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,799
open standards activities forward

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,320
and having built communities myself i

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,120
can tell you it's very difficult at

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
times

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,760
but you know i think that it is to me

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,039
like a systems level problem in

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,360
engineering which is you have to

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,640
understand a multitude of variables

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,320
and whether that's mitigating

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,679
disagreements about what goes into a

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
specification

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,200
or you know helping smooth over

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,039
challenges and what functionality should

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,320
be in an open source project

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
the community professionals and

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
foundations are the people who do most

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,360
of this heavy lifting

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,039
and as you can imagine finding people

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,520
with these kind of big picture thinking

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,640
skills the ability to communicate

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,480
the ability to help build these

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
communities can be a challenge because

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,760
the role is kind of

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,120
part program management part psychology

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
part traffic cop

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,200
part outreach and advocacy there's a lot

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,960
of factors that go into this

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,880
but you know my my experience is that

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,399
all successful foundations have one or

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,240
more of these resources

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,760
that that help identify who the right

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
people are to participate

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
um whether for the open source effort or

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,559
the standards effort um

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
and increasingly they're the people that

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,799
help broker this common intersection

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
between

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,640
between both of these kinds of

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,640
communities

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
so with that let's talk a little bit

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,640
about specifically how this works for us

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
at oasis because i think

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,240
i'm very was one of the reasons i was

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,360
most excited to join the organization

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,880
because you know there's the bill opens

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,120
the oasis open projects

00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,919
about a year before i joined as really a

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
place to support

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,960
shared community development of code of

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,559
api's standards implementations

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,720
open data under kind of one one umbrella

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,240
with open source licenses and a path to

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
recognition in these international

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,559
standards bodies that we talked about

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,159
and i'm really excited because i feel

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,200
like we're leading the charge in this

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,039
area

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
and we've already got projects that have

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,080
a strong energy and synergy between the

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
two communities

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,120
and and i think there's some some great

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,720
areas that that can really

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,200
kind of move the industry forward in

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,440
this space

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,360
so here's kind of what it looks like uh

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,519
for us one of the main things that

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,200
we offer is a consistent process that

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,679
kind of takes the traditional standards

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,000
work

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,440
as well as the open source work and lets

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
them come through

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,360
produce project specifications which are

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,279
very similar to the oasis

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,960
technical committee specifications kind

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,399
of the pure standard side

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,279
and after that they both enter our

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,200
standardization track if they want and

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
this can lead to becoming an oasis

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,919
recognized standard um

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,640
you know something like uh saml

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
and but then we can also help them uh

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
shepherd that

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,360
standard to get international

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,559
recognition through iso itu and sierra

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,320
or other organizations like that

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,360
but people ask why getting why is

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,519
getting the international standard

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,679
important i think it not only ensures

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,640
interoperability is maintained between

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,120
multiple future

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,720
implementations it really helps also

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,200
with highly regulated procurement

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,320
pipelines like medical and finance and

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,080
government and

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,279
and you know i did a lot of consulting

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,880
four or five years of consulting with

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,559
the us department of defense and

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,000
uh there was a lot of focus on standards

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,120
in the procurement process not as much

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
focus on open source

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,799
they're getting better about that now

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,200
but i think using standards as a way to

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,640
get open source more demystified in

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,519
these highly regulated procurement

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
pipelines

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,880
is really really important um one of our

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,840
first project

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,600
earth open source projects at oasis was

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,519
baseline the baseline protocol which is

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,720
a blockchain agnostic way

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,919
that you can validate private

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,679
transactions um on private ledgers while

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,840
only leaving public data about those

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,360
transactions in the ethereum mainnet

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,440
and again this project is a great

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,880
example of they built their open source

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,679
effort but then they took their api

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,200
definition

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,039
and used that as the bones of their

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,440
specification and they're in the process

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,919
of

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,760
finalizing their first open project spec

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,760
which you know hopefully will lead to

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,840
to a specification that will allow other

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,840
implementations of of that protocol

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,200
but what is our approach at oasis for

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,760
this i think really it's about

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,880
making open standards and open source

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,519
better together

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,799
so you know we've been pairing uh open

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
source and standards output

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,360
outputs as i mentioned since 2004 and

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,320
really we found that a growing number of

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,760
collaborations

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
collaborators were asking for this

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,120
hybrid approach they wanted outcomes

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,159
they wanted results

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,919
and really they wanted these

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,960
specifications these implementations to

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,840
be used so

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,039
being able to allow for um open source

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
and and other

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
things that maybe necessarily weren't

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,840
open source but allowing multiple

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,240
implementations and the choice of

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,079
multiple implementations was important

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,919
so on the technical committee side our

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,760
pure standard side they i mentioned they

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,440
can have open source repositories

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,520
um and our open source projects can

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,399
create specifications repositories for

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
documenting

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,839
everything from patterns data structures

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,839
processes etc

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,839
so let's take a little bit of a look uh

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,720
at the practice

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,000
of how this works at oasis so um we both

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,159
we attack it kind of from the governance

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,079
side the process flow side

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,280
and the intellectual property side and

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,480
we try to keep this approach

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,079
multi-dimensional

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
uh and there are a lot of industries

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,359
industry studies that have

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
have really suggested that you need to

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,399
keep your approach multi-dimensional to

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,399
address all three of these issues but

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,240
our design here is meant to encourage

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,240
really what i call the right amount of

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,720
process and efficiency curve to the work

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
so

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,480
um doing things this way kind of lets us

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,839
be fast when we need to be and lets us

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
be slow when we need to take a little

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,760
bit more time to make sure

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,480
that a standard is well baked and i

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
think it's

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,240
really important for me that we have an

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,240
opportunity for subject matter experts

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,760
and community contributors anybody who

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,960
who needs to come work on this they can

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
come work on this

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,520
um and though when you do that those who

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,359
make ip commitments are welcomed

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,200
you know whether their organizations are

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,400
members of oasis or not so we kind of

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
try to practice that

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
the open piece of especially on the open

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,079
project side that you can come and be

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,480
become a contributor without being a

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,560
member of oasis we do have member

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,480
organizations that sponsor these efforts

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
and and help keep them moving forward

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,200
so i did leave plenty of time for

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,520
questions we got 10 minutes looks like

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,359
apologies there we go

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,280
uh and i think really you know we have

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,920
as much to gain by bringing these things

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
together

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,760
uh and and very little for keeping these

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,240
open source and open standards projects

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,560
uh

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,079
separate so it's also really important i

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,680
want to kind of finish with this that we

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,280
don't expect every open source project

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,079
is necessarily going to intersect with a

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,480
standard

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,720
um and nor will every open source

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,280
project want to advance to a spec but in

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
reaching a certain level of maturity

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,960
we're really trying to bring the most

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,960
benefit from the organization

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,800
uh to what a standard standardization

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,880
activity can provide

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,079
so with that i am happy to take

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
questions and it looks like we have a

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,320
few

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,280
amber are you gonna i gotta do i have to

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,440
un do this so i can see questions

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
probably um i think the question that

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,240
you're seeing on the

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,680
q and a um was was one for jim

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,680
um and oh okay let's see

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,680
so i'm not seeing any new questions

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,280
right now

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,760
oh somebody's got somebody's gonna ask

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,079
me a tough question right

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,720
i hope so for those that are listening i

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,880
i hope that you've been pondering some

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,320
some really hard questions whether

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,720
philosophical or

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,720
uh engineering that you could ask a guy

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,240
oh it was so true love this graphic okay

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
i did have a question for you um and

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,760
since now i'm on the

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,800
cyber side of things like when you were

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
talking you know especially with the

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,640
solarwinds stuff and

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,000
everything that's going on what do you

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,280
see as the most

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,160
urgent need for standardization on that

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,640
side

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,240
on the side i think it's i think it's

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,359
the s bomb work the software bill and

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,640
materials work so

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,640
um you may be familiar with the

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,560
gentleman alan friedman uh at

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,760
ntia which is the department of commerce

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,760
um

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,000
part of their organization there's

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,760
really been a lot of focus and work

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,079
and i know president biden signed an

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,359
order an executive order for

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,119
asking the department of homeland

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,000
security and department of commerce to

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,480
basically go

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,160
figure out essentially the solution to

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
the solar winds and other hacks and

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,680
you know i think it's s volume or

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,119
software build materials is not a silver

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,480
bullet by any means but

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,320
just understanding what software is

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,079
what packages are in the software that

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,440
you you bought whether that's commercial

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,000
software whether that's open source

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
software

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,520
and remember most commercial software

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,560
has i can't think of many much

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,079
commercial software that doesn't have

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,240
some open source in it so

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,079
really understanding what is what's

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,680
comprised in in the software you have i

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,040
think is a really really important piece

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,640
that we're missing because

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,720
it's really difficult to um look at

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,760
i think combination of s-bomb combined

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,760
with all the threat

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,880
the threat information that can come

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,839
through in something like sticks and

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,560
taxi

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,000
is really kind of the the impact point

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,920
is figuring those those two

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,680
things out that's kind of table stakes

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,119
without figuring those two things out

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,480
it's going to be really really difficult

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
to mitigate any of these issues

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,280
awesome thank you so much you also have

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
a question from kristen and i'm going to

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,440
let her know you're going to answer it

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,640
live she says

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,320
what are some of the open source

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,960
projects that are directed toward a

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,240
standard

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,240
new or existing

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,000
uh well there there's there's a lot of

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,079
them we

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,760
we have a couple of them here at oasis

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,280
obviously i mentioned baseline

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,079
um uh there's work going on in ethereum

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,480
uh so cryptocurrency uh to figure out

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,320
kind of

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,920
what standards need to be to be brought

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,440
forward there um

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,520
there's everything going on again in the

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,000
open cyber security alliance

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,680
uh that that we have which is those

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,560
those things like the the sticks and the

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,480
taxis

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,079
of the world uh you know but it's

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,880
interesting i think that

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,359
kind of finding the the new generation

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440
of

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,119
those things that that need to be um

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,359
both a standard and an open source

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,960
project is is kind of a little bit of a

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,440
um i would say a crystal ball i i'd like

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,599
to

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,119
see other people kind of bring that

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,640
together again in those dimensions that

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,720
i mentioned both cyber security

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,480
especially emergency response i think

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,240
when i look at what's happening kind of

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,000
an emergency response and obviously

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,160
you saw the beginning of my presentation

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,240
it's a personal passion of mine

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,520
uh i think we're not there yet um i

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,440
think we're we're

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
starting to get there but everything

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,839
that's happened with covet i think is

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,640
finally driving people to say hey you

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,720
know what we

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
we need standards for how information is

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,800
exchanged we need standards for

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,520
you know how you you do vaccination roll

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,319
that you would like to tell people about

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
it maybe isn't

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,680
fully developed and you you just want to

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,880

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,240

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,839
right before the presentation or

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
actually this morning i got a bunch of

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,720
uh new stuff from my team about hey you

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,040
need to talk more about the

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,720
oasis open europe foundation and i kind

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,880
of backed off and i added some

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,000
mentions of it but um you know people

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,280
are like well i have to say you know

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
this isn't this isn't supposed to be a

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,920
sales pitch right for these things and

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
todd lewis is very

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,960
very intentional about that with all

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,480
things open and and i want to impart

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,160
information around the general

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
concepts but you know we're really

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,440
excited about the oasis open europe

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,640
foundation because we've been in europe

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
for a long time

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,040
um but this is really our opportunity to

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,880
have a body that's hosted in europe and

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,079
that can help derive

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,680
european specific um open source uh and

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,920
open standards activities and

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,839
you know there are there are places and

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
and you know worldwide we want to get

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,200
worldwide standards for sure but there

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,680
are places and specific

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,960
um factors that are european you're

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,359
specifically european

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,160
that you really need you know certain

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,920
standards that

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,440
are for you know european data

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,119
sovereignty is a great example right

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,960
there's a lot of work going on with gaia

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,040
the gaia x initiative around

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,720
data sovereignty in europe and so having

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,079
the oasis open europe foundation

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,760
which against a separate entity so

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,280
legally separate entity basically the

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,800
equivalent of a non-profit called a

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,359
stichting in the netherlands

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,240
um but that has the the tie back to

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,200
oasis

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,680
global but really has a focus on on

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,920
helping

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,200
drive those european specific standards

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,000
it's incredibly exciting

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,599
um you know obviously we've been tied in

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
work in the european commission

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,720
for a long time through dr carol

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:42,000
cosgrove sax who who leads our our

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,800
our efforts there around open standards

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,319
so

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,480
i'm really excited about and it was just

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,839
formed at the end of 2020 so we're kind

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,280
of just bringing that up to speed and

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,240
i'm really excited i think by

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,119
what that can do to help drive a lot of

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,800
these these

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,839
european specific open source open

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,839
standards activities

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,119
