Description: 
	Tracy Holmes, Developer Advocate at HashiCorp delivered the talk "I Found the Thing and Would Love to Contribute...Now What?!" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Contributing to an open-source project can be a very intimidating experience, but there are many ways to help out without having the “World’s Best Developer” trophy on your mantle! In this session, we will cover many different ways of contributing, as well as tips and examples of best practices to ensure your contribution will be accepted. From finding the right issues, understanding labels, community guidelines, to making my first pull request, I roughed through the trenches (in the snow, uphill both ways) to understand how to do this so you don’t navigate it alone. I would be honored if you accepted this pull request – let’s discuss the process of contributing so you’ll be on your way to making yours!
