Title: I Found the Thing and Would Love to Contribute...Now What?! - Tracy Holmes - HashiCorp - OS101
Publication date: 2021-04-10

Description: 
	Tracy Holmes, Developer Advocate at HashiCorp delivered the talk "I Found the Thing and Would Love to Contribute...Now What?!" at the Open Source 101 conference on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

Abstract:
Contributing to an open-source project can be a very intimidating experience, but there are many ways to help out without having the “World’s Best Developer” trophy on your mantle! In this session, we will cover many different ways of contributing, as well as tips and examples of best practices to ensure your contribution will be accepted. From finding the right issues, understanding labels, community guidelines, to making my first pull request, I roughed through the trenches (in the snow, uphill both ways) to understand how to do this so you don’t navigate it alone. I would be honored if you accepted this pull request – let’s discuss the process of contributing so you’ll be on your way to making yours!

uh at hashicorp and let's begin

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,080
if you have questions if you mistakenly

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,679

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,400

please use the q a as stated um but

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
absolutely ask questions throughout i

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,680
will try my best to spend eight minutes

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,960
per section on this so we have a little

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
bit of time and i can catch those

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,150
questions from you

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
so let me share my screen

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,160
[Music]

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,160
and we will begin

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,239
all right i see myself i do

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,079
all right so you did the thing

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
now what you decided that i have this

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
project that i really really like but

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,879
for whatever reason

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
this this particular reddit app has not

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
done this one feature and i really

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
really want to help

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,199
oh look they're open source how about

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,120
that well

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,879
what do i do now that i know i want to

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,239
help them

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,720
so i use notion

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,680
i do not have slides um i'm more of an

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
interactive speaker

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,720
so you will get a link to this

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
particular notion

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,640
section so that if you want to go back

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
and look at what we talked about that

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
kind of thing

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
we can absolutely you can absolutely do

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000
that so let me give you a little

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,680
background on me and tech years i'm

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
ancient

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
uh i've been in tech for quite a while

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,960
my trip

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
and journey over to software engineering

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,520
only happened

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,000
roughly four years ago um i am known

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
for being an almost austin texas local

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,200
because i've lived there so much

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
and or so many times and the last time i

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
went there i got this itch because i

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,159
became affiliated with women who code

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,920
um and decided i wanted to learn how to

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,360
code my brain likes puzzles my brain

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
likes trying to figure things out

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
coding nine times out of ten has

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
multiple ways to attack

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,759
an issue and so it works well with my

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
brain when i was a kid i always took

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
things apart

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
including my dad's truck he did not like

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
that i had to learn how to put it

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
together

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
but also we weren't rich we were working

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
class and so i had to put them back

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,840
together if i wanted things to continue

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
working and i did not want to get in

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
really really big trouble

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
that being said break fix comes

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
naturally to me um

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,720
and it worked served well when i was a

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
sysadmin and so now i decided i wanted

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,160
to learn how to code

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,080
um i was drawn to os projects mostly

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,080
because

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
they're open i like the idea of open

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
outside of all the licensing which

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,040
is actually in a different track i

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,560
believe uh so if you get to learn about

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,599
licensing today please do

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
it's confusing but it's great um but

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,160
i like dealing with the community um and

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
i'm very much a light bulb person so if

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,879
i can help someone let that light bulb

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
flick on

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
i'm down what i knew and what i thought

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,239
i knew so what i knew is i wanted to

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,680
work on open source stuff because like i

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,200
said i'm big on helping people i thought

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,239
it was cool providing things for people

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
to use and or

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,159
improve on improve upon and the fact

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,720
that someone from the community

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,840
could decide to help and make a an

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
impact on a

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
project that may have one or two

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
maintainers that's doing that on the

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
side in addition to a full-size

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,120
full-time job is amazing i thought my

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
previous customer ser

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
service and client facing skills would

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
prepare me even though the world was new

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
to me

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
and if you've ever worked as a server in

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,920
a restaurant

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
you'll know what it's like working that

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,599
working at those tables on a friday

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
night for the very first time it's scary

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,879
but it's exciting but it's also scary

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,680
i had no idea what i was getting into um

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,680
so interactions uh

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
how can i be effective at communicating

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
with the community we are all customers

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
at the end of the day whether i'm

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
working as a software engineer

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
if if i'm working as a developer

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
advocate that's

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,360
hugely informed by my software

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
engineering side at the end of the day

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
if i have an issue

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
with my electricity if i have an issue

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,920
with a product i bought

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
heck if i have an issue with my iphone i

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480
am a customer

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,640
uh and we get mad about things so

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
community guidelines can absolutely help

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,680
with interacting with the community

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
so i'm going to go into what

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,919
but i'm going to throw

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,840
i'm going to throw on my uh

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,959
maintainer hat apologies please could

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,440
someone let me know if they can still

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
hear me

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,360
my computer decided to switch my

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
microphone input all of a sudden

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
for some strange reason if you type it

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
in the chat i can see it thank you very

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,440
much tatiana

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,520
um so i'm going to throw on my

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,880
maintainer hat for a second and tell you

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,360
ideally how things are supposed to go so

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,560
uh one of the co-founders of hashicorp

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,880
mitchell

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
he uses something called apple and so if

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
i translate that to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
open source software it's approach make

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
sure you let the contributor know you

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,479
appreciate

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
them raising an issue probe ask more

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
questions or politely

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
push back um if you need to get that

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,240
missing info uh

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,360
present set realistic expectations and

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
trust me i get it

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,600
uh realistic expectations especially for

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
my particular company can kind of get a

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
little hinky aws will decide one morning

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,639
while they're going to the bathroom that

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,520
they just want to release a feature

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
microsoft sometimes we'll fix things

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
break it and then by the time you come

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
back on

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,919
monday after fixing it it's broken again

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
that's life though

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,800
and those are companies there's a lot of

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,280
stuff so do what you can to let the

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,400
users know when you can

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,759
listen so the open source community

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,160
can be mean at times um and some of that

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
absolutely is on purpose that's just the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
nature of people

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
um some are just frustrated like i said

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
we're all customers at the end of the

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,919
day whether it's a free product or not

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,120
um my particular uh company

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,840
actually has my particular company

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
actually has

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,800
an open source maintainer slack um

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
for feedback and response review when

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
that happens and i i

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
ideally i would think that other

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
companies have somewhere where it's just

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,240
kind of like a support group for

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
hey i need to give this person this type

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,319
of feedback

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,199
how should i best phrase this um and at

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
the end

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,639
ideally a maintainer will let the user

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
contributor know that hey we appreciate

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,039
your help these are the next steps

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,479
throw in a smiley one that's a pretty

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,800
nice smiley

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,400
and it'll go a long way so to say all

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
that it's not easy those are the things

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,520
that we

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
should do or should be able to do on any

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
given day

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
you never know how many maintainers a

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
project has it could be one person like

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
i said doing

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,039
whatever project on the side of a 50

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,560
hour a week job

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,639
also let me give my dog a treat because

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,639
if i don't he's going to start barking

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,680
community guidelines can help with that

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,520
um and so what community guidelines are

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
they're just that guidelines on how to

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,919
interact with the community

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
um how can i make sure that my community

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,720
is a safe space an inclusive space that

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
kind of thing um and so in the community

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
guidelines you typically

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,160
find two or three things uh you'll find

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
the readme the code of conduct and a

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
contributing guide

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
so the readme is often the first thing

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
you see when you're visiting a

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,160
repository

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,599
and it basically gives you five things

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
what the project does or it should give

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
you

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,039
five things what the project does why

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,840
the project is useful

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,120
how the users can get started with the

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
project where the users can get help

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
with the project

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,199
and who maintains and contributes to the

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,440
project

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
and i will go to a i'm going to go to a

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
repo to show you these things in a

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,639
little bit

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,319
the code of conduct is i feel like one

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
of the most important parts because it's

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
the thing that's responsible for making

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
sure that everyone's safe what to do if

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
they don't feel safe and that everything

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
is

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
inclusive the code of conduct is there

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,759
to protect everyone participating in the

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
project

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
as it defines standards for how to

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
engage with the community i mean it

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
signals an inclusive environment that

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
respects all contributions it outlines

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
the procedures for addressing the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
problems between

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
between members of the project's

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
community then we also have the

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,759
contributing guide

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
which is where all the guidelines on how

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,479
to actually contribute to the project

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,160
are located and in the general sense of

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
this particular talk

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
that's probably the part that we we all

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,039
kind of want to really talk about the

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
most

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440
so where in the world do we find all of

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,879
this stuff

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
you find it in the project's root

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,440
directory and so

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
let's go really quick over to two i

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,639
picked one

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,759
from that i for my job that i felt was a

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
good example and one that i've

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,360
contributed to in a minor way

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,880
um so when i was learning how

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,120
to uh when i was learning go going

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
uh one of the the resources that i used

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
was a book called

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
learn go with tests um it's an open

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,279
source book it actually lives on git

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,720
book

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,880
but the repo is freely available

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,279
uh and so this particular author

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
author is very open to feedback

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,120
submitting issues and that

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,519
that kind of thing so the root directory

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
is basically just saying it's in

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,800
it's the it's in the main path of the

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
repo um

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,040
and for the contributing guide here

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
it should be down here somewhere if i

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,959
don't find it i had it i don't know

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,880
where it went so we'll come back to it

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,760
uh yeah let's go to the readme instead

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,120
so whenever you get on on the refund if

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,760
you go to the readme it'll also

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:27,040
typically link to the contributing guide

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,240
but this is what the readme looks like

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,200
and as you see it has a link to the

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
contributing guide we're actually going

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
to come back and talk about the

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,720
contributing guide more later

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,399
this one lives in the root directory in

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
the particular

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
provider repo that i chose from my

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
company

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
it no longer lives outside of the readme

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,720
it no longer lives

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
in the main directory it used to live in

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,680
something called the get

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
the dot github directory which is

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
basically a hidden directory

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
and that's where like the issue

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,000
templates and stuff live so it used to

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
live in here

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
and we're going to talk more about issue

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,240
templates and that kind of thing lately

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,800
but if you hear me mention the

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,000
dot github that's what i'm talking about

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,040
um that dot github folder is it lives on

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
the default branch

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
um it can be home to community health

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,279
files like the contributing guide issue

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
templates and code of conduct if you

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,360
have more than one

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,959
like if you have something outside of

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
the readme and you have all of the other

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,320
things you can usually group it under

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,959
that hidden directory

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,279
okay so how do you determine what to

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,200
work on

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,800
so let's talk about different types of

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,800
things that you can work on

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
you work on roughly three things these

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
are usually the general things across

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
the board

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,760
documentation bugs

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,519
and or features so your documentation is

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
going to be things like typos screwed up

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
code samples

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,560
missing code samples or even suggestions

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
these are all good contributions i mean

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
if you've ever heard me heard me speak

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
before you will know i am known for

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
saying documentation counts and that it

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
will be on my tombstone that is the heel

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
i will die upon uh

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
bugs so your bugs are going to be like

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,160
the filter's not working properly

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,600
um example base codes not returning the

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
correct info

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
things that you can let the maintainers

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,959
know about

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,600
and then we also have features so if you

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,839
decide like i used a reddit app earlier

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
um say like apollo or something and you

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
decide that you have an idea for

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,240
the formatting you want some more detail

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
when you're using it you want something

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,560
changed because you don't like how it

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,800
looks on your particular um

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
phone then you can file that as a

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
feature request

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
and even if they don't agree most

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
maintainers will get back with you and

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,959
say hey

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,000
uh this thing this is not a thing

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,760
that we can do and this is why

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,360
um i'm what i said a few minutes ago is

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
that i'm very big on documentation

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,880
and i feel like i still feel like even

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,519
when i first came in

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,480
um that people don't consider

00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:01,600
documentation good contributions

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,519
and contributing is only related to code

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
if you believe that if you internalize

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
that i need you to take this particular

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
statement whenever i share this notion

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
app

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,600
copy it and paste it somewhere that you

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,600
can see it every day

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,240
a contribution is a contribution um

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,079
and i felt like that and to this day i

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
probably do still feel like that

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
um we have a lot of senior engineers

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
that forget what it was like to be a

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
junior sometimes

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
i also know that a lot of senior

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,079
engineers

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
are routinely working on teams where

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
they don't have enough people on the

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
team

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
so if they can't get if they're so busy

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
working on the code who's taking care of

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
the documentation

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
they may miss something they may copy

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,639
paste we might have

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,839
bad copy pasta whatever if you see a

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
typo in something

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,079
absolutely use that as your first

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
introduction into contributing to that

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,000
particular project

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,360
if they missed a semicolon if they

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
missed the highlighting feature if you

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,880
notice the markdown is messed up

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,200
submit that issue and while you're at it

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,519
put in a pull request they will

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,000
appreciate you i have a co-worker now

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,079
where we just did a live stream and he

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
was

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,480
he was very adamant that documentation

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
is on his list but if you have to go

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,560
back and fix

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
all of the documentation that's not a

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,560
one-day job so yes

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,519
i'm sorry i will get off of my soapbox

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
um

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
all of that to say this the engineers

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,279
don't always

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
catch the mistakes so that's what the

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
community is there for

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
the learn go with testbook was actually

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,279
my very first contribution to an

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,360
outside repo or one of the first i i was

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
learning and i realized that there were

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
there was output that he was giving in

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,920
the book that did not match up with the

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,360
output that i was

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,720
i was uh returning in my terminal and i

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
was using the same version and all

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,279
and everything that should have been

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,720
used and i put in an issue and he

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
very politely said if you want to do a

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
pull request for it go go for it

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
look at look at what you need to do in

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
order to get that done and i submitted

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
it and he merged it and i was like hey i

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,040
used i was able to contribute to

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
something that i actually

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,160
use and i can go back and look at that

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,480
and go i did that

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,120
um so those are the different types of

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,160
things that you can work on

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,160
so let's talk about labels um and if you

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
think about labels like your t-shirt

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
labels you're not wrong

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
just remember if you don't have a label

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
you don't know what size t-shirt you're

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,279
wearing so if you rip it out

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,959
how do you know github says and i'm

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,320
going to use github's definition of a

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,320
label

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
labels on github help you organize and

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
prioritize your work and i would think

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,959
that that also applies to other version

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
control systems like i use

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,639
gitlab for my private stuff or my

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
personal stuff you can apply labels to

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
issues and pull requests to signify

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,199
priority

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,639
uh category or any other information

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,160
that you find

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:52,079
useful but how do you even know

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,880
how to navigate the labels um

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,560
so let's go look at that how do you know

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,839
how to navigate them and how do you even

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
know where to find them

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
and don't forget if you have any

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
questions or you want me to go back so

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
you can see something absolutely pop

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,839
that in the q a or even the chat and i

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,680
will do my best

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,480
so you won't see labels um in the main

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,839
code in the main part of the repository

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
um

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
what you have to do is when you're

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,000
looking at issues this is how you'll

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,720
how you will find your labels and it's

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
literally

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,399
a label drop down at the top these are

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,720
not always consistent

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,519
um especially if it's a big project um

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
or different

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
tools or that kind of thing is just

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
sometimes they can be siloed and or

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
isolated and they use their own labeling

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,839
system for the most part

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,720
um the basics are usually there like

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,360
good first issue

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
or um help wanted things like that or

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
even hacktoberfest because hacktoberfest

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,079
has gotten so popular

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,320
so like for this one the author even has

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,440
one for boosting his ego uh which i

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,759
think is hilarious

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
but a bug you want to label something as

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,040
a bug that way if you decide to go in

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
and you want to start working on bugs

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,160
like you feel confident that you want to

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,839
go past documentation

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,839
you can go and filter things by bugs um

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
this is a duplicate tag it's kind of

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,839
self-explanatory sometimes people

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,000
don't if it's a big project people don't

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,360
always want to go through

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
500 issues they'll just file another

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,560
issue and a lot of times it's a

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
duplicate of another issue so that's

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,399
what the duplicate tag is for good first

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,399
issue we'll talk about that a little bit

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,839
um i think in the next section i wanted

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,079
literally we need some help with this

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,759
particular one new chapter in this case

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,959
he's writing a book so a new chapter

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,920
would be the

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,440
label and then question or won't fix so

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
i mentioned earlier that they will tell

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
you if they will fix something or they

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
will

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,000
add a feature or they want to add a

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,839
feature there's a label for that

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,240
um and if you decide you want to see

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,480
what bugs are in this particular

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
repository click on bug and it will

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,800
filter everything as a bug

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,880
so it doesn't look like there are any

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
current bugs

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
so let's go over to the other repo from

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,480
my job now

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,319
this particular repo has 2000 issues

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
and now you can see where those lit the

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,199
labeling system starts to

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,240
to come in handy um especially if it's

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,839
color-coded

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,600
all the bugs are going to be red all of

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,319
the crashes are going to be red if we're

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,120
talking about a specific version or

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,880
testing

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,319
it looks like that's green if something

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
needs triage which means it needs a

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
closer look to make sure that it's

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
getting

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,520
thrown to the right area or right person

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,559
that's responsible for that

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,400
particular thing that's what that is

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
um and you'll notice labeling for a

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
company is probably different

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
is different from the one for the book

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,280
and that we have a breaking change

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,200
which means if we decide

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
this issue is valid but if we decide to

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
implement a fix for this issue it's

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
going to break the functionality of said

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,000
tool

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
um bugs self-explanatory we just talked

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,600
about that a crash is literally that

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
you were working on something and it

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
crashed when you have a crash it will

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,520
give you output

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
use that output when you do your um in

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
that issue and that's how we know that

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,919
it needs to be labeled as a

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,320
crash um enhancements uh you will see

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,160
feature requests and or enhancements uh

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,559
used interchangeably a lot of times so

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,679
if you

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
if you have a feature request make sure

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
that

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
you don't ask where that label is it

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
might actually be labeled as an

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,320
enhancement

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,080
examples um github actions is pretty new

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
across the board because that's fairly

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
new

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
um good first issue like we saw in the

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
other repo hacktoberfest like we saw in

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,039
the other repo so you will see some of

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
the same things needs triage

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,880
so you do have some general labeling

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,840
systems that are across the board

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,679
on projects so let's go back

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,720
here we've already discussed what the

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,039
labels mean

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,360
so i mentioned um so what issues are

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,320
good for newbies and i still love these

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,000
and then i have a a slightly smaller

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,280
soapbox

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,039
so how to find newbie friendly labels um

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
so to attract new contributors issues

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
with labels that start with good first

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,320
issue or help wanted are featured

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,520
on that dashboard that i just showed you

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,919
that's usually across the board

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,240
the small soap box i have is sometimes

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,039
people forget that what is a good first

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
issue

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,200
to them is exceptionally difficult for a

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,960
newbie

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,080
uh and so this is me saying maintainers

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,160
find a way to

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
to uh add a note or something in there

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
to let them know hey this is a good

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
first issue but if you're not

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,679
comfortable with this

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,280
like put that in your contributing guide

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,720
or let them know hey

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,120
when we say good first issue this is

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,960
what we mean help wanted

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
if you know that you're knowledgeable

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,039
about the code base whether it's in

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,760
python if it's in ruby if it's in go

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,480
um in this particular instance we use go

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,400
at our company

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
for the most part then help want it

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
won't necessarily be easy

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
but you'll know that they specifically

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
need something or need assistance on

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,320
that particular thing

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
um and we just looked at good first

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,120
issues or help wanted

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,640
and if someone wants me to go back and

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,480
like filter out by what those may look

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,240
like in either of those repositories

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
pop that in the chat i have no problem

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
going back

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
if you see nothing geared towards

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,559
newbies you can approach this one or two

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
ways

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,720
if you don't want to do documentation

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
and you want to start you've gotten that

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
you've gotten more confident in your

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
contributions or in your knowledge of

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
said code base or language that they're

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,080
using being the maintainer say hey

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
look i really want to help you out with

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,120
this i noticed you don't have

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,880
this um are you all going to have any

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
good first issues coming up in a new

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
feature soon

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,840
do you anticipate needing help for

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,440
something because a lot of times

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
especially if it is a side project

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,720
they may have just forgotten to label

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,320
something

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
and you may give you giving them that

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,000
nudge by asking that question

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
will let them know hey okay i have

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
somebody here that really wants to help

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,960
let me go see what i can find and they

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,280
may just get back to you and say hey

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,320
give me 28 uh 24 hours give me

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,840
72 hours give me whatever and check back

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,720
and i'll see if i can get some stuff for

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,679
you

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,360
um all in all to be completely honest

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
it's all about communication open source

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,679
the open source community

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
thrives on communication um and when

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
that communication is not there that's

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,760
when things start to crumble

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
um so examples of resources that are

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
focused on helping people make their

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,000
first pr

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,440
i've changed this a little bit i used to

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,559
be all in on hacktoberfest but i

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
realized there are other things that

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,120
people can

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
can use and if you want me to click on

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,600
these i can also

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,200
uh do that but whenever you get the link

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
to this particular talk

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,039
these are all linked so you should be

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,840
able to click on them to go to the uh

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,679
their pages associated pages oktoberfest

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
is the most popular one i think

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
and that you get everybody knows about

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,159
the t-shirt um

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,120
and it's usually let me guess

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,559
october um open source friday i don't

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
know that many people know about open

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,679
source friday

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
um but it's if you click on that link

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
it's gonna take you to a page that

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,840
basically says hey

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,520
try to take some time out every friday

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,200
to give back to the community by

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
contributing to this particular project

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
or one of these projects

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,559
um and it'll help you decide what you

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
want to work on first timers only is

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,520
just that

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
that's a really really good one for

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,000
people that have never

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,679
ever ever in their life made a pr um

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
and you will see that tag in certain

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,320
repos um and they love it

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
um they will link you to something where

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,159
you can do that one little thing

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,520
to get to that first pr and i know it

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
doesn't sound like a lot

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,720
but that adrenaline rush from seeing

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,480
something you've done

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,440
like get merged and it's in a thing

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,679
it's great like it's great uh first

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
timers only has a link to resources

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,799
um it will also help you find out what

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,960
you want to work on first time is only

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,880
if i'm not mistaken still has a twitter

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,799
bot so if you don't remember to go to

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
the page to check on things

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,919
absolutely subscribe to um that twitter

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
handle

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,720
and whenever they post you'll get a

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,679
notification and turn on the

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,679
notifications so you can get a

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,360
notification when they post new things

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
um that's what i ended up doing because

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,080
when you get busy you kind of just don't

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
think about the 90

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,080
chrome tabs you have open in multiple

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
windows um and then 24 pull requests 24

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
pull requests didn't do anything

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,760
last year but it's usually in the uh in

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,039
december on the days leading up to

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,799
christmas

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,440
and you're supposed to do a pull request

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,080
a day what they do still have

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,919
um is also external they have links to

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
external resources or

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
reposts that they know need help so all

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,320
of these are all active pages that you

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,880
can click on as soon as you get this

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,200
um and let's see let's go back to

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,039
contributing guides

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,000
what in the world is a contributing

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,279
guide we're going to go back to what

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,279
github says

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
so for the repo owner contrib uh

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,520
contribution guidelines are a way to

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,480
communicate how people should contribute

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,440
for contributors so us the guidelines

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
help

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,480
verify that we're submitting well-formed

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,320
pull requests and opening useful issues

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,919
and then for all parties involved the

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
guidelines save time and hassle

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
caused by improperly created prs or

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
issues that have to be rejected

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
and resubmitted make note of that

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
because we're going to walk through

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,960
a checklist that i think is very well

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
done

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,880
and you should have no questions once

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,400
you go through that checklist

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,840
so we saw earlier where the contributing

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
guide was for learn go with test it was

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,520
in the main

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,760
uh it was in the root directory in the

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,480
aws provider repo we looked at

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,240
it i mentioned this that it used to live

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,760
in the dot github directory we discussed

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,640
but now it lives in docs

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
so if you don't see something if you go

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
looking for

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,320
the contributing guide and it's not in

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,600
the root directory and it's dot github

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,279
look for something that would indicate

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,559
that documents are there and nine times

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,039
out of ten it'll probably be

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
a um a docs holder so we're gonna walk

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,960
through that

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,799
um a little bit and i use it

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,120
because like i said i think it's very

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,400
well formed but it has check boxes

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,020
utilize those check boxes so let's go

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
look at that really quick

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,559
[Music]

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,480
great so let's go back to

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,400
the main page and we're going to go down

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,400
to docs

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
also if you don't want to do it that way

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
nine times out of ten you can just go

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,600
down here and click

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:19,679
on a link directly to it

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,679
so let's do that so first things first

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
they have i remember when this didn't

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,600
look like this so i'm kind of i love

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
this one

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,360
all right so they have everything broken

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
up into bullets

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,880
before you can do anything you have to

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,960
get your environment set up

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,200
so this is this particular section will

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,679
tell you your requirements so hey

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
if you're using go you need to use 1.16

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,720
because you'll need it to build

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,320
the provider plug-in for this particular

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,279
project they'll tell you how to do

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,120
testing

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,200
they'll also tell you what you need to

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,039
do in order to make things work

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,760
where the paths what paths you need all

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
that kind of stuff

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
the next thing is the issue reporting

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
and the life cycle and let me double

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,799
check something before i go

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,080
past where i am yeah actually these two

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,159
things will work together so we'll just

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,480
we'll just do it all at once

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,919
um we're gonna go through the

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,440
contributing guideline and i'm going to

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,240
associate it with the path to your first

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,840
pr

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,120
on your way to your first pr you need to

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,200
ask yourself these questions am i

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,200
submitting an issue

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,039
am i submitting an issue and a fix for

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
said issue so a pr

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,720
or am i or if i found an existing issue

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
that i'd like to fix

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
um there are three types of issues

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,679
you've got bug reports

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,159
feature feature requests and questions

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,559
and

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,960
there are usually issue templates that

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,520
you need to fill out

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,120
but the location and the type will vary

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,159
depending on the project that you're

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,320
contributing to

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,000
but these are the usual suspects i will

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
say if you found an issue you'd like to

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
fix

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
make sure that no one else is already

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
assigned to it i'll show you what that

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
looks like

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,600
um when we go back to the aws provider

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,240
ricoh and if you don't see anyone

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,279
assigned just throw a note uh not a note

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,039
throw a comment

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,640
into that particular issue and say hey

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,159
if no one's working on this i would like

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,360
to work on this usually the maintainer

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,440
will get back to you

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,559
um in a reasonable time if they can and

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
say hey go for it

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,600
uh no one else has this and thank you

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,080
for your assistance

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,880
um before i flip over yeah an issue

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,159
actually it

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
you submitting an issue is still a

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,120
contribution how am i gonna know there's

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,320
an issue if you're not telling me about

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
it um

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,399
and how will i track said issue in the

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,919
future in case it happens again

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,440
so if you're whether you're providing a

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,120
fix or not make sure you're submitting

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,880
an issue and follow any of the templates

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
that make sure you follow that you fill

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,399
out the

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,320
corresponding info so if you see

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,320
we have an issue reporting a life cycle

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,840
and if you look at this it has a

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,679
breakdown for each of the three

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,080
types that i told you about on issues

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,679
but it also has a check box

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,679
you can use these check boxes

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,600
once you clone the repo just go in and

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,760
have fun or

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,360
just take the raw and put it in a

00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
markdown file so you can have something

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
to click

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,000
i like checklist this works very well

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
with me

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,200
it also will tell you what you need to

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,200
do

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,960
for your pull request submission and i

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
feel like if nothing else is important

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,120
in this entire

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,960
checklist this is because if you don't

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,320
follow the rules that they gave you for

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
your pull request

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,799
you'll wonder why you why it's not being

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
acted on

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,919
um if they tell you need to label

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
something a certain way or you need to

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,480
follow

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
some sort of convention for the code

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,200
follow it

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
if you can follow this as closely as

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,039
possible um

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,200
then you shouldn't have any issues for

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,679
it getting reviewed when you don't

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,360
and you just want to get a pr in for the

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,520
sake of getting it done

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,679
you'll notice you'll get either pushback

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,000
or no response at all

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,039
um so make sure you follow these types

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
of things um

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,440
and in this instance it will tell you

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,880
about the life cycle

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,000
you will also find this

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,679
so if you are if you are creating a

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
branch

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
this particular project lets wants you

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,640
to

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,240
prefix it with specific things to denote

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,960
specific things so like if you're

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,320
submitting a feature branch you would

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,960
start it off with feature

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,279
with f for feature b for bug fix b for

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,640
documentation that kind of thing

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,720
um the other thing is they have a common

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
review items and so they have common

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
practices

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
that they want you to go through to make

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,440
sure that everything's formatted

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,880
correctly and that kind of thing

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
as well as link you to things like

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
effective go and go code review comments

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,960
in case you're wondering well why do i

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
have to do this

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,120
click on go review code review comments

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
and it'll let you know why

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,880
and these are the guidelines again use

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,200
these checklists they're there for a

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
reason

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,320
and what was the other thing um

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,760
and then contribution types they even

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,679
have something

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,440
to let you know what you need to do in

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,440
the event of a documentation update

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,279
enhancement rebug fix adding resources

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
uh resources are specific to this

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,679
particular

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,960
project it's something that they use and

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
if i show you the labels again you'll

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,760
see why

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,360
um but yeah contribution guidelines so

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,880
if you want to know what a resource is

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
this is a sidebar sorry

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
this particular provider works a lot

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,159
with services so

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,840
if you wanted to go look specifically

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,039
for a service i'm going to show you how

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
this filtering works if you want to look

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
for a specific service and you know that

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,279
you want to work for a work on an api

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,039
gateway issue

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,640
click on that and it will filter out

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,880
everything associated with that

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
so that's where in these big projects

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,080
the labeling comes in handy

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,960
and you can filter it down you went from

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,080
2.5

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,640
2 000 issues to like 20 or 15

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,640
open ones

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,840
all right

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,440
and then i believe

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,760
we have uh

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,279
so you can help when you get stuck all

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,159
right i think i can talk on this one

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
without having to

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,720
to go into too much detail if you get

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,679
stuck do not do what i did

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
and get scared because you didn't want

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,279
to admit

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,279
that you were stuck

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,640
don't get scared you're because you know

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
this is your first time doing a pr or

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,000
even your fifth time it gets easier over

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,600
time but even at the fifth one you're

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,679
still new

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,440
you're scared that on your fifth pr that

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,200
senior engineer that maintains that

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,679
project is going to think that you're

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,240
stupid

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,200
you do not want to sit there and not do

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,960
it because

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
you don't know this person and even

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,480
though they gave you a list of rules

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,760
you still feel like you didn't do

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
something and so you're double and

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,279
triple and quadruple checking yourself

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,279
and now you're second guessing yourself

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,080
and don't do what i did and just don't

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,960
do anything at all

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,760
um i said earlier communication is king

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
communication

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,000
i made a joke about microsoft earlier

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,600
but i'll give you a specific instance

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
and you'll see why

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,799
that actually did happen on one thing

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
where something was broken we found a

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,200
workaround it was working over the

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
weekend and when we came back to work

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,799
monday it was broken again and we were

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,720
like what the

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,720
another instance was i was working on a

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,799
specific uh feature

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,080
and it didn't work and it kept not

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,480
working and i knew

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,640
like i inherently knew it was working it

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
should be working

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,320
it wasn't until three or four days later

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
when i finally said something

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,279
to one of the engineers on the team and

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,279
they went oh that's a bug

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,600
and then i turned my screen off and i

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,799
went away and i took a very long walk so

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,080
i didn't say where is it i didn't need

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
to say out loud

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,200
and then i came back and i went why

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,080
didn't you tell me and it was

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
i didn't even think about it and so had

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,840
i mentioned

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,679
that i was having that particular issue

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,320
that would have saved an extra 48 hours

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,440
worth of time 48 72 hours worth of time

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,559
so communicate if you get stuck

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,039
there's a usually a community um some

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,760
places have discords for their support

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,120
like if you have an issue um and you you

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,799
want to talk to somebody about it

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,320
their community might have a discord um

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,600
they may have a subreddit and i know

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,960
what people think about reddit

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,440
credits treat reddit like public

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,360
tv change the channel if you don't like

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,559
it just go for what you know and walk

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,480
back out

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
um or they may have a dedicated slack

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,679
channel

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,080
or in our case at my company we also

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,240
have a discuss forum

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,919
which is where you can go specific to a

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,480
provider or a tool or something like

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,440
that

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,960
and people can respond ask for help you

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,559
are not the only one having whatever

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
issue it is that you're having

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,760
somebody had to go through it they may

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,200
not have called it the exact same thing

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,840
they made it out of phrase it the exact

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
same way

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,200
but if you can post that log and you can

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,559
you can post that issue

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,919
and let them know what's going on nine

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
times out of ten somebody will help i

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,080
will say 9.5 times out of 10.

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,679
somebody will say oh yeah i remember

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,720
that let me show you what you need to do

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,720
and then you move on but do not

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,480
not do anything yeah

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,399
don't just sit there and not do anything

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
um any contribution you have is

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,399
important

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,599
follow the rules follow the list heck

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,599
reach out on twitter

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,440
you'd be surprised how much twitter will

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,800
rally around people sometimes when they

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,280
know that they're new and they just

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,040
wanna

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,119
they just wanna succeed um i actually

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,960
didn't soapbox myself as much as i

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,679
thought i would so i have 10 more

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,399
minutes

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
um what i am going to do is say if you

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,599
all have

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
any questions any questions at all

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,079
please ask them you can ask me about my

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
experience

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,000
um as um

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,520
a software engineer because that's where

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,079
i started before i moved to developer

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,440
advocacy

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,079
you can ask me what it was like because

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,079
i actually came in as an apprentice

but no that is that's my talk

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
no one had any questions

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,880
if you end up thinking of something um

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,640
this particular notion

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,240
page will stay up um i am thinking about

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,760
switching to noticed or

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,520
spinning my website like website back up

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,720
um and so it may oh i have a question

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,040
all right i'll answer that in a second

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,400
so this if you don't see this info i

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,320
will put a

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
placeholder in here so you all will know

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,839
where to find the information on the top

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,440
on the tag okay all right

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,800
ruta i hope i'm saying that correctly i

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,200
will post the link again in chat

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,720
and amy had a question and so let's see

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,960
what that question was

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,000
uh thank you i appreciate that let's see

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,839
there are a bunch of cold school

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,040
learners from momentum in durham

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,320
what advice do you have for folks

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,720
starting out so when i first started out

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,440
um again i was going to women who code i

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,280
probably

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,720
could have claimed gas money for the

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,400
amount of mileage i drove all over

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,760
austin going to events until i figured

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,200
out what i wanted to do

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,520
so meetups are a good way to network um

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,880
when i was with women who code i found

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,079
myself drawn to ruby

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,960
i absolutely adored ruby and still do

00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
and we had a ruby tuesday meet up uh and

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
so

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,800
that was a good place to where we would

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,160
have people come and talk but then you

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,359
also had people that were working in

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,880
that same language that you work

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,880
shoulder to shoulder with i know that's

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,480
more difficult now that we're in the

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
in the pandemic times but in the before

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,000
times it was really helpful

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,680
the other thing that some people don't

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
know is that i did attend a code school

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,160
for a while

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,680
uh and you know

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,839
to be completely honest you want to tell

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,359
me i will tell you one thing

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,359
if i don't tell you anything else about

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,520
this particular question

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,000
get on twitter i have a job because of

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,440
twitter

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,640
i have a job because of two things

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,400
i was on twitter and i have i had a

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,079
person that i had recently met that

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,839
didn't mind fussing at me like they were

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,760
my auntie or my mother

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,200
and they made me apply because they knew

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,040
my background

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,880
i still to this day and i know a lot of

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,400
people like to say and i promise i'm not

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,839
making it political but a lot of people

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,800
like uh like to think that women

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,839
have bigger imposter syndrome imposter

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,079
syndrome is real

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,240
but i have an issue where i am extremely

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,480
literal about what i do and don't know

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,920
to my sometimes to my detriment this

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,040
person knew my background and said you

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,760
need to apply

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,119
when i applied i was able to dm the

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,320
person on twitter

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,400
i have found that more often than not a

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
lot of the job opportunities that i find

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
and that i share to people are from

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
twitter

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
the people that are posting said job

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,640
opportunities will open their dms

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,240
and you can ask them any questions you

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,760
want

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,040
the other thing i will say about people

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,960
that are in code school or just people

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,560
that are starting out in general

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,480
find the way you learn oh that's what i

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,920
for i apologize i forgot to add that

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,040
bullet in here

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,359
find the way you learn

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,800
i am very break fix i am very hands on i

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,200
need to break things down

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
and and and and to in order to figure

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,079
out how they work like

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,760
my brain works in examples in real world

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
examples not everybody works that way my

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,560
co-worker is a lot like me in that

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,240
if you give me a video if it's a 45

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,680
minute video three hours later we'll be

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,760
finishing it like we don't do

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,359
videos very well we are very project

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
based though because you get concrete

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,839
deliverables

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,040
um but we also like we're checklist kind

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,160
of people

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,839
um when i was learning go all that i

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,680
could find were go resources so the

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,680
learn go with test

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
that and exorcism were the two things

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
that finally got me on the track that i

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,079
needed to go and having an author of a

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
book that's actually

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,000
very receptive to feedback and questions

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,760
was amazing

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,760
so i would say yeah at the very top of

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,119
that list learn how you learn

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
not everybody's going to learn from a

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,599
video not everybody's going to learn

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,920
from a podcast

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,400
some people i have three notebooks

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,640
sitting up here right now

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,040
in addition to an entire library over

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,680
there of of physical books that i can

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,240
highlight

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,119
i do find myself using my ipad a lot now

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
um

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,400
for notes and drawing out things and

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,680
stuff um

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,280
and since i'm a checklist person notion

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,640
also works very well with me

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,680
um yeah the other thing don't be afraid

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,920
to ask questions

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,440
if you're if you are in a code school or

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
you are starting your journey

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,079
one you have no i want to say this and i

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,960
don't want to say it in a negative way

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,319
you have less of an excuse to not attend

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,680
a meet up than you used to have in the

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,800
before times because everything's

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,720
virtual

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,480
take advantage of those if you are here

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,640
today at this os 101

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,920
uh conference it's wonderful you've got

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,240
hands-on workshops you get to learn

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,960
about licensing you get to learn about

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,520
how to adjust that git commit in in two

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,040
steps

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,960
you know how hard it is for me to adjust

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,680
a gig commit i still have to google that

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,280
stuff like

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,160
all the time um so don't be afraid to

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,400
ask questions

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,839
you're nowhere near you're you're not

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,119
stupid period but you're definitely not

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,480
as stupid as you think you are

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,720
take that question throw some quotes

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,680
around it throw it into google

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,880
and go for it but don't be scared like

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,240
don't be scared to

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,040
to to walk up to people and

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
to virtually apologies virtually walk up

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,079
to people and ask them a question

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,920
because if you don't ask

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,440
you won't know and i'm to the point now

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
where i just i just ask

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,680
uh anybody that knows me will tell you

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,359
tracy will ask

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,200
she may be very literal when she does it

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,520
but she's gonna ask and

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,119
i take that and i try to i try to share

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,319
the wealth um i don't know if that

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,079
answered your question amy

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,359
if i need to go a little bit more into

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,839
it let me know

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,560
so we have about five minutes remaining

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,240
i do see

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,920
one additional question in the uh q a

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,960
interface oh yeah here we go let's see

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,400
thank you oh mathematics

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,599
uh let's see no worries

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,280
yeah i'm i'm you can any of you

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,640
ping me on twitter i don't mind i will

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,800
be absurdly honest with my feedback

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,680
i do have tact i promise you i possess

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,319
it uh

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,599
but i will absolutely try to give you a

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,720
solid answer

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,359
anytime that i can um you can also

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,359
um yeah you can try to add me on

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,040
linkedin i'm not huge on linkedin

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,480
twitter's probably the best way if my

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,480
dm's aren't open just

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,160
add me and i'll see it and then just say

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,839
hey tracy i need to ask you a question

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,400
or if you want to reference this you can

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,119
and let me know and i will do what i can

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,720
um but yeah if you can find a group i am

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,480
very big in women in linux

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,560
i absolutely love the community because

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,280
i do i have a sysadmin dev ops

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,119
background

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,160
but just being in that has opened me up

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,280
