Talk title: Building Communities That Don't Suck With Email 

Talk Abstract:
"Email marketing". I know, I know. When you hear it you think of inboxes packed full of junk. Well, email can be a valuable tool for building amazing open source communities and in this session, I will show you how.

I will cover the core elements of doing email well, what great content looks like, especially within the context of open source, how to set up a campaign, how to track open and click rates, and more. I will also show you what not to do: think of it as a protective layer to not be one of those annoying email marketers.

All of this will reduce friction for new community members, build growth, and hotrod your community to the next level.

yes welcome to my office

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,920
um i do not live on a boat um as many

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
people seem to think

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,759
so but it's wonderful to be here i've

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
got such a

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,800
soft spot for the whole ato crew and

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
todd and everybody who's involved and

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,240
everybody who's connected so

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
anytime i can play a role in what ato is

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
doing

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
in the events and beyond i'm always

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
happy to do so so yeah we're going to

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
talk about

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,079
building communities that don't suck

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
with email and i'm going to tell you a

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,559
little bit of a story as i go through

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
this

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,840
to kind of illustrate the journey that

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
i've been through and i'm hoping that

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
some of this will be useful for your

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
journey moving forward now before i go

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,360
on

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,960
i need to make something very very clear

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,280
i'm not an email expert

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
now you may be a bit disappointed that

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
this is slide number one

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,160
of the deck and this is a talk about

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,320
email

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,680
but i'm not an email expert i don't

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
profess to be

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
an email expert and um i think because

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
of that i've been able to go through a

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
journey that's been a little bit

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,920
different

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
to many people and i think i've actually

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
learned some things that

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,240
potentially could be even more valuable

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,400
now

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
as i mentioned when i was kind of

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
talking earlier on

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,920
i've i i've rejected email marketing as

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
a concept for many years and the reason

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,119
why is because i felt like email

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
marketing was done by people like this

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,759
right these really irritating marketing

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,520
gurus who are always blathering on about

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,320
how you can make ten thousand dollars a

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
day

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,479
with two hours worth of work if you go

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
through these five simple steps then

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
you'll be able to do this this and this

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
and this

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,479
and it's just so much junk and um

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,920
mauricio is uh the neighbor of this

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,960
individual who i'm not going to say his

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,240
name but this is actually a real

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
marketing guru

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,520
and your inbox is filled with all this

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
crap like you know just

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,200
beautiful looking emails like the one on

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,720
the left is from fleming steakhouse

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,159
and the one on the right is from newegg

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
right they don't actually give you

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
anything of any value

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
they just try it's just an ad that

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
designed to get you to click on

00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
something

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
so what happens is your inbox ends up

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,960
looking like this right this is

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
i first gave this presentation a couple

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
of months ago

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
and those of you who are eagle-eyed will

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,560
notice that i subscribe to both

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
joe biden and donald trump's email list

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
right and

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
i can if there's one thing you should

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,080
never do is subscribe to donald trump's

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
email list i'm not going to get

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,520
political about things but

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,959
wow just wow that's all you need to know

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
in terms of what they send out there

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,920
okay

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
um but we get all of this junk so what i

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,319
want to cover

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,760
in in this session is four

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
recommendations that i've learned that i

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
think

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,160
will be useful in not just sending all

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
of this junk out and actually sending

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
content that people really like

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,319
okay now the story goes back to when i

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
released this book called people powered

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,239
so this came out in november last year

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
i'm really proud of it it's been doing

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,120
pretty well but a year before that

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,040
i start i was i'd hired an agent i'd

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
built a proposal and i was going through

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
the act of kind of reaching out to

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,959
publishers now this is a business book

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
and um you know todd mentioned earlier

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480
on my other book the art of community

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
which is published by o'reilly so that's

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
the tech press is much easier to get a

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
book out like you can you can have a

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
conversation

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
with o'reilly a relatively short

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
proposal and then boom you've got an

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,040
agreement and you can build and you can

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,720
create your book with the business press

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,080
you have to go through an agent

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,239
and the proposal was like 38 pages long

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
it took six months to put the proposal

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
together it's a really involved process

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
and when i started talking to some of

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
these publishers they always ask the

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
same question which was how big is your

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
email list

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
and my response was this um email this

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,950
day

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,560
okay

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,400
[Music]

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
oh sorry i didn't hear that what what

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
how big is your email list

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
[Music]

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
sorry i didn't hear you the line must be

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
a bit scratchy jono how big is your

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,319
email list it's like we're

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,360
400. now

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,519
um what what i'd done is i'd put an

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
email opt-in box on my website a couple

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,519
of years previous

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
and just so people could sign up and get

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
email

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,920
and i was like okay um that should do it

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
and then i never really did anything

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
with it so people would sign up and

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
they'd never get emails from me which is

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
pretty much pointless and then um so i

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
kind of discounted this for for a long

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
time i i told them

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
they harper collins agreed to do a deal

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
with me to to kind of put um

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
uh people powered out but i had always

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,519
thought about the importance of this

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,199
email this thing

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,960
and then i was trying to um a guy who i

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
got to know who's a bit of a marketing

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
genius who shall remain nameless but for

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280
the sake of this argument it's going to

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,040
be nico mcbrain from iron maiden

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,720
and he said to me email's fine

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
people just suck at it that's the thing

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
you need to realize people really suck

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,199
at ebell

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
you get a lot of junk and i was thinking

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
that's really interesting that the

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
medium is probably valuable but we need

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
to take a different approach to how we

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
use it

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
okay so this is when the experiment

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
began so what i did

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
is uh and this is the actual data from

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
my um from my email

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
automation platform which is called

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,000
convertkit so back in march around the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
time that the pandemic was really

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
kicking off especially here in the u.s

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
i moved my 400 people from mailchimp

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
over to convertkit

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
and these are the people like i said

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
really done nothing with most of them

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
were

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
you know with email if you don't keep

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,400
emailing people then they go

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
they turn cold and then they never read

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,840
your emails so this was

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
frankly 400 people who were probably not

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,080
going to read my emails anywhere

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
anyway and then what happened between

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
then

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
and when i gave this first gave this

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
presentation which was in october last

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,039
year

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
um i grew to what about about 1600

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,520
emails

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
email subscribers something like that so

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
quite a lot of growth

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
and what i want to walk through is what

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,759
i did to kind of get that growth but

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
more importantly growth is one

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,199
metric of success but i think what's the

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
real metric is whether people are

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
actually reading and getting a lot of

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
value out of your emails

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,160
and there's three metrics that we need

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,720
to care about when it comes to this

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
so um oh i can see nancy's saying

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
consider a presentation on various ways

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
to publish a book online or hard copy

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,479
process

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
um i'd be more than happy to do a

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
session about that

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
if if there's interest by the way

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,800
because writing a textbook and write in

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,479
a business book like i say

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
and write in an ebook a very very

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
different processes so i think it's a

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160
great idea nancy

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
see anyway so this there's three kind of

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,440
um

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
metrics of success here the first one

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
which is not really metric of

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,680
success is how many emails you sent so

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
at the time that i first gave this

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,840
presentation i'd sent 37

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,600
824 emails now when it comes to

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,520
measuring email efficacy open rate

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
is how many people actually click on the

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
email in your in the inbox

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
and open it up okay so the the subject

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,919
is compelling enough

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
your reputation is compelling enough

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
that they're willing to actually click

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
an email

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
and most people don't click on emails

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
okay now the

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,240
industry standard recommendation for

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,560
what's good is about 23

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,479
now click rate is where you've got a

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
link in your email

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
um and you want someone to click on it

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
so it could go to your website could go

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
to a blog post it could go to a

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
special offer something you're selling

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
and then generally the average click

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,639
rate

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,319
that's good or industry standard is

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,160
about two to four percent so we'll go

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,759
with the four percent upper region

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
so when i first gave this presentation

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,800
back in october my

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,919
open rate was 39.20

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
and my average click rate was 7.55 which

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,800
is nearly double now if i load up

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,599
convertkit right now and just take a

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,080
quick look at where things stand today

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,520
my open rate today is 41.37 percent uh

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
which is nearly double

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
and then it's gone down a little bit and

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,039
click rate seven point four eight

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
percent

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
okay so without wishing to sound

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
braggadocious

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
i would argue that my emails are working

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,120
because the metrics are telling me that

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
it's significantly going above and

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,360
beyond industry standards so why is that

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,199
so the first recommendation here of four

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
share content people actually want right

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,759
this might seem obvious

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
but it's really important like how many

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
of you get emails like this

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
again it's just junk so when i started

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
thinking about this back in march

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
i was thinking okay what do i like to

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,440
read like what do i find interesting

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,680
um and i found a couple of examples one

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
is from an organization or from a guy

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
called ryan holliday

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
who wrote a bunch of books in stoicism

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,759
and he's got a newsletter called the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
daily stoic

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,160
and he sends just a stoicism is

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,039
essentially an ancient philosophy for

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
how to deal with

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,720
difficult challenges and how to kind of

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
build growth and i'm a big fan of it

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,199
big fan of stoicism it's not a religion

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,039
it's more of a way of thinking

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
but you can see this email look it's got

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,760
real content in there it doesn't tell

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,959
you to click on a link and go to some

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
random website

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,000
it's got links to other things that you

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
can go and find out about it's actually

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
valuable so i'd actually sit there and

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,080
click on them and think oh this is kind

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,320
of useful

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
another example is the email the

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
screenshots that you're seeing on the

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
screen here

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
are from an email service called

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,640
superhuman which i'm a big fan of love

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
it

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
and when you sign up to superhuman you

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
get these automated emails from the ceo

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
rahul vora

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,360
uh which walks through tips and tricks

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
and recommendations for how to use

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
superhuman and the features inside of it

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,200
so you can see here it tells me

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
you know how to do introductions really

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
quickly and that's actually a little

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,040
animated gif that you can see

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,640
in the middle of this screenshot um

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
ordinarily you'd see animating in your

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
email

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,680
and it shows you how to use that feature

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
within that tool okay so again it gives

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
me something practical that i can get

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
within my inbox

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
um so i started doing something similar

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
and these are some of the emails that i

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
started putting together the one on the

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
left is a podcasting quick start guide

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,680
you know i put together a 10 12 page

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,640
document for how to start a podcast

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,080
because i've been podcasting since 2004.

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
and sent that out the one on the right

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
is

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
is uh about how to get started building

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,519
a community and that little diagram in

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,880
there is from people-powered

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,560
okay so sending people real content okay

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,160
when i started experimenting with this i

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
started looking at the data

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,000
and you know within convertkit it shows

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,160
me the open rate and the click rate

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
um and as you can see you know these are

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,040
the industry

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
averages or the industry guidelines

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
twenty three percent four percent for

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,920
open and click rate you can see that

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
again these emails will get in

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,320
significantly higher rates now

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,000
um there were a couple of lower ones in

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
there like the salesforce one that would

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
tell me yeah well there's

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,839
nothing there's the the value the the

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
link in there is less valuable from than

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
some of the other links but i can learn

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
from this about what people like to

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
click on

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,600
okay all right now as todd mentioned if

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
you've got any questions feel free to

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
get them into the chat

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
as i go through this more than happy to

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
answer them

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,079
so second recommendation here don't

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,399
hassle people

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:39,920
now um how many of you

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,680
right i know i can't see you doing this

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
it doesn't matter put your hand up if

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
you use linkedin okay

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
put your hand up i know some of you

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
don't have your hands up right now

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
put your hand oh wow i can actually see

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
raised hand on

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
the zoom thing that's quite cool wow

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
you're actually putting your hands up

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
i've never seen that before

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,560
my other screen here is just covered in

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
it says you know blah blah's raised hand

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
so lots of you use linkedin okay i'm

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,560
gonna ask you another question

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,640
to ask you to put your hand up how many

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
of you get spammy

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
direct messages from people in linkedin

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
where they keep

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
messaging you even if you don't respond

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,680
asking you to

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,880
get on a call or buy their product to do

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
this particular thing how many of you

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,200
get those kinds of things okay

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,519
i can see loads of loads of hands coming

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
up now

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
this is really annoying okay this is an

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,880
example of one that i

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
i got right from some marketing

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,560
specialist i've i've blacked out

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,399
you know x-file style i've blacked out

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
the uh the the

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,079
the person to protect their privacy but

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
you know they said i saw your profile

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
thought i'd reach out we'll recently

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
launch

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,160
virtual sales blah blah um you know i

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
didn't respond thanks for connecting

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
jono

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
i'm always looking for ways to fuel your

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
pipeline would you be would you care to

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
chat

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,480
so the first one came in on july the

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,200
15th and then july

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
let me move my mouse july the 15th and

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
then

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,480
you know we had uh what is it july the

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,160
16th

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
uh no response and then a little while

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,279
later july the 21st and look how it kept

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,800
coming in

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,800
i didn't respond to any of these and i

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,639
actually just i didn't

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,639
kind of do you unfriend people or

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,160
deconnect people on linkedin

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,160
i um you know i uh i just

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
i i didn't unfriend them i guess you

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,800
could say because i wanted to see how

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,000
many more messages came in and lots more

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
messages came in

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
let us be very very very clear about

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
this this is spam

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
just because you accepted them as a

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,560
connection doesn't give them a right

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,720
to just spam you with junk okay so

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,079
you know that it's it's critical that we

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
don't just

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,680
not hassle them but we also don't

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,360
overwhelm them with information

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
so when we talk about overwhelming

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
people this is another example here

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
so i saw an ad on youtube for a book

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,680
that i thought was very interesting i

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,040
went and signed up to get a couple of

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,959
free chapters from the book

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,720
and then i received all of these emails

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
okay and look at look at the dates on

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
them

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
look how often almost every day

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
sometimes twice a day

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,000
i got emails from this guy okay it was

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
just ridiculous

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
so i sent him an e an email because i'm

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
very much of the viewpoint that

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,760
um people generally operate with good

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
intentions and i think one of the

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
biggest

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,360
um downsides of the current climate of

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
conversation that we have in the world

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
is that everybody looks at the words

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,600
that people say and very few people look

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
at the intent

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
behind the words and often the intent is

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
innocent

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,040
but the words that come out are

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
ill-advised and poorly chosen

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,000
so i sent them a note and i said you

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,480
know i just wanted to drop you a quick

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
low

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
quick note i love the spirit focus of

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,720
your work but this seems like overkill

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
you know all these emails email's a

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
powerful medium but it can be overdone

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,040
and if i were in your shoes i'd dial the

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
cadence back a bit i wouldn't want you

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,800
to overwhelm potential buyers

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,399
so just you know giving him some some

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,079
really practical feedback

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
and i got crickets oh sorry i'm english

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,160
uh

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,160
crickets okay it was no response

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
um and a lot of email marketers think

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
okay we've got to overwhelm people

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
that's just how you kind of get things

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,000
done so the way i do it right this is

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
again a screenshot

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
from my email platform i send out my

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
automated emails about once every four

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
days

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
i found that that's regular enough that

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
you can keep people engaged but not so

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
often that you're gonna annoy the heck

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,279
out of people

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
all right so let's now talk about

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,800
investing in your audience

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,959
so this is really really important

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
again how many of you get messages like

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,519
this right

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,360
now i love waves they're a company

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,920
israeli company that builds amazing

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,800
plugins for digital audio workstations

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
you know i'm

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,680
a musician i've got a band called baron

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
cart we've got our brand new first

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,639
release coming out actually in

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,760
a couple of weeks and they make digital

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,360
audio plugins um but this email is

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,279
junk right it doesn't tell me anything

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
it just says we've got

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,519
sneak peeks click here to go and find

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,600
out more it's a billboard ad

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,720
now the way i like to think about

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
anything but especially email

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,160
and this isn't an this is an analogy

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,199
that i i remember seeing

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,560
on some webinar and i i forget

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
my apologies to whoever came up with

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
this because i forget who who actually

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
did this but this wasn't i didn't invent

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
this

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,079
is that with content you want to think

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
of it like a piggy bank

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,600
right so if you've got a piggy bank

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,959
where you put the coins in you save the

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
coins and then you

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
empty the piggy bank and you can use the

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
coins to go and buy something

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
um the way in which you should look at

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
it is that you

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,199
you should fill the piggy bank up

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,880
regularly with value okay so you're

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,040
regularly putting

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
new material into the piggy bank and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,240
this is one of the reasons why when

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,880
people sign up for my email

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,120
i send them so many different things i

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,120
send them you know best practices and

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,160
recommendations free book chapters

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,720
access to free training special offers

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
um i ask you know if people have got

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,519
questions or concerns i respond to those

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
questions and concerns

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,600
i really want to build a relationship

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,839
with my audience okay

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,800
so if you keep investing amazing content

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
into your audience right they are gonna

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,320
think wow okay

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,839
um i'm getting a lot of value out of

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,519
this particular person who sent me this

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,120
material

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,199
then when you request something from

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,079
them if you ask them to buy a product or

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,120
to come to a webinar or you ask them to

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
create a bit of content for you if

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
you're building a community um then

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,320
they're much more likely to respond

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,639
to your ask than if you didn't invest so

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,759
much

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,680
into their in so much value into them

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
and i tend to think of it as an 80 20

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,600
rule

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
at least eight out of ten emails that

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,199
you send to people should be giving them

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,199
amazing value that they love

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
and if you send two in ten emails which

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
is asking them for something or

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,680
requesting something from them

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,240
then i think that's okay okay so

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,680
again don't send this kind of stuff send

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
this kind of stuff it's going to be much

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,480
more

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
valuable for your audience you're

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,759
investing in their success

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
you know i'll give you an example of

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,120
this it's happened actually uh towards

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,639
the tail end of last year

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
um um so actually middle middle of last

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
year

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
um i just dropped a note out to my

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,400
audience um

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
and i just said hey what's in your mind

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,280
right now you know

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,120
so i sent this to every single

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
subscriber that was that was on my list

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,880
back in july

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
um and it literally has there's no link

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
to click on just hit

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
reply um and i got a ton of responses

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,600
people

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,600
who were concerned about their jobs and

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,679
their careers they were wrestling with

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,960
their family issues they were

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,160
trying to learn how to build amazing

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
communities and were struggling with

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
some elements of this

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
and what i did is i went and responded

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
to a whole load of them

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,280
by just literally hitting replying and

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,280
sending a response back to them

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,480
and a lot of people replied to that and

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,720
said i never expected you to reply

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,080
you know like how many how many times

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,440
when you get an email like that

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,799
first of all we don't tend to get many

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
emails like that but how many times do

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,679
people actually

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
reply i think sometimes people don't

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
realize there's a human being on the end

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,600
of this and i think this is really

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,200
important jen says well i asks did you

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
promise reply to everyone did you reply

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,520
to everyone or just share

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,880
um i very explicitly did said that i'm

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
that i wasn't going to be able to reply

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
to everybody

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,039
but i think i replied to about 60 of

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
people who sent me

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,679
responses i basically just sat there for

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,799
a couple of hours and some of my

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
responses were

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,919
fairly short and some of them just sent

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
links to out to other material that

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,160
might be useful

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,520
but they got a personal reply um

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,080
what i also did is i used a service

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
called loom where

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,679
for me i i much prefer talking to a

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,799
camera than typing

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,480
um because i type like i'm you know

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
i'm just not good at typing i didn't do

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,880
mavis beacons typing

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
um remember that is that still around

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,720
maybe it's still around

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,720
um so i use the service called loom

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
where you can just record a video in

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,080
you know a very short video and then it

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
gives you a link and then you just send

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,200
them the link it's kind of like a

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
more efficient way of youtubing i guess

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
you could say so as you can see here

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
these are a bunch of examples where i

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
just go and respond to a bunch of people

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
and people love that as well

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,720
you know another example of building a

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
relationship with my audience

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,200
was um that i launched the people power

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,799
book club

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,880
this was actually an idea from a friend

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,960
of mine called monica

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,559
and another friend called bill and we

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
ran an 11 week

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,080
people power book club uh where people

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
read a chapter a week and then i did

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,200
like a q a session on the tuesdays we

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
did a study group session on the

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
thursdays

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,360
it was really fun and lots and lots of

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,960
people went and signed up for it

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,320
because again it's an investment in them

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
it's investment in giving them value

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
that's going to be useful to them didn't

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,679
charge for it

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,760
just a means of building a relationship

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,679
with my audience

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
and then um the final one i think this

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
is the the fourth one

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,520
is that to engage like a human being

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
again

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,120
i don't wish to keep railing on

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
fleming's and newegg but

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
this isn't how human beings talk to each

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,679
other right

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,559
this is how marketing weirdos

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,679
communicate to people okay nobody wants

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,720
this

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,960
and there'll be all kinds of

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
justification from plastic head

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
marketing consultants

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
that this is the way to do it uh but i'm

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,919
not talking about

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,320
clicks i'm not talking about about about

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,080
uh

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
revenue i'm talking about what human

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,320
beings want how people

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,240
like to engage okay these kinds of

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,360
emails are sent by this guy

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,080
right and um i don't think people want

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,919
that

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,919
what i wanted to figure out is what

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,720
kinds of emails should be sent by this

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,880
guy

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,960
right very different okay so

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,480
here's the thing this guy tends to use

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,000
um marketing hacks and tricks

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,120
to get to compel you into um

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,200
to compel you into

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,480
clicking on a link or buying a product

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
or something along those lines let me

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
give you an example

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
you know i went and searched in my inbox

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
for

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,200
jono my first name and

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,559
uh this is a common technique that

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,520
marketing guy uses is putting my first

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,280
name

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,640
into the subject line okay this is

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,240
something you can automate you can do it

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
in almost any automation marketing

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,760
automation platform

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,120
and um the logic

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,480
seems clear right people respond to

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,679
their first name if you're walking down

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
the street and someone shouts out your

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
first name you're probably going to turn

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,080
around

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
why don't we put that into the subject

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
line therefore

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,559
they're more likely to click on the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
subject line therefore you open up your

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,200
click rate

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
therefore you get a better level of

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,840
sorry open up your open rate

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
therefore you you might get a better

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
click rate because people are actually

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,440
seeing the material

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,120
that's the theory but the reality is

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,720
nobody no one on earth

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,320
sends an email to somebody and puts

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
their first name in the

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,080
subject line how many times have you

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,640
received an email from somebody

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,720
with your first name in the subject line

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,960
i can't think of one

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
time in my life when anyone's ever done

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
this to me

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
and i quite like this because plastic

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,600
head marketing guy

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
now i know that if i see any email with

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,320
my name in

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
the subject line it gets deleted i don't

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,640
even open it don't give them the

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,039
satisfaction of opening it okay it's

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,400
such a ridiculous prop

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,000
concept but it makes sense in marketing

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
circles where they kind of get together

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,720
and come up with all these tricks and

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,840
techniques

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,960
and and and my view is don't cheat the

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,000
person who's reading

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,880
your email give them actually good stuff

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
have a relationship with them talk like

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
a human being and then you'll get better

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
results

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
okay don't use these tricks and

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,320
techniques i just

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
they may work in the short term but

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
you're compromising short-term

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,600
results for long-term value and i think

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
we should always be looking at the long

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
term

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
you know i go back to something that

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
seth godin says seth godin

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
this is one of the most valuable things

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,880
i've ever read in my life

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,440
seth godin said if you're of service to

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,000
other people then other people

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
will do great things for you okay and

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,039
and i totally believe in that give

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
people amazing content invest in their

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,280
success

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
and then they're gonna be on your side

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,360
they're gonna be more likely to engage

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,280
with you

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,720
okay so there's some subtleties

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,039
i think in how we should do this and

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
this is inverting frankly a lot of the

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,919
marketing

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
theory that's out there so the first

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
thing is and this is this is a

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,520
typical kind of email that i would send

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
out first thing is have a normal subject

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
line

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
don't put loads of capital letters in

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,200
there people don't send emails where

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,240
they capitalize every single word you

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
most of the time

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,039
most people are sending emails that are

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,760
out pretty quickly so send a normal

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,559
subject line

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,240
no click bait don't use the word free

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
special offer this that and the other

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
gmail's going to catch all of that as in

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
their spam filter just send normal

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,720
subject email lines

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
second one i send emails from me the

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,200
johno johnnabacon.com is my real email

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,000
address it's my live email address

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,279
it doesn't go to my assistant um it goes

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,279
directly to me

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,720
and it's that's by design i want people

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,159
to be able to hit reply

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,240
and it comes straight through to me okay

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
and i say that actively in my emails

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
often the very first email you'll get

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,360
when you sign up for my email is

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
um you know i want to know what you're

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,159
working on or what you're concerned

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
about let's let me know

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,960
and then i can see and i'll try and

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,919
respond now again i try to set

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,720
expectations i can't respond to

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
everybody i get

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,679
hundreds of emails every day i can't

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,640
respond to everybody but i try to get

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,320
through a big chunk of them

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
the content's written personally it's

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
written like a human being

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,120
you know i don't like jargon and buzz

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
words and

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,880
i really don't like people who overuse

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,960
who overuse acronyms oh well i was

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,679
talking to the lt and the dri was saying

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,679
that we should be

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,960
talking to the eb and when the eb

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,240
learned about this then we needed to

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
check into the okr

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
and then from the okay okay we were able

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
to define the kpis like no

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,039
talk like a human being don't talk like

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,679
a robot reading a script okay

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
um we need to offer really practical

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,400
value

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,919
like put it in the email put value

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,440
inside of the email that's what people

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,360
actually want they don't want

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,039
to click on a link to go to a blog post

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
and i know why people do it right they

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,400
put links in the

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
emails to click on the click on the link

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
to take you to a website because the

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,200
website is going to be having a pixel

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,919
or google analytics on here and then

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,080
they can

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,200
then they can they can remark it towards

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,720
you they can

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
retarget you with advertising all those

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
kinds of things okay

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,039
uh i'm so reassured that looking at the

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,000
chat that you folks all agree with

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,960
with my ranting about marketing by the

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,559
way

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,400
i realized part way through some of this

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
i'm maybe coming across as a bit strong

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
so

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
thank you by the way it sounds like

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,039
we're all on the same page

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,840
all right and then plain text you know

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:46,320
i actually really um i really uh

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,840
experimented with this i i um

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
i started sending out emails that were

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,960
beautifully formatted

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
and my open rate and click weight went

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
down significantly especially the open

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
rate

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
and i think it's because if you've got

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,760
html content inside of emails

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,520
then uh gmail knows for example it's

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,880
probably going to be

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,799
junk and it'll put it in the promotions

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,279
folder or the updates folder or even in

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,080
the spam

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,919
in the spam folder so just plain text

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
emails just send them out yep they look

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,799
they

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
don't look very sexy but that's that's

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,960
cool

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
so um i just want to summarize this um

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
you know as we bring this into the

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,720
finish line so um tracking metrics

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,960
carefully

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,640
focus on open and click rate those are

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,799
the two most important ones

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,919
and look at those on a daily basis like

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,600
i like to open up

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,679
uh convertkit for example and look at my

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,120
email and say okay well

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
you know i'm getting the lower click

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,919
rate on this one why is that

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,840
you know to give you an example when i

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,760
started doing this i found out that when

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
i attached templates that went out to

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,440
people

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,120
that they could use to go through some a

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
task that i put in the email

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
um they got much higher click rates

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,799
because people like to receive things

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,559
via email

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,080
when i included embedded videos and

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,840
emails and it's not actually an embedded

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,360
video it's a picture of a video

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,279
that links off to youtube because you

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,679
can't embed videos in emails

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,880
um you got much lower click rates and i

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,159
learned well people just don't really

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
want to click on a video link

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,159
inside of an email so your metrics will

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,600
tell you what kind of content resonates

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,200
share content that people really want

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,360
send them things that you can help them

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
with think about who your audience is

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,679
um what they care about um

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,399
and what their pain is what they

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,960
struggle with and then

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,320
and then give them that give them a lot

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
give them a lot of that really valuable

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
material

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,760
don't hassle people don't send them

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,799
emails every day there's this one guy

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,159
um i'm

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,279
i'm just trying to think of who it was

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,720
actually i do remember who it was but

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,120
i'm not going to say his name

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,080
he was saying in some marketing class

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
about

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,440
selling people via email that you should

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,760
send them on the final day of a sales

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,919
campaign you should send them six emails

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
and that to me in one day and that to me

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,039
is just absolutely

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,480
ridiculous and again that might work in

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
terms of you may get some short-term

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
results some people will respond to that

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,880
but so many people are going to get

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
annoyed by that that you'll lose the

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,480
long-term value

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,880
don't compromise the long-term

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,320
relationship for the short-term results

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
um invest in your audience give them

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
great content like we've already talked

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,640
about and talk like a human being

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,559
don't use jargon and don't use junk

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,080
and don't inflate your results and all

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
this kind of stuff just really focus on

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,640
the right things and then the final

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
thing is you know have some some drink

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,679
some gin jin's good

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,000
it's good for the liver i'm not a doctor

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,960
don't take medical advice from me but

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,320
it should be good for the liver right um

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,000
mark says

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,440
that you've got some great gin for me

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,640
when i next come to

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,679
to nc i would i would love that um peter

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,520
is asking uh

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,760
gin straight no peter no only

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
only the great unwashed will drink gin

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,559
straight don't

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,240
it should be banned if if president

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,279
bacon became a thing which would be

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,520
awful

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,399
um i would i would ban two things i

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,159
would ban

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760
people who need to drink gin need

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,799
because it's it's an affront

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,240
against the humanity and anybody who

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,520
doesn't use their turn signal when

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,320
driving on a freeway

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720

um it's going to be at 10 am pacific um

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,120
and i'm going to walk through

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,320
how to build great content so we've

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,159
talked a lot about email

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,679
in this session but i'm going to broaden

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,320
that out and talk about

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,520
how to make amazing youtube videos and

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,840
uh blog posts

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
and run great webinars and all that kind

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,120
of stuff i'm going to walk through

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
a five-stage process that i've developed

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,000
over the course of my career

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,080
for how to put together a content

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,360
strategy how to make content that your

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,919
audience is going to love

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,039
and we focus on on the pain points

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,039
that's the key here is

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,880
don't focus on new things that your

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,799
audience can do learn what what they

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
what sucks about their life and focus on

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,080
how you can help it to suck less okay so

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,360
we'll be digging into that

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,720
i'm going to talk about which content

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
medium is going to be best for you some

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,919
recommendations for how you pick a

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,600
content medium that's right for you

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,840
um how to tune and optimize your

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,440
platforms so how do you make sure that

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,919
youtube is set up correctly how do you

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
set up

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,520
your blog correctly for example how to

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,880
put together an editorial calendar to

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,080
build a predictable flow of content

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
which is critical

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,679
um how to brainstorm topics ideas and

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,039
content brainstorm

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,760
you see this is what happens when you

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,760
add this slide in at the last minute

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,519
how to create compelling dynamic copying

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,960
content and a whole lot more

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,039
so i'm including this there's going to

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,159
be a downloadable editorial calendar

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,080
there's going to be a tips guide that

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,519
i'm going to send you via email a bunch

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
of additional training i'm going to send

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
you some free chapters from

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,640
people powered as well as the the

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,000
audiobook chapters

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,519
uh it's going to be a lot involved it's

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,279
completely free to go to so if you go to

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
johnnabacon.com

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,320
forward slash webinars for content i'd

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,519
appreciate if someone could pop that

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,720
link into the chat

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,000
so it's easier for people to click on um

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,159
and with that in mind thank you

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,159
uh samuel and with that in mind i am

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
done i'm going to stop sharing my screen

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,279
and let me know if you've got any

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,399
questions and then we'll dig in thank

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,480
you everybody

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,799
there's a couple of q and a's in the q a

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,880
box from evan which i think

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,640
we should probably quickly run through

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
the first one which i think is more for

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
you

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,559
todd is what is the cost of posting an

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,799
opening in open source jobs

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
yeah yeah well thank you evan um it's

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,720
free

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,720
it's it's uh free now again

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,399
it won't cost you a thing all you need

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,240
to do is create a very quick profile

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,919
uh only takes probably takes less than a

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,840
minute to do it we do ask for some very

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,559
basic information the cost of posting is

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,000
free

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,880
um we do you know monitor the site so

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,559
you know please don't i'll say abuse it

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,159
you know code of conduct applies and

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,080
things like that i know all that goes

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,760
without saying but it does bear

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,279
saying publicly because you know we're

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
very adamant when it comes to code of

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,440
conduct and

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,880
you know not abusing opportunities and

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,360
things like that i'm not in any way

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,720
implying that you would i know you won't

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,000
but anyway i do at least want to get

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
that out there but to answer your

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,840
question directly it's

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,279
entirely free won't cost you a thing and

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
what you'll see with open source jobs

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,919
coming up

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,279
is we'll engage in some expanded

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,039
marketing um

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,039
initiatives here very soon so you'll see

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,640
some open source job stuff come across

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,039
social media and across some other

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,480
platforms and ways of communicating here

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,279
very very soon so we're going to expand

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,880
the scope

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:54,559
of the job site soon but it's 100

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,640
free um okay there's two more from evan

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,720
as well which are for me um

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,399
so the first one is what tools do you

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,240
recommend to test emails

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,039
so they don't get flagged as spam so

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
um i'm gonna go back to not being a

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,159
marketing expert but i'm gonna tell you

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,440
what i've learned

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,960
the first thing is is don't you

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
there's there are certain kill words

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
that you shouldn't put into subject

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
lines in emails

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
um don't put the word free in a subject

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
line for example

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,600
or the word offer for example because

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,240
they tend to

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,279
they tend to trigger not necessarily a

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
spam filter but it'll put it in the

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,159
promotions and the updates tabs in gmail

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,679
the thing that is primarily going to

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,919
impact spam

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,840
is if you're sending huge swathes of

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,480
email that's getting a very very low

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,120
open rate and a very very low click rate

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,159
um so the deliverability of your email

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,799
is dependent

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,559
on um on your emails getting through

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,080
um and so you always want to make sure

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,840
that you can check within a lot of email

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,600
platforms what the deliverability rating

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,360
for an individual is

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,200
so if you don't want to get flagged as

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,480
spam the key thing is to make sure that

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,519
the right kind of people sign up for

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
your emails

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,640
so you're actually sending emails to

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,960
people who want it right you don't just

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
buy

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,639
like some people for example will buy

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
email lists and then start sending them

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,520
emails don't ever do that

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,800
because your deliverability will drop

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,159
through the floor because those people

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
don't want your emails they've been just

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,399
added to it

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,480
but the other thing is to make sure you

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,399
have a double opt-in now a double opt-in

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,839
is you've probably all seen this where

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,520
you sign up for an email you type your

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,960
email address into a box and then ask

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,079
you to confirm your email that's called

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,800
a double opt-in

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,800
now this is not legally required by for

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,320
example gdpr which regulates a lot of

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,079
online communication

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,280
but it's strongly recommended because a

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,919
lot of people may type their email

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,399
address in

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,520
or a bot may put an email address in

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,679
into into a

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,159
into a signup box and then you start

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,599
sending an email email and then

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,119
you know they don't read it so your

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,800
deliverability goes down so double

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,639
opt-ins are really important

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,919
um so that's what i would i would focus

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,280
on and then just make sure you're always

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,480
just testing the performance like

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
looking at the open in the click rate if

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,040
it gets too low

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,560
take the email out of rotation that's

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,599
what i would do um

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,920
and then the other question from evan is

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,240
um do you really think that after years

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
of operation that flemings and newegg

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,760
would use the tactic they do if it

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,000
doesn't work

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
how do you know it's unsuccessful beyond

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,680
i don't like it

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,960
well evan i think i mentioned in my

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,440
session

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,160
i don't know um it probably is

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
successful

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,520
i don't think any companies do things

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,160
because

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,079
um i i don't think they keep doing if it

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,599
didn't work to a degree

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,960
but this is to me the difference between

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,240
short-term and long-term rewards

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,480
there are many of these marketing

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
techniques that do work but the problem

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
i have with them

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
is that i think it annoys the audience

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,320
and what i want to focus on is

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,920
how do i build a really amazing

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
relationship with my audience that goes

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,119
beyond just the email

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,800
it's the email is one piece but it's the

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,320
webinars and it's the

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,920
training sessions and it's when you meet

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,839
people at conferences and when people

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
buy your books

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,280
to me the relationship is everything and

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,960
i want to make sure that when i'm

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,040
sending emails to people

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,480
that it's adding to that relation

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,960
relationship so

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,320
um you know i'm not suggesting for a

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,079
moment that the technique of sending

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,520
beautifully designed emails isn't going

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,720
to work it will work

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,280
what i'm saying is i think that it will

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,079
work but it will work in a very

00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,839
utilitarian

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,280
transactional manner as opposed to

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,480
really building a strong relationship

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,800
with with an audience but

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,640
you know you know this is wonderful

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:36,560
questions evan i appreciate it and i

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:36,560
