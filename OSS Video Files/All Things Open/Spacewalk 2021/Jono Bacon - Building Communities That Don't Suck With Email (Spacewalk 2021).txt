Talk title: Building Communities That Don't Suck With Email 

Talk Abstract:
"Email marketing". I know, I know. When you hear it you think of inboxes packed full of junk. Well, email can be a valuable tool for building amazing open source communities and in this session, I will show you how.

I will cover the core elements of doing email well, what great content looks like, especially within the context of open source, how to set up a campaign, how to track open and click rates, and more. I will also show you what not to do: think of it as a protective layer to not be one of those annoying email marketers.

All of this will reduce friction for new community members, build growth, and hotrod your community to the next level.
