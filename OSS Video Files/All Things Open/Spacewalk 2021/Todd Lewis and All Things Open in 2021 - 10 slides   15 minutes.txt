uh just a very very quick welcome so

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,599
welcome to

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,000
uh 2021 right so hello

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
uh i know that personally uh i'm hoping

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
that 2021's a little bit better than

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
2020.

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,920
uh 2020 was a rough year i think that's

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
pretty much an across-the-board

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
statement for everyone

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,800
i think it applies equally to pretty

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
much everyone lots of surprises in 2020

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
you don't need me to tell you that but

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
certainly for us

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
we spent the entire year iterating

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
adjusting

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
accommodating all these new things that

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
came up kind of popped up

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
don't say that we played whack-a-mole if

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
you're familiar with that game

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
but gosh 2020 sure felt like that at

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,800
times kind of putting out fires

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
learning new things and then just

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
generally learning how to navigate

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,200
around some obstacles that sort of

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
popped up so

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,559
however regardless of that you know our

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
mission in 2021 really remains the same

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,440
it hasn't changed at all you can read it

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,120
right here on this slide

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
and what we do is really we host

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
world-class open source educational

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
content

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
and we do that via conferences and

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
meetups and workshops and we really

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
prioritize

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
accessibility and then we also focus on

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
traditionally or historically

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
underrepresented organizations

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
as well something that we've done for

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,400
more than a decade now we have a 10-year

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
track record

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,759
we haven't done a perfect job every time

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
that's you know to be sure

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,520
no one's perfect us included but we've

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,640
done the best we can and we'd like to

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
think that we're getting better so we're

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,119
going to continue that

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,439
in 2021 uh the outlook uh q1 q2

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,960
uh i'll be honest with you q1 q2 i

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
believe and some of you might

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
um you know have i'm sure you have

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,799
differing opinions on this but in our

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,799
opinion

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
q1 q2 it's gonna you know there's still

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,600
going to gonna

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
there's gonna be a lot of turbulence the

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
turbulence is gonna stick around at

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,040
least for the first two quarters of this

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
year

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
it's gonna be a bit of a rough ride

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,720
however q3 q4 we think it's going to

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,640
start to smooth out a little bit

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
we think that vaccinations will be

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
better distributed

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
it'll get they'll get to more people and

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,520
hopefully our fingers are crossed that

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,680
those vaccinations will be effective

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,960
um and that they're done in a way again

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
that the end result

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
uh that we can begin to see some you

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
know return to some

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
some sense of normalcy we're hoping so

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
what does that mean for us

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,280
uh q1 q2 uh we're going to remain

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
virtual only for our events and this

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
applies directly to meetups and open

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,760
source 101 and i'll discuss those in

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
just a second

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,599
uh but by the time we get around to q3

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
q4 and that q3

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
um it really starts in july in our mind

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
it really starts right in the middle of

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
summer

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
the july uh august time frame uh we're

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,920
going to slowly return

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
to and start doing some things in person

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
that's at least the plan now that could

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
change

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,400
of course again it's you know the the

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
the pieces on the chess board are moving

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
quickly here

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,160
but we're trying to keep up and plan

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
accordingly but we do intend to get back

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
to some in person

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
uh beginning in july and august and

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
we're hoping that by all things open in

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
october

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
we'll take more of a hybrid approach

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
there will be an in-person component to

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
all things open

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,480
and then there will be a virtual

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,440
component or an element to all things

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,519
open as well

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
so we're planning for that for that

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,000
format right now again things could

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
change

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
but that's at least the way it's going

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,040
right now anyway uh our spring meetups

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
uh again i will i will

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400

again we're always open to suggestions

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
and ideas that you might have

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,400
um open source 101. uh we are going to

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,560
do it this year

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
this event had previously been scheduled

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
to be in person

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,599
in austin on march the 30th we are going

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
to move that to virtual now

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,519
so again given the covet situation we

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,239
really have no

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
no choice safety attendee safety is

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,720
always top of mind for us it's our first

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
priority

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
so that's certainly going to you know

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
that is going to stay the case it's

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,280
going to remain true

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
as we plan out our spring events again

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,400

and show people how they can get

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
involved and introduce you to some of

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,479
ato this year we'd love to hear from you

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,319
again that will officially open up in

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
early february so it'll be on

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
early to mid february uh so be on the

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
lookout for that cfp

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
and again questions again it's the same

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,919
email address we want to keep that

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,840
consistent info at all things open.org

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
open source jobs this is something we've

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
worked on for a while we've announced

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
this before but now we're really going

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
to focus on it

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
um why are we going to do a job site we

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
know that there are a lot of them out

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
there

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
but we've always wanted to do this

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
because open source is a little bit

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,199
different

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
we think open source requires some

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
knowledge and expertise

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,479
not just on the technology side but on

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,080
the process side so why are we doing it

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
two primary reasons because people want

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,919
to work in an open source environment we

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
talk to people consistently and they

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
want to work

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
in an environment that's supportive of

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
open source that allows

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
associates and colleagues to participate

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
and engage in open source in the open

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
source process

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
and then also companies need people with

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,280
those skills and experiences

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
point blank i mean companies are on the

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,800
lookout to hire people they're searching

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,160
for people with those skills

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
and what we want to do with this site is

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
bring those two groups together we

00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
really want to

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
bring again bring that together under

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,080
the umbrella of opensourcejobs.com

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,639
we do have a beta site that's open right

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
now so you can go and post jobs if

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
you're an employer if you're a company

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,800
or organization

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
and then if you're looking for jobs i

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
would encourage you to go to the site as

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
well

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
it's 100 free we're not looking to

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
monetize this

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
or anything like that at the moment you

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
know down the road we'll have to find a

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
way to

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
to monetize it to offset costs um but

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,199
again this is not you know no one's

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,720
looking to really build this into a

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,599
gigantic money maker we're really trying

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
to help people

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
and we view this as more of an extension

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
of what we do at in-person events which

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
is

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,360
which is really bring these two two

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
types of people and two types of groups

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
together

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
um uh one differentiator on here is that

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,560
if you post a job

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
and you want to do an interview with us

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,599
uh about the job itself

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,680
we will post a recording of you talking

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,599
about your job and explaining what

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,879
the open source component is why is it

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
open source what makes it a good

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,120
opportunity

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,440
we're actually going to couple those

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
recording uh those recordings with the

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
job posting itself so that someone

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
searching

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
will not only see the job not only see

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
the traditional details that they would

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
see on

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,039
more traditional job sites but then they

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
can actually look at and

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
and and actually sort of meet the person

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
virtually meet the person

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
that's doing the hiring or the

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
interviewing so that's something that's

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,240
just a little bit different there

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
open source score most of you are

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
familiar with this maybe some of you are

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,199
new to it

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
but you can go to

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,919
opensourcescore.org.org

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
what is it what does it do in short it's

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,080
just a tool it's more of an educational

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
tool and just a very quick survey

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
it's really designed as a way to gauge

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
open source experience and knowledge

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
and also the educational component of

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,959
this is for those of you taking the

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
survey

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,159
we're actually attempting to convey to

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,159
you

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
teach you show you what a lot of the

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
hiring managers are looking for

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
and even a lot of what of the open

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
source kind of core maintainers are

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
looking for

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
when you know they're looking for people

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
to contribute uh they're you know

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
they're looking for people with maybe

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,360
some experience

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
uh you know that maybe contributed to

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
open source projects in the past or

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
maybe have open sourced something

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
themselves

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
or are familiar with open source

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
licensing licenses or governance

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
policies

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,279
have attended some open source events

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,640
have just some general

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
knowledge maybe they have a github

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,160
account maybe you've been active on

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,000
github for a while those sorts of things

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,440
will certainly help you so it's our way

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
of trying to educate you and help you

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
out a little bit

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,160
once you take the survey um we then

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,000
uh generate a score for you and then we

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,839
tell you where you fall in relation to

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
everybody that's ever taken the score

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
so that's actually a pretty cool

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,080
component you'll kind of know where you

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,839
fall in relation to everybody

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
uh that has engaged with the survey

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,080
before right now that number is about

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,160
200 people

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
we've 200 people have taken this the

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
average score is 52

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,519
and as you might imagine about three

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
quarters have attended an open source

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
event

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
or a conference before that makes sense

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,240
because the majority of people that

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
learned about score

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,399
learned so or learned about it through

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
us at an event or at a conference but

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,800
anyway we look for that percentage to go

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
down

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
as the word gets out about the survey

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,440
and more people engage and actually take

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
it so i would encourage you to go over

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
to opensourcescore.org

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
and buzz through the survey it'll only

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
take you maybe two two minutes

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
um we are beginning to distribute a new

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,279
newsletter

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
it's called open source snapshot it's

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,079
going to be a monthly newsletter

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
in the very beginning but be on the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,800
lookout for that if you're a member of

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
our community if you've signed up for

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,240
our mailing list

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
you'll receive a newsletter you can

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,920
unsubscribe at any time we're not

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
looking to force anyone to receive

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
yet another newsletter from yet another

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,959
organization

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,800
but we are going to do our best to

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
include a lot of the research that we

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
engage in

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,959
i've talked extensively about this but a

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
lot of what we do the way a lot of our

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,160
time is spent

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,360
is actually on research it's reading

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,880
articles white papers watching videos

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,640
you know looking at even github

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
contributions and things like that as

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,440
much as we can

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959
to kind of learn who's active and what's

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
going on to kind of keep our finger on

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
the pulse of open source

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
again we gather a lot of data and gather

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,680
a lot of information so

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,279
this is our way of making a lot of that

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
information available to you

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
without you know while allowing you to

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
save a lot of time

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
and by you know not forcing you to go

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
out and do the research yourself again

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
our goal is to save you time and bring

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
you value

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,880
so be on the lookout for that we'll

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
focus on news and education and events

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
and jobs

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,200
and white papers and reports and things

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,959
like that and again

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
end goal to provide some educational

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,920
value to you um

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
we've had a lot of questions about this

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,200
you can actually go to

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,560
shop.allthingsopen.org

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
a lot of people are engaging in

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
e-commerce these days given the covid

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
situation

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,399
uh we have opened up a shopify store uh

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
this is something people have asked us

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,160
to do for a long long period of time

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
so many people that can't come to our

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,760
events they will send us an email or

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
contact us via social media

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
and they'll ping us and they'll ask

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
about hey is there a way that i can get

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
a t-shirt is there a way that i could

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,959
get a sticker or poster or things like

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
that

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,079
now you can and again this has been a

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
long time coming we should have done

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,639
this a long time ago

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,959
but you can go to shop.all things

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,560
open.org and actually see some of the

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
items that we have available

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,920
you'll see on the prices based on the

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
prices that you see again

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
that we're not looking to take advantage

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,920
of anybody i think everything is fairly

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,360
priced margins have been

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
um you know fairly calculated uh and

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240
again i don't think anybody will feel

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,279
taken advantage of when you take a look

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,040
at the prices

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,279

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
even want a shirt or a hat or a poster

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
or a sticker or anything we have to

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
