00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,649
like to introduce Jason hibbett who's

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,600
going to be taking us through a very

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,950
serious topic burnout but I think is

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,850
even more important that for us to be

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,350
able to recognize and respond to and the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,210
difficult times that we're in so with

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,210
that I'll turn it over to Jason thanks

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,920
Thank You Baker

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,840
I appreciate the introduction welcome

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,580
everyone I'm hoping that once we get

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,350
through some of the material today that

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,140
we'll have a great conversation here in

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,740
chat so I would encourage you to ask

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,299
questions and if if you have experiences

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,850
that you'd like to share and offer up

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,770
solutions to please jump right in

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,799
I don't have all the answers I just have

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,380
my experience so again my name is Jason

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,960
habits I seen your community architect

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,950
at Red Hat I work on our enable sysadmin

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,750
project so if we are at a live the live

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,970
show I would be at a booth with the sign

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,369
so yes we are looking for system

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,979
administrators to join our community of

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,670
writers I'm happy to address that later

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,189
on I've been a Red Hat for just over 17

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,140
years and most of you probably are if

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,460
you if you know me before are familiar

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,369
with my work around open-source comm and

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:03,689
I will turn off my phone to make sure I

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:07,550
don't get distracted great all right so

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,259
my story begins in 2017 spring of 2017

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,069
and I was mentally in a pretty bad spot

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,930
I was the

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:19,340
of just the perfect storm of stress

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,819
right the kind that nobody wants nobody

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,989
really asked for for me work was piling

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,999
up

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,560
it was piling up to a point where I

00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:31,519
couldn't process everything that was

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,829
expected of me I was training for some

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,180
spring half marathons which in a normal

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,730
situation probably would have been

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,019
stress relief however I was really

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,299
putting a lot of pressure under myself

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,459
to perform at a high level and then on

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:46,340
top of the everyday normal family

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,030
obligations our household had a surgery

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,769
that turned us into a one-car family and

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,780
for us that really seriously added to

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,219
the honor pressure on me to provide and

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:01,760
take care of the family and to basically

00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:03,260
be a chauffer for me and all the kids so

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
I finally reached a breaking point and

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,359
it wasn't just one thing it was a

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,150
culmination of things and what's

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,590
surprising for me is it I took it it hit

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,290
me completely from the blindside

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,000
I was totally caught off guard I never

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,280
thought I would be a victim of burnout I

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,859
was aware of burnout but I was more

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,169
concerned about how burnout might affect

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,199
members of the communities I'm involved

00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,799
with not me I thought I thought to

00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,069
myself

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,639
I'd never I've got this craziness stress

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,870
under control no problem but I remember

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,629
thinking that something was wrong and

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,079
that something was off I couldn't quite

00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:43,609
put my finger on it but upon reflection

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:47,659
you know it was there was something I

00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:50,120
just couldn't figure out in real time so

00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,569
I distinctly that remember the day when

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,459
I cried at work Jeff basically just

00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,949
crumbling under all the pressure I was

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,379
being put under i sat in my managers

00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,409
office and the faucets wouldn't stop it

00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:07,069
was it was a pretty bad moment of time

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,900
for me I was at a low point and the the

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,489
best thing is that my manager assured me

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,949
we would get through it and that they

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,840
wanted to help and and then I went home

00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,570
for the rest of the day I didn't open

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,810
the laptop I got some rest and I started

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,029
coming up with a plan and uh part of the

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,320
plan for me involved vacation so luckily

00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,789
I already had some vacation on the

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,900
calendar and that was my short-term

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,810
target was

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,600
zero in one day at a time get to that

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,669
vacation and when I finally went on

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,580
vacation I had spring break planned with

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,810
our family spent a week at the beach I

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,720
intentionally did not pack any

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,009
technology or work clothing or apparel

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,139
which severely limited my my packing if

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,639
any of you know how many textures are in

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,150
my wardrobe from all the conference's I

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,560
get to go to upon reflection I was

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,770
really pushing myself to exceed the

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,960
goals that my team and I could create

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,039
because I you know I want that feeling

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,660
that comes with having success at work

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,699
but this experience was different it

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,789
wasn't a healthy win it wasn't a healthy

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,380
win for Mike for me or my team but I

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:18,020
felt like I was letting everyone down

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,760
including myself when I look back I was

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,599
showing the signs of burnout I didn't

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,479
have much of an appetite

00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:25,669
I was tired all the time I was sleeping

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,729
in and it wasn't due to jet lag I was

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,010
doing things like working from the back

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,530
of my car while I was playing chauffeur

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,660
for all the family obligations I was

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,780
cleaning off my desk like I was about to

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,220
quit my job I was exercising but I

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,400
wasn't getting the endorphins in the

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,320
satisfaction that I was used to most

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,630
importantly I wasn't motivated to do the

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,970
work that I normally love to do I was

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,139
very blah about getting work done and I

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,120
was avoiding hanging out with people

00:05:51,139 --> 00:06:00,169
that I love so what did I do

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,580
I scheduled my annual physical and I

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,620
talked to my doctor about my situation

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,840
and they recommended that I see a

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,120
psychologist so I sat on the couch a few

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,340
weeks later and I talked things out and

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,310
I was eventually diagnosed with severe

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,770
anxiety which for me is close enough to

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,169
burnout to know that I didn't want to

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,789
feel the true effects of depression what

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,280
I mentioned previously are all the signs

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,320
of our signs of depression and Burnell a

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,000
lesson that I learned the hard way so

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,590
I'd like to share my experience with you

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,979
so that you can recognize the signs and

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,270
avoid going down this path some of the

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,760
tips and solutions I'm going to share

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,800
may not work for your situation they may

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,669
not work for kovat 19 times or post

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,610
Kovach 19

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:45,560
so your mileage may vary but I hope you

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,889
find them useful and I hope you're able

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,599
to modify them for your situation so

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:54,499
before we go on I must share that it is

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:57,080
perfectly okay to ask for help in fact I

00:06:54,499 --> 00:07:00,499
would highly encourage to ask a trusted

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,240
co-worker a friend a family member or a

00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,029
medical professional for any help or

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,449
guidance if you feel like you are going

00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:10,180
down the path of burnout or depression

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,250
we're all human and we could definitely

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,289
use a hand both in the ups and the downs

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,460
that we experience so we're talking

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,370
about passion for a minute because

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,050
there's a lot of passion and open source

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,849
and in technology from all the different

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,800
community members you know we push

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,419
ourselves to contribute to projects to

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,000
we join the community we sign up for

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,550
issues to work on and sometimes we take

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,509
on more than we can volunteer for so I

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,099
want to take a look at some of the

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:42,289
numbers in these are from 2018

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:45,379
now Gallup did a survey of 7500

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,210
full-time employees about bernal 23

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,300
percent of those workers said they felt

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,009
burned out more often than not it's 23

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,240
percent felt they were burned out more

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:57,919
often than not an additional 44 percent

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,610
reported feeling burned out sometimes so

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:06,500
that's a pretty big amount of people if

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:09,319
we just get down to the tech industry an

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,839
app called blind did a survey again in

00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,689
2018 and the statistics more than double

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,050
they surveyed 11,000 anonymous industry

00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:19,580
professionals and they found that 50%

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,330
reported that they are currently they

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,589
currently suffer from workplace burnout

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,180
again those numbers from 2018 but I

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,159
think it gives us an idea that you know

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,979
we're not alone out there is in this

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:35,510
burnout thing so let's just not be

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:37,370
another percentage talk about again talk

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,130
about passion passion means going above

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,019
and beyond but a word of caution passion

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,620
can actually lead to burnout and that

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:47,390
was probably partly my situation I was

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,130
willing to work the extra hours I signed

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,790
up for extra tasks I push myself to

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,560
perform and I still am but now the

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,410
important piece for me is I know the

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,060
trees of those extra efforts I know when

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,279
I can push hard and I know when I need

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:07,389
to say no but our work needs to be

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,579
balanced with three things recognition

00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:13,189
rewards and relaxation and I'll talk

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,079
more about this throughout the talk I

00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,610
encourage you to take your passion for

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,930
work and make it work for you but

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,970
balance it out with some of the tips I'm

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,990
going to share today it's important for

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,120
all of us to know the signs of burnout

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,410
to take measures to prevent burnout and

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,569
reduce stress and that's what we're

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:33,259
going to talk about lesson number one

00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:34,939
know is to know the signs of burnout

00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:37,129
it's pretty simple

00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:39,410
simply put burnout is a form of

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:41,360
depression where you're not motivated to

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,740
perform the things that are expected of

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,839
you at your job or in life it's not the

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,779
occasional slacking off like having

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,999
spring fever because the weather is nice

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,800
it's it's a it's a buildup of emotional

00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,259
stress or you just don't want to do

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,389
things that are asked of you sometimes

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:02,089
health care providers may refer to this

00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:04,100
as burnout as to refer to burnout as

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:07,850
compassion fatigue again we talked about

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,740
passion already but in 2019 the world's

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,949
health organization international

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,040
classification of diseases say that

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,839
twice as fast they actually added a new

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,720
diagnosis to finding chronic workplace

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,100
stress as burnout syndrome so I guess I

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,779
was a little ahead of the curve and was

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:29,959
diagnosed with burnout before Burnett

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:31,430
was actually a diagnosis all right there

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,709
are a number of factors that can lead to

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,269
burnout it could be too much work it

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,730
could be too much travel maybe not

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,569
during these times it could be unclear

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,240
expectations

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:43,399
it could be unreasonable deadlines it

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,769
could be a toxic culture or it could be

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,350
work life in balance just to name a few

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,319
I remember one thing that was extremely

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,029
abnormal for me mostly because I'm very

00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,829
social is that I actually started to

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,720
separate myself from my team activities

00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:00,079
and people that I would normally hang

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,429
out with so one example would be hey

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,949
Jason you want to go grab some lunch

00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,600
with us in the cafeteria and my response

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:07,110
at this time was nope I'm too busy I

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,140
have too much to do

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,450
or hey Jason Matt's in town do you want

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,060
to join us for happy hour nope I've got

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,589
way too much work to do and this is

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,089
totally unlike me and both of those

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,880
examples I would normally would have

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:25,890
said yes and wanted to be with my team

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,600
and to participate with them so some of

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,970
the research I did according to the Mayo

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,649
Clinic this is a list of questions that

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,839
you can ask yourself if you think you're

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,670
experiencing the symptoms of burnout I

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,529
won't read them all but you can see them

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,860
here on the screen you can ask things

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:42,269
like are you becoming cynical at work do

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,880
you lack energy to do things you

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:48,420
normally like to do are you using food

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,019
drugs or alcohol to feel better or to

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,540
not feel at all and finally have your

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,029
sleeping habits changed all of these can

00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,230
have an impact on your stress levels and

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:02,790
and can lead to burnout so I mentioned a

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,260
few of the symptoms above that I was

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,990
experiencing but let's get a bigger

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,790
picture of the symptoms of burnout

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,440
sometimes people get really ill you

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,579
might feel a loss of appetite or loss of

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,220
interest in the things that you normally

00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,620
like again I was feeling separation from

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,050
my team I was quote too busy to be

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,060
around them I personally wasn't sleeping

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,310
well I would stay up late I would sleep

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,100
in longer and ultimately this led to my

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,079
severe anxiety or in today's terms

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,930
burnout syndrome one thing to note

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,050
though it's very very difficult to self

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,269
diagnose burnout I know it because I

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,810
missed it right it like I said it caught

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:41,250
me by surprise so to combat that you and

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,720
your team and probably your family

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,140
should also know the signs of burnout

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,279
and hold each other accountable another

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,560
thing to mention here is that you should

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,269
also listen to your body if your body is

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,100
telling you no then you should probably

00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:55,709
take a step back and try to piece

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,990
together what's happening again I think

00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,399
in my situation I was kind of getting

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,810
there I knew something was off but I

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,209
didn't take the time to step back

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,320
because I was too concerned about all

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:08,970
the things that were in front of me that

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,140
I thought I had too needed to do the

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,519
second lesson like to share our

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,949
techniques on how to prevent burnout

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,050
first you need to take time away from

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:19,160
the job and plan time to unplug and

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,390
unwind this means planning vacations

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,050
maybe now at staycation

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,300
or other plan time away from work now in

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,420
fact I I'm actually gonna take this

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,970
Friday off it's my birthday so I can do

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,160
what I want but I just need a break I

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,230
need to leave the laptop down and need

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,170
to stop joining 500 resume calls a day

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,970
and I just want to unplug so I'm gonna

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,860
do it I'm recognizing that you know I

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,440
haven't had a day off since probably

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,510
mid-february

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,920
besides the weekends but I realize it

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,590
can be really hard to unplug with all

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,980
the pressures we have for our works and

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,900
and personal lives and so forth

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,340
in fact as I was putting together this

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,350
presentation I was joking with a

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,890
co-worker about we kind of came up with

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,650
this three levels of paid time off or

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,570
PTO and so the first one for me the best

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,000
way to unplug is to totally cut things

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,740
off like you don't log in you don't be

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,070
peeing in you don't check emails you

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,290
turn off notifications and and for me

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,140
like I'm in that situation and I'm and

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,940
I'm completely you know off the grid I'm

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,450
usually only opening my laptop for

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,260
personal use maybe that's you know

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,740
looking up a restaurant that we want to

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,210
go to on vacation or something like that

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,130
number two it's a kind of a decent way

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,840
to unplug but you're kind of like half

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,000
checked in right so you check into work

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,320
you're keeping your email going so that

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you don't have a mountain of email to

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,090
come back to but you're definitely not

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,550
as responsive as normal and then the

00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,380
third way just kind of like the you know

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,210
the crappy way to unplug it's like I'm

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,100
available if you need me I'll monitor

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:58,680
things but I'm not doing my normal

00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:00,600
office day-to-day things so depending on

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,490
your situation the various those three

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,420
different levels I just described

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,850
you can Rob Lee use them in a

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,260
combination but in my experience you'll

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,420
probably need at least two total

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,120
checkouts a year again that's no email

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,280
laptops down just try to unplug as much

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,600
as you can

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,300
I'd also like to mention that that

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,140
several times of the year for myself can

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,930
be busier than others

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,820
so having vacation having a vacation

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,380
plan and knowing when you have time to

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,740
relax and unplug is great for your

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,750
mental health for example I know that

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,520
like the springs and the fall time

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,020
periods are usually really busy for me

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,760
so while I may not be able to take

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,260
vacations during that time I definitely

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,420
have something to look forward to after

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,610
those after those busy times since 2017

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,430
I've actually taken three one-week

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,320
vacations to escape and unplug and it is

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,750
a wonderful feeling and I feel like a

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,620
much better in control and it's working

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,230
for me so your results may vary all

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,380
right number three it's easy really easy

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,610
nowadays to pconnect to 24/7 but being

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,300
connected all the time is really not

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,100
healthy for us so I'm hoping that one

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,550
that one thing us as humans can learn

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,010
from Koba 19 is let's just slow down I

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,830
don't know why we're in such a rush all

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,110
the time but let's just take it easy and

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,300
hopefully we can learn a big lesson here

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,710
from the stay at home and and those

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,330
situations that we have one way to avoid

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,580
being always on is to share what your

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,640
availability is so I find that my

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,020
calendar is a great tool for this but

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,900
there are special times when being more

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,640
specific about your schedule beyond

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,020
times and dates can be really handy so

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,400
for example if you're going to be out of

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,370
the office for a conference or an event

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,810
or on vacation communicate your time

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,820
constraints and your availability with

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,820
the people you work with in advance of

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,380
that time away so maybe about a week

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,030
ahead of time I might send an email to

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,560
my team that says hey I'm on vacation

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,330
next week if you need something for me

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,460
before then let me know this week

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,950
otherwise it's going to be after X date

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,260
before I can get back to you also let

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,630
them know if you're checking email phone

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,010
chat those type of things while you're

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:14,589
away so they you could set that

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,780
expectation if you're on vacation your

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,260
answer should be I am NOT checking any

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,790
messages until I get back in the office

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,360
use an autoresponder to help the

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,790
expectations to help share your schedule

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,300
and in that autoresponder provide other

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,950
contacts if someone needs assistance and

00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,840
guess while you're out so make sure you

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,710
line those up ahead of time and have

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,900
your backups understand what what

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,160
responsibilities they may need to help

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,800
back you up while you're out so that you

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
can actually enjoy a vacation a second

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,780
example I'd like to share is a best

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,460
practice from my team

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,990
that we take time part of me back up one

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,700
of the things my team recently did was

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,290
reinforce how we expect to communicate

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,640
so the the example here is look set

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,400
clear expectations of how you

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,470
communicate in real time asynchronously

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,990
and how how your meeting should be run

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,060
and in our current Koba 19:00 situation

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,740
my team agreed that if you need a

00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,390
response from someone that email is our

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,270
definitive answer or not chat or any

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,740
other ways of communication and I'm glad

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,770
that we were able to revisit that at the

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:27,240
beginning of our situation number 4

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,070
imposing limits and sharing them can

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,860
help you save time and prioritize things

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,320
in your life you can set limits around

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,060
the amount of time you research an issue

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,220
before you reach out for help you can

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,780
limit the time you spend on email you

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,420
can block time and your calendar to

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,370
avoid interruptions you can turn off

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,390
chat and email notifications to stop the

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,000
constant distractions

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,040
I was recently setting up a meeting and

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,130
I literally saw a block of time on a

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,350
call on my colleagues calendar that said

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:59,040
absolutely no meetings that was a very

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,320
clear warning to me of a very clear way

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,750
to set a limit and I wasn't going to

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,430
violate that and I looked for an ultra

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:10,500
meeting time for that situation all

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,840
right another example from my personal

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,610
experience is attending meetups in my

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,560
area where I live here in the Triangle

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,060
region of North Carolina we could

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,610
literally go to two to three meetups a

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,730
night throughout the week and sometimes

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,650
in the weekends so about the time when

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,050
my daughter was three and my son was

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,820
nine I realized that I wanted to be home

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,560
more in the evenings to see my kids I

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,240
didn't want to turn around ten years

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,920
later and see that my children are all

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,170
grown up but I met all these amazing

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,150
people at these meetups so I decided to

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,820
set a limit and my limit was that I

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,010
could attend to meetups per week so this

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,510
policy for myself made me prioritize

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,550
which meetups were important and

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,090
ultimately gave me more time with my

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,890
family

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,130
so I think I find a nice healthy balance

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,130
there

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,049
number five having a flexible work

00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:59,729
schedule can be key to address after

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,509
hours and all those extra things that

00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:05,309
come up so I know this one is probably

00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,629
many folks may not have the ability to

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,229
have a flexible work schedule but

00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:12,749
hopefully post koban 19 we will be more

00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:17,970
open to things like this I find it also

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:19,229
helpful for someone to I find it helpful

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,559
for someone like me to manage my pro

00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:23,999
ticket productivity excuse me I'm not

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,720
much of a morning person so I reserved

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:32,220
my mornings for exercise the exercise

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,869
helps me get my blood flowing helps me

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,899
prepare the for the day and it's a great

00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:38,399
stress reliever when approaching your

00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:41,159
schedule let your team know what your

00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:43,559
core hours are if something comes up

00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,679
maybe it's work or personal that impacts

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,840
your core hours communicate that change

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,129
with your team so for example I've got

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,629
to meet up tonight so I'm gonna be in

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:53,700
the office a little bit later than

00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,960
normal or I've got an appointment from

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,919
10:00 to 12:00 this morning and I will

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,559
not be available my team has a we use a

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,789
shared calendar with our remote or our

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:08,279
kind of non-core status updates to

00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,269
indicate when we're available I'm having

00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,609
that shared Carolyn has been really

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,340
working really great for our team and

00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:16,470
and really it's it helps address one of

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,090
the most important questions from my

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,859
team or maybe it not important but most

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,139
often asked question for my team which

00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:27,179
is where's Jason at today another

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:27,749
example if you have a late night code

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,309
push

00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:32,580
maybe you adjust your day to start later

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,109
or take off early on a future day my

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,179
team typically will do code code

00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,070
releases in the morning so when that

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,320
happens I shift my day around I get up a

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,210
little earlier I do the QA after the

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,710
code releases in production and then I

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,419
adjust my day making sure I don't give

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,029
up my me time which I'll talk about here

00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,529
shortly so as long as your team's note

00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,359
your team knows when you're available

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:54,269
and what you're working on they

00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,649
typically will respect your time now I

00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,419
know not everyone can have a flexible

00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,739
work schedule so I encourage you to find

00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,139
a ways to protect your mental health

00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:02,789
within your bounds maybe you can start a

00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:04,169
mental health interest group or

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,089
community of practice at your job

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:08,570
location or with your team or with your

00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,570
department

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,020
number six a little probably easier said

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,000
than done for most people so I'd like to

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,270
ask do you know where you spend your

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,520
time each day so we're gonna try to see

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,720
if we can use this chat functionality so

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,760
on a scale of one to five with one being

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,460
you don't know and five being you know

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,750
exactly how you spend your time if you

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,010
want to share in the chat please feel

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,140
free you know do you know how you spend

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,820
your time one through five are you

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,810
trapped in meetings are you spending

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:44,890
hours answering email so I have a great

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:46,420
exercise for you to try write down what

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,650
you spend your time doing for a week and

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:52,500
then take the time to analyze it figure

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,520
out where you can gain some efficiency

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,370
identify stressful things in your

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,590
schedule try to remove them tried to

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,070
reduce them or pair them with a stress

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,920
reliever and definitely block out time

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,600
for yourself for example if this was a

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,550
normal time period I would block out

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,650
every day from 8:30 to 9:30 because

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,630
that's when I help my daughter get ready

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,030
for school and onto the school bus and

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,280
then I do a workout I've actually

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,860
updated my schedule so that I'm now

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,650
checking in with the team between 9:00

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,610
9:30 and I'm doing my workout between

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:31,390
9:30 and 11:00 and that's my me time and

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,070
I saw a variety of numbers here so it

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,750
looks like for the most part we're

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,450
threes and fours and so we're pretty

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,580
good so anyone below that maybe take

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,400
some time to do some analysis of how

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,770
you're spending your time um there's a

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,360
lot of tools out there I think I see

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,640
someone in there that can help you track

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,120
your time and do things of that nature I

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,440
don't have any recommendations per se

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,700
the pen and paper works fine for what

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,830
does that have fine as well number seven

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,050
one of the worst abusers of how we spend

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:05,370
our time is unplanned work

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,420
I hate unplanned work right it's like

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,810
alright we'll do that we'll use the chat

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,730
again throw a +1 in the chat you know if

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,460
you agree and it may be a negative one

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,570
if you disagree that a unplanned work is

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,100
kind of one of the worst things in the

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:23,049
world so I did some research here pay

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,230
Judy conducted a study about unplanned

00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:28,990
work and they found that 70 percent or

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,570
more of technology staff are negatively

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,840
impacted by unplanned work in three or

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,600
more ways they the what they outlined

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,539
was include heightened stress and

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,289
anxiety reduced work-life balance and

00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:46,750
less time on important work so I've got

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,850
that stat here in front of me so I will

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,450
drop it in the chat for you just so you

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,690
can see that a little bit better my

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,299
advice would be and here's the link to

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:01,179
it my advice would be to find ways to

00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:03,429
convert or transform unplanned work into

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,650
play and work one of the ways I do this

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:13,990
so I hate trying to use my email as in

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:15,280
my inbox as a task list so I will take

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,390
something from email and put it into a

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,700
Trello board which I'll show an example

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:24,570
of next ask yourself you know how can

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,799
you automate something you know can you

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,190
can you look at your task us and see

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,140
what can be automated but I would also

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,640
caution you to avoid getting stuck in

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,669
the I followed a way to automate that

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,140
one day do the math find some time to

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,150
invest in something and automating

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,590
something you can to free up time for

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,730
your future self so yeah I kind of

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,039
alluded to this here one of the

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:51,429
techniques I used to get tasks out of my

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:54,370
inbox into Trello cards and this allows

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:59,620
me to you know keep my inbox very very

00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:01,570
open i i will typically ballpark it get

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,380
to inbox zero maybe once or twice a

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,390
month which is just a great feeling

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,760
another technique technique i use this

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,390
to compare to prepare what you can in

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:20,049
advance that means this will give you

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:25,780
more time to react to any fires or kind

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:27,940
of need to work on now kind of items so

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,780
for me when i'm doing any sort of things

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,520
around events like organizing meetups i

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,110
try to do as much planning ahead of time

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,030
and

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:39,480
so that could be things like getting

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,250
social media posts scheduled or ordering

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,570
the food you know a couple days ahead of

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,980
time because you'll kind of know what

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,900
the order is or at least have a process

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,670
to order the food so you're not ordering

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:52,200
pizza at the last minute again so those

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,490
are some things that help me to do

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,100
things in advance instead of in the

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,450
moment if you're in a team situation is

00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,460
there a way to share the pains of

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,990
unplanned work by rotating who's on call

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,070
and definitely document everything

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,500
documenting tasks so that each member of

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,000
your team can perform them and then

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,370
practice them and so we're actually

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,770
experiencing this right now the

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,350
open-source comm team is preparing for

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,390
our colleague Gen Y cougar to go on

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,090
maternity leave for her second child so

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,669
yay Jen and so they are documenting

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:26,630
things and they're right now taking turn

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:29,280
taking on different tasks throughout

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,450
that Jen would normally do while she's

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,160
still here in case they have any

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:41,160
questions and can fill up the

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:44,250
documentation okay number eight I now

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,340
like to share some effective ways to

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,320
effectively manage stress so you should

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,790
have some type of stress outlet it can

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,710
be a hobby it could be a sport an

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,990
activity that frees your mind from work

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,419
and other life demands if you work on

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:01,080
computers all day I might recommend that

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,540
you um unplug and do something offline I

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,950
know for a lot of coders they like to

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,169
code during the day and then code at

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:11,429
night so maybe they're working on

00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:13,770
different projects hopefully maybe using

00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,240
the chat people could share maybe what

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,559
some hobbies they're interested in and

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,390
maybe you can connect with others who

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,880
have the same hobbies as you and same

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,020
interest it could be activities like

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,299
painting photography hiking music really

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,660
reading anything that you do to find

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:32,730
relaxing my first go-to for stress

00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,190
management is exercise I'm totally

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,980
addicted to it I pretty much work out

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,100
every day but I like to mix it up I do

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,970
cardio I'll do weightlifting swimming

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,169
running cycling surfing I like to I mean

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,800
getting into some high-intensity

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:51,160
interval training here lately which is

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,290
been really really fun and these are all

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,880
staples in my exercise in fact last time

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,870
I gave a version of this talk I just did

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,430
the Pasadena triathlon sprint which was

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,010
really fun to get up in the morning and

00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,160
get that done and then go do a talk

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:08,920
about burnout so um I used to focus

00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,110
solely on running and I would run

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,430
typically you know three three half

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,040
marathons in the spring and three in the

00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,740
fall but really I switch to triathlons

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,960
and I just like the multidisciplinary of

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,940
the sport and its really just kind of a

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,200
little bit more joy to my life and like

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,080
getting out there on the bike let's see

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,730
alright still at number eight so it

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,710
might sound a little harsh but yeah you

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,150
can't help your team if you're you your

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,440
family's not in a good spot I think

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,110
we're definitely seeing that right now

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,030
with Koba 19 I like to use this analogy

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,520
from the pre-flight safety checklist

00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:46,240
that we all used to travel when we used

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,220
to travel you know quote in the event or

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,230
loss an event of loss of cabin pressure

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,720
and oxygen mask will drop down put your

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,140
mask on first before helping others and

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,510
so the point here is you know make time

00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,240
for yourself known as me time and

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,190
whether that means you know taking time

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,600
for meditation reading exercise your

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,310
favorite hobby you know take that take

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,560
the time to do that and avoid creating

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,110
and most importantly and I want to

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,180
stress this avoid creating a habit of

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,180
skipping your meet I'm in favor of work

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,780
in fact you should protect your me time

00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,400
above all other things that is you don't

00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,130
take anything else away today I would

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,600
HIGHLY encourage you to to protect your

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:30,280
me time alright number 9 another way to

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,320
reduce stress is to better manage your

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,990
time right time is our most precious

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,460
resource and we've got you get to choose

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,660
how you want to spend your time u.s.

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,340
minute with your family if you want to

00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,990
spend it at work on yourself

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,390
social that's really it's really up to

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,660
you find ways to work more efficiently

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,730
more effectively and make sure you put

00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,810
yourself first again you can't help

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,810
others if you're in a bad spot

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,750
so here are a few tips on how to improve

00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,370
time management again your results

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,919
results may vary depending on you how

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,429
you operate use a calendar to manage

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,690
your time and block off your meantime

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,630
protect blocks of time so that you can

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,980
actually get work done I typically will

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,559
like to schedule meetings back to back

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,380
so that I can get all my meetings out of

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,980
the way and then do the work later on or

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,690
you can another technique is to schedule

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,630
I'm a big fan of defaulting to 30-minute

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,309
meetings and maybe you block out the

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,200
whole hour so that you can take care of

00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:30,919
any action items after that 30-minute

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,270
meeting again analyze how you spend your

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,210
time and figure out where you can gain

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,669
some efficiencies and if and if you all

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,640
have ideas please feel free to share

00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:44,360
them in the chat about your how you

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,980
improve your time efficiency plan ahead

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,140
and use the to-do list it sounds really

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,669
simple but you'll be surprised how many

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,440
people don't do that

00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:55,010
start your day by doing the most

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,990
important tasks first don't waste time

00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,899
waiting I hate waiting it's the worst

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:04,070
thing so find ways to fill the waiting

00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:06,350
time you could use it for relaxation um

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,149
a lot of times you know just playing a

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,200
quick game while you're waiting can be a

00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:14,029
nice way to relieve stress

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,710
I've seen another way here is to batch

00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:18,110
similar items together to help your

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,520
brain having from switching years a lot

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,960
of times we refer to this as context

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,409
switching it's which is really hard to

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,809
do and really mentally draining it

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,429
lastly your learned how to delegate this

00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,440
can be really hard for a lot of people

00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:33,919
who are high achievers you just want to

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,070
do things but delegating can be a great

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,760
way to also share tasks with your team

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,620
so oh I won't play this video and I will

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,510
share the slides after this Deb

00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,270
Nicholson has a great talk called

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:50,570
delegating like a boss that if you need

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,539
help with delegation tips can be really

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,610
helpful for you alright number 10

00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:57,980
there's a really great article on open

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:02,690
source comm from Chris short on learning

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,129
the art of saying no the first

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,419
Rula saying though is to have an honest

00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:06,889
assessment of what your time

00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,249
availability is and what your interests

00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:09,679
are

00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:10,909
I mentioned interest because if you

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,159
don't really want to do something that's

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:16,489
being asked of you then don't do it

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:19,220
it's a I know sometimes we have to do

00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:21,470
things but maybe you push back a little

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,669
bit right spend time doing things that

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,309
draws out your passions and your

00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:27,200
interest the hard part about saying no

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:29,659
is that there is so much opportunity out

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,639
there whether you're working on a new

00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:33,889
project or traveling to new places can

00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:35,690
really seem exciting but being practical

00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:38,419
about your ability to participate and

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,639
put in the effort that you want in to be

00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:43,849
proud of could be a good filter to start

00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,169
with essentially let's using logic and

00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,450
reason instead of committing to

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,679
something based off of your emotion can

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,210
be really helpful Jen Krieger also has

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,609
some advice on another open-source comm

00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,710
article about avoiding burnout she

00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:00,889
created some rules around saying yes in

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,499
order to get better at saying no so she

00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:07,220
has some questions like this is it no or

00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:09,980
is it not right now is it no or is it

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,139
not the way you asked me to do it is it

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,349
no or can we do a little bit now and

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:17,450
then increment the rest later is it no

00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,710
or do we need a better defined goal so

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,010
that I can commit what I'm willing to

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,109
commit if it's yes how do I know I can

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:28,490
commit to the work so a great list there

00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:30,260
from from Jen Jen Krieger if you decide

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,789
to decline an opportunity you should

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,440
also have a graceful way of saying no

00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:37,819
for example you could respond to someone

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,889
saying normally I would jump all over

00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:41,720
this opportunity however I don't have

00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,450
the time right now to put in the effort

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,659
that I'd like and nine times out of ten

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:50,000
people will understand so as we wrap it

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,960
up here please please please don't

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,700
suffer in silence

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,289
whatever you do to approach burnout

00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,809
remember that you don't have to face it

00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:58,190
by yourself approach your manager talk

00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:01,039
to a trusted colleague talk to your

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,230
family get help before you go down the

00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,490
path to burnout and if you have a if you

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,950
think you're in a more serious case

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,390
please seek medical attention the good

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,880
news is if you do experience burnout

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,339
there hopefully will be a light at the

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,500
end of the tunnel for you once I figured

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:16,370
out what was wrong I was able to devise

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,340
a plan

00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,750
and recover mostly I found that time

00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,320
away from keyboard helped me in my

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,940
situation and while I still have intense

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,590
moments at work I'm much better equipped

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,060
to deal with them because of my

00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,100
experience and also because of the

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,930
support from my team so if you're in a

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,090
situation where you don't want I don't

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,520
have an advocate you can talk to at work

00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,770
or you're not getting the support you

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,390
need to put your mental health first you

00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,960
may have to face the fact that it may be

00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:47,360
assigned to consider a new job and get

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,410
your screen shots ready for the next

00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,800
slide this is what you've all been

00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:55,000
waiting for these are the top 10 things

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,580
that I just went over at a high level

00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,180
burnout can lead to fatigue excessive

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:04,940
stress sadness anger irritability

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,190
insomnia alcohol and substance abuse

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,160
heart disease and other medical

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,140
conditions so all these things are not

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,110
good for humans or for your teams at

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,600
work if you manage people or manage a

00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,550
team not only do you need to know and

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,650
understand the symptoms and signs of

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,290
burnout you need to be understanding and

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:27,110
supportive so please help those around

00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:30,230
you and and and under you to avoid

00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:32,630
burnout so be sure there's a link on

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,820
this page to check out the burnout index

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,790
it's a 10 question quiz you can take

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:41,750
anonymously and it will help you assess

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:43,100
your stress levels I hope that you can

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,870
use some of the tips I share today and

00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,360
put yourself first reduce stress and

00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,590
prevent burnout again I'll share the

00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,570
slides

00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,850
I've got linked to a lot of the

00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:55,070
resources I mentioned here in the

00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:58,280
presentation and we've got about 10

00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,770
minutes for Q&A again I probably saw

00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,590
some questions scroll by but I'm was not

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,260
able to address them real time so if you

00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,690
have a question let's queue them up and

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:16,790
also feel free everyone to jump in and

00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:18,380
help answer some questions I think I saw

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,810
a question earlier about how do you

00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,180
balance a stress reliever

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,920
so my idea there was if you know you're

00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,920
gonna have a stressful time on your

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,680
calendar or like an intense meeting or

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,480
an event maybe right afterwards you

00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,220
hey go get some ice cream or go for a

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,330
walk or I'm trying I'm trying to get

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,300
that balance where you've got this

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,230
influx of stress and anxiety and then

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,730
you want to balance that out with

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:48,950
something that can help take care of

00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:50,510
that question is have I ever read deep

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,830
work great book that mentions a lot of

00:37:50,510 --> 00:38:02,840
techniques yeah but I haven't read it

00:37:51,830 --> 00:38:07,070
but we can check it out let me go ahead

00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:14,570
and here's a link of the slides or a

00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:16,550
link to the link of the slides we have a

00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,440
question from Gregory do you have any

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,630
advice regarding burnout for someone who

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,950
is working full time but is also trying

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,480
to transition into a different career

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,050
path especially in the case where you

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:32,300
need to do both Wow

00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:33,680
yeah that's a tough one I mean you're

00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,750
probably in a situation where you have

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,340
to do both things and so I would I would

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,080
just probably recommend probably not a

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,960
great answer but figure out what's the

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,320
priority and and and use maybe you

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,820
prioritize different days and different

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,430
tasks for different days so that you can

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,990
balance it out but yeah that's a tough

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,700
situation particularly when you're on

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,490
the computer all day and I just noticed

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:02,090
during these times like I am on the

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,830
screen a lot more than I used to be so

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,750
sometimes I just want to I just go

00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:13,160
outside for a few minutes just to get

00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:14,839
away from the screen pages

00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,599
how can you tell if you're burnt out at

00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:22,220
work or no longer passionate about about

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,859
the position yeah you know I think it's

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,630
it comes down to like do you do it you

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:30,109
are are you emotionally invested in in

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,880
the work that you're doing you could

00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:34,099
take that little the link to the test

00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,009
there and use that as maybe a partial

00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,240
analysis but if you're in a in a

00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,710
situation where you're just like you

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,400
where you're like just don't feel like

00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,960
doing it or you're finding you probably

00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,269
procrastinating a little bit more than

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,039
you used to around a certain topic or

00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:52,039
certain work then that could be a

00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:55,099
definitely indicator of your your

00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:00,650
passion is fading for something another

00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:03,109
way page is to maybe ask for a a new a

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,849
small new project to work on and see if

00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,849
that you know maybe test the waters on

00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:09,859
something and maybe that could and maybe

00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:12,349
doesn't have to be work-related

00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:14,660
it could be something on a different

00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:17,240
open-source project or it could be just

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:26,280
a new hobby just to kind of test the

00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:28,490
waters all right let's see

00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,900
catching all these how do you stop

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,850
chosen stress-relieving activities from

00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,500
increasing your stress I end up having

00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:39,270
to troubleshoot and take on the

00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:40,470
leadership role yeah I mentioned that

00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,720
when I probably may have talked about

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,040
too quick but um maybe sharing that

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,930
leadership responsibility with other

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,630
people so that it's not you every time

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:52,800
that's also just kind of a good strategy

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:54,900
for to kind of build up other leadership

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,080
for whatever activities you're working

00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,850
on so you may have to do it in the short

00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,760
term and get before you get other people

00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:06,960
to volunteer but that's one way you

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,790
could potentially approach that any

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,350
recommendations for setting boundaries

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,360
and expectations with a management

00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:16,500
structure that is less than receptive to

00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,910
push back oh man first of all you may

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,560
want to find a copy of the open

00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:23,190
organization and leave a copy of that

00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,380
book on someone's desk or anonymously

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:29,100
mail that will maybe help them

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:32,670
understand give them opportunity to look

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,770
at different management structures but

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,590
this is kind of like Matthew for the the

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:41,010
saying know part which is really hard

00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,690
you know I think in my situation it was

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,160
like the analogy if you can pick a

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,570
picture a dump truck just behind it

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,670
backing up and just dumping more stuff

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,820
on you and I wasn't saying no I was just

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,630
saying yes I could do with us all so

00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,790
again I think this comes down to

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,260
priorities so you can talk with

00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,940
management and say hey look if you want

00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,940
me to do these new things and I need to

00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,130
take X Y & Z off my plate it's it's

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,590
sometimes not a great conversation to

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,150
have with management but they need to

00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,940
understand that we're all humans we can

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,130
only do so much and if they want you to

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,350
- they keep piling on then they've gotta

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,780
take stuff off as well

00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,430
hope that's helpful for you Isabelle is

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,420
asking how would you recommend bringing

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,680
up taking time off with your manager as

00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,810
someone's more junior I feel the

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,990
pressure to hard work yep I totally get

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,480
you I'm in a situation where our

00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,800
management is is very supportive I was

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,240
like I'm taking Friday off and they're

00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,430
like great you know you can say that you

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,859
went to this talk on burnout and that

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,019
they recommended taking time off

00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,749
and you can share the slide deck with

00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:46,759
them but really - I think kind of your

00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:47,690
real question is of us around you know

00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:50,779
kind of showing people that you're

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:53,269
getting work done and you know I'm so so

00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:56,150
fortunate to be in a situation where it

00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:57,739
doesn't matter where you are or how you

00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,309
get your work done as long as you get it

00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:05,839
done so hopefully if you if your team is

00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:07,789
can be more of a goal based team or find

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,130
ways to highlight some of the team

00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:12,499
achievements that could be that could

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:20,089
