Description: 
	Strategic Benefits of Contributing to Open Source: For businesses and individuals

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Tobie Langel, UnlockOpen

Abstract: The first open source practitioners were fueled by passion and a sense of purpose. As open source has both professionalized and become more mainstream, this has obviously changed. While the open source ethos and the desire to contribute to the commons may still be very much alive, there are also much more pragmatic considerations at play.

And that’s OK.

In this talk, we’ll look at how—both on an individual and organizational level—contributing to open source can be tied to career and business objectives while still being aligned with community values and culture. We’ll consider the positive impact that open source can have on individual careers, how this impact is still very unevenly distributed, and what important role employers can play to correct this. We’ll then dive into the more strategic benefits that building a strong open source culture can provide to corporations, and how what once appeared to be the realm of hackers, tinkerers, and activists can now also be a huge competitive advantage leveraged by companies of every size across all verticals.

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,580
well I think we can get started here

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,190
welcome to this session which is called

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,960
why contribute to open source and it's

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,090
about the strategic benefits of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,109
contributing to open source for both

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,060
individuals and organizations it's great

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,210
there's a chat on the right hand side

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,730
here so do feel free to ask questions

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,070
I'll keep an eye out and try to either

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,530
answer them as we go or save like the

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,780
the MOU meeting ones for the end but I'd

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:46,860
love for this to be as interactive as

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:50,570
possible so let me get started at the

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,370
beginning the original motivations

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,699
behind open source were very much

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,539
intrinsic ones people were scratching

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,190
their own inch itch and trying to solve

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,920
their own problems essentially and it

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,189
was very much a hobbyist in hacker

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,260
culture and you know I'm talking like

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,840
over two decades ago at this point right

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:19,439
and the focus was very much on building

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,119
tools for your own usage I think the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,369
story around the invention of free

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,150
software well the free software is a

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,900
concept ties into a driver for printer

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,799
and not working properly and so it's a

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,740
very sort of like self-serving wanting

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,530
to fix in having autonomy over our tools

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:46,250
kind of culture and in the sharing

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,210
aspects reputation was the real currency

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,090
and of course you had the community

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,939
aspects right now what's also worth

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,810
noting is practitioners were somewhat of

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,840
a homogeneous group back then very much

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:06,380
centered around a tech centers like

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,380
Silicon Valley very white very male etc

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,379
what changed in two decades or you know

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,800
close to that well a lot has well first

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,890
of all we

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,890
seen a massive growth of tech you've all

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,680
heard I'm sure the software is eating

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,500
the world mantra and you know it's

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,140
follow-up which is open source is eating

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,150
software which is eating the world and

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,630
so we've seen like a massive adoption of

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,930
tech everywhere right it's in you know

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,170
in in in machines and space and like

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,650
it's it has blown up and it's everywhere

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:47,000
and similarly we've seen following that

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:51,690
a massive adoption of open source and

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,840
obviously you know this has led to to a

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,110
number of changes and it's interesting

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,940
to actually look at the journey that

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:06,600
open source has taken as it sort of ate

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,460
its way into software this is a great

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:16,160
graph of that adapted from a slide by

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,510
any Theory off that sort of like walks

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,550
corporations through an open-source

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,310
journey but you know it's it's valid for

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,250
sort of like industry wise what happened

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,200
right it started with ignoring open

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:33,930
source for a long time then finally

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,670
corporations and you know other players

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,430
in the field started understanding that

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,220
it was actually a software that could be

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,770
used was that having to paint right free

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,570
as in gratis and so they started

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:52,860
consuming it as they started consuming

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,270
that software and building it into their

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,350
own software they were releasing what

00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,170
are the products that they were

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,739
releasing they had to start thinking

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:05,489
about a compliant compliance right and

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,680
bit by bit from compliance started

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,860
fixing upstream and contributing back to

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,080
software and finally sort of like only

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,049
recently and only for a subset of

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,120
players in the field moving to really

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,470
building a strong open-source culture we

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,680
know we can sort of translate these

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,949
different steps to in sort of layperson

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,349
language

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,729
the ignore step was well you know open

00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,259
sources for hippies we're doing real

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,860
business here so like we're not gonna

00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,800
look into this consuming was more like

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,389
yeah open sources free and let's use it

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,669
moving to compliance and that the

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,789
reaction was oh there's a license well

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,039
let's get a lawyer here and again moving

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,409
from a very sort of you know moving up

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:55,319
that that those step does that latter

00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:58,840
those steps again from a very sort of

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,759
consumerist perception of open source

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,069
you know contributing was while we're

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,680
essentially you know if we update that

00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,389
fix we don't have to maintain a fork so

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,180
it's like it's better for us like were

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,610
the ones benefiting right and even in

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,409
culture when when you move into adopting

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,830
sort of like the open source model as a

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:20,830
culture for example in was inner source

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,139
it's also like oh well it turns out that

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,330
building software the open source way is

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:29,800
actually pretty efficient so let's do

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:33,190
that do so it all of that is a very you

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,800
know centric self centric perception and

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,919
usage of open source right which is kind

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,560
of to be expected by corporations really

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:46,300
which are essentially there to you know

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,460
be profitable so let's try to map that

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,589
now into sort of the technology adoption

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,839
lifecycle right if you're not familiar

00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:56,199
was the small oh it's essentially a

00:05:52,839 --> 00:06:00,460
model what you you see how technology

00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,680
here open source is adopted for example

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,599
like in a given vertical in the industry

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,319
right so at first you have the

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:11,409
innovators on the 2.5 percent which are

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,379
actively working in the pneuma in them

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:18,849
in them in the new model and are really

00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:22,150
keen to see innovation and innovate um

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:25,900
quickly they will be followed by early

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,580
adopters which love new technology get

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,150
on board new technology really quickly

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,580
and then you'll have the early majority

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,229
and the late majority and finally the

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:40,330
laggards so if we go back to a graphic

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,780
think of those steps and think about the

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,660
difference

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,230
- one more consuming we see data today

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,419
that says that's the Austral report

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,800
that's a report from black duck which is

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:56,139
a company that audits software during

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,130
Rajan acquisitions and to see if there

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:01,510
are open source licenses to be accounted

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,830
for in the software that's being

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,700
purchased as part of the acquisition and

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,710
in 2019 so this is that was for the

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,720
financial services vertical but it's

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,060
sort of like similar numbers for every

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,030
vertical but there was open source

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,970
software and financial services a

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,000
hundred percent of acquisitions in 2019

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,580
and I think across industries it was 96

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,330
percent so basically that's like you

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,700
know it's it's beyond mainstream right

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:38,080
so you know you can use compliance as a

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:41,080
way to a proxy for actually being used

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,800
in products so today still in the

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,220
financial services industry there is 73

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,770
percent of companies are actually um you

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,750
know have set up systems to comply with

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:58,479
their open-source usage in products

00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:01,419
right and that is you know for over a

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,700
half it is like a common thing right so

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,950
again you know that level of like

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,039
understanding compliance in in the

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,910
industry is widely different from what

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:17,650
it was a few decades ago where companies

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:20,260
like Microsoft you know would call Linux

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,740
a cancer right whereas today there are

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,340
like huge proponents of open source so

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,020
you really see oh you know this this

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:33,120
change in perception and usage and

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,320
adoption of open source over those years

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,089
looking at contributing to open source

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,250
still in that financial services

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,190
vertical you'll see that well they're

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,540
like the we're very much in the sort of

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,120
like early adopters even you know half

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,100
of like early majority

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,020
kind of situation here right and that is

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,810
for financial services if we look in

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,000
tack right we said that number increases

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,340
quite a bit so tech companies well

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,910
obviously tend to contribute a lot more

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,070
to open-source mean but we're still at

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,170
this point far away from like this being

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,230
mainstream it is common but not as

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,380
mainstream okay but concretely you might

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,240
ask like what does this actually mean

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,070
and how does this help us to answer sort

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,590
of like Oh a key question here which is

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,080
well you know why should you contribute

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,030
to open source um

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,430
well what's important to understand

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,770
about all of this information is we in a

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,110
very different context today right as I

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,960
said software is now everywhere open

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,670
source is completely mainstream um it's

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,120
been widely adopted in use by

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,390
corporations again this is new right and

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,090
comparatively we have a much much much

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:53,450
bigger and a lot more diverse population

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:58,280
of developers right now and so as I see

00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:00,530
Todd in the hi Todd in the chat so we

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,820
have you know we're talking about

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,470
20-plus million developers today which

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,270
is growing right

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,890
and the other aspect also which i think

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,420
is a really interesting one and an

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,980
important one is that open source is

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,520
increasingly getting professionalized

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,650
right so for example and that's sort of

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,630
like an extreme example but this is not

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,050
uncommon across large open source

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:28,990
projects 93% of contributions to dollar

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:35,090
add to the Linux kernel and I think 20

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:37,670
2017 we're done by contributors who are

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,820
being paid to do that right so we are

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,370
very very far away it's a very very

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,480
distinct and different environment than

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:50,360
the early days of open source right and

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,780
hence this new context means new

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,090
additional motivations right people will

00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,400
not want to do open source and

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,680
corporations will not invest an open

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,420
source today for the same reasons that

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,540
they did before right

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,580
or not only for those reasons and what's

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,110
important is that you know this doesn't

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,959
end

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,079
date initial motivations it adds to them

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,990
and ants this new panel of reasons why

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,380
people may want to choose to invest an

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:23,529
open-source as a career move its etc um

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,209
and so it's important also to understand

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,040
that the initial motivations aren't

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:30,100
necessarily shared by everyone anymore

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,380
right um and not only is it important to

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,589
understand that but also to accept that

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,440
this is okay this is a normal thing that

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,430
happens when something moves from being

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,089
extremely niche in a very tight-knit

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,250
community that you know that is

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,720
heterogeneous and as it moves into

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,769
mainstream becomes a lot more

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:57,160
heterogeneous you will see that kind of

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:59,740
changes right um and lastly and I think

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,040
that's a really important thing is um we

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,500
can today because we understand better

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,399
the benefits of open source and how we

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:12,310
can benefit both individuals and

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:16,510
organizations we can be more intentional

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:20,079
about why we invest our time and our

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:24,970
sources um in open source right if we

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,100
understand the why we can you know

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,350
defend and make it it's easier to

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,050
justify actually the involvement and the

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,399
investment um in as a result and I think

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,410
that's particularly important right now

00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,140
it makes open source a lot more

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,350
sustainable right if you can articulate

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,600
the reason why as a developer or as an

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,610
organization you want to be invested in

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,220
open source you want to invest in it you

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,860
want to be involved it's way easier to

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,829
defend spending 20% of your time doing

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,170
that or you know up streaming that but

00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,240
that that fix that you that you did in

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:03,870
your fork or doing all of the related

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,490
work so let's dig into today's

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,170
motivations for both individuals and

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,010
organizations I'm gonna start with

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:18,060
individuals first um but to get us there

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:20,440
I want us to look at a funny graphic

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,640
process diagram that you've probably

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,820
seen on a t-shirt

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:31,330
we're in the past so this is a really

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,550
basic process diagram which basically

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,450
describes the input and output of an

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:40,240
engineer right as input cam problem and

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:43,680
coffee as output you have a solution and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,810
you get a byproduct which is so Kasim

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,450
yeah I'm seeing people laugh yes this is

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:54,520
very accurate I agree I love this

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:56,020
diagram so you know changing that from

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,580
an engineer to a software engineer

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:04,300
basically implies essentially you know

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,160
that the solution right becomes that

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:12,910
used to be just a solution like now is

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:16,390
more specific it's code and if we now

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,650
add a the pool of Commons to this

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,390
equation right basically where all of

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,410
well you know all open source software

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,150
is we see that this you know this

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,460
engineer starts contributing to that a

00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:33,130
pool of common instead right so so far

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,680
this is very similar to the original

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,320
diagram nothing much has changed what's

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,790
really interesting however is when a

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,520
second engineer shows up and also starts

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:53,890
contributing to the same pool of Commons

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:56,860
right they start having interactions in

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,770
those interactions can take many forms

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,120
you know they might start by just

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,490
someone might-- something just finding

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,180
an issue on github right

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,810
or maybe sending a pull request

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,790
reviewing a pull request right maybe

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,490
someone will then join a mailing list or

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,760
a chat and start having conversations

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,340
there and you know ask these

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,060
conversations evolve you all start to

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:28,720
see maybe things like mentoring coming

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,900
up and through events like this one or

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,510
you know other online events on

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,500
different times physical ones people

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,080
were sort to network

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,080
get connected to one another and sort of

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,900
like built this you know additional

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,260
layer of things happening on top of

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,420
their original strictly software

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,700
engineering work right and what's really

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,910
interesting and really important is that

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,070
contrary to what would happen if this

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,890
was to developers from the same company

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,380
contributing to the same codebase it is

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,260
very possible and oftentimes the case

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,270
that those two people interacting here

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,610
you know the multitude of people

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,100
interacting on a given piece of software

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,360
have extremely different motivations

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,420
come from extremely different

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,910
backgrounds will have really different

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,980
requirements from the same piece of

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,110
software have a different understanding

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,870
of technology maybe a different culture

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,270
maybe speak a different language um and

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,060
all of this is incredibly interesting

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:36,040
because it creates you know a slew of

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,990
different contexts and a use cases that

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,480
the original software engineer by

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:45,460
themselves could not have imagined or

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,580
throw it off so remember that I talked

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,070
about these you know that the sarcasm is

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,839
a byproduct right beforehand then of

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,630
course there was jokingly but it wasn't

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,550
only jokingly um all of this these

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,410
interactions all of you know the code

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,210
reviewing the mentoring the networking

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,040
all these interactions happening are

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:10,540
also themselves a vector of byproducts

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:14,880
right um and here's just like a number

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,880
of them right you know for example like

00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,970
leveling up engineers right I mean if

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,870
you participate to an open-source

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,060
project you will learn a lot from it

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,850
improving soft skills improving culture

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,710
adopting best practices better code

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,020
quality right oh there was like plenty

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,820
of those and what's interesting is that

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:39,550
we can actually sort of like group them

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:42,610
together um in a way that helps us think

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,370
about them in a more sort of practical

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,310
way that we can leverage better right um

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,910
and here we have um

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:55,550
four categories project level individual

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:59,840
level a team level and organizational

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:04,150
level byproducts of participating and

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,150
being part of this open-source culture

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm coming too

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm coming to the github on your resume

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,480
story

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,170
so let's seeing someone in the chat

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,370
mention that and yes I agree let's get

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:29,960
into the let's focus first on

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:32,330
individuals um and and yeah so I

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,550
mentioned leveling up engineers is a key

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,700
one here right and I think it's kind of

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,860
interesting why like you actually learn

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,020
from practicing with people that are

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,790
really good at the particular software

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,580
you're working on adopting best

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,550
practices improving soft skills this is

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,580
something that you get to do um in open

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,410
source really really well that is not

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,150
necessarily something that you get to do

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,460
at work and work when you have a problem

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,180
when you have a conflict was a co-worker

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,830
or a you know someone from a different

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,200
organization inside of your own company

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,180
it's really easy just to go talk to your

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,030
manager and get managers to fix the

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,430
problem right an open source you cannot

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,560
do that if someone's gatekeeping if

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,480
someone's in your way if someone's being

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,950
problematic or if you're the being the

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,580
problematic person because you know that

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,200
happens too right um you have to figure

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,850
how to fix that using soft skills

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,720
because there's you have no leverage

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:36,110
over this or other developer or engineer

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,660
that's working on this project of course

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:42,680
and as I mentioned you get access to an

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:46,160
expert network and you get better career

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,310
opportunities let's get into that open

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,440
source is a clear carrier booster like I

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,940
own my whole carrier to open source

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,250
right and a lot of other people do too

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,080
and you know as a me was saying on the

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,170
chat like your github profile is your

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,570
resume right um and so open source

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,620
is a great great way to kickstart and

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,990
level up your career

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,130
oh there's data around this from a

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:17,060
github survey where over half of the

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,940
respondents that we're open you know

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,680
working on open source software claimed

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,090
that open source was somewhat of very

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:29,300
important in getting the current role

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:36,530
right um but as you can imagine this

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:38,600
also comes was some issues and it you

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,090
know this system inherently favors

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,210
people that are privileged to be able to

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,790
spend time on open source outside of

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,240
their work right so I'll get to that

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:55,070
really shortly but before I want to

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,710
mention um two things that people some

00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:01,160
people in corporations actually

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:08,810
sometimes do um that was the hope of

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:13,100
taking a short career shortcut right is

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,750
to sort of like dress up their open

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,750
their resume was open source

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,150
contributions that are not like really

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,550
open source contributions and it's such

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:30,290
a common thing that companies that deal

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:34,910
was recruiting even handle this like

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:37,730
they know they look at github profiles

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:41,060
and they will know right away oh this is

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,370
a profile that was essentially built to

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,920
pretend that that the person has open

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,900
source contributions right so you have

00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,620
to commit to open source like it can't

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,500
be something that you do sort of like

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,740
just to get too short you know to

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,600
short-circuit your way to a better

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,000
position you really have to do it

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,740
seriously and the other aspect is also

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,990
you don't want to be opportunistic about

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:12,230
it there are companies in intact today

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,700
that will sort of send their junior

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,519
engineers to work on open source

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,009
projects was the hope that they were

00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:24,000
as a result get sort of like free

00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,769
education um and as soon as those you

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
know new recruits junior engineers are

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,149
sort of savvy enough to get their ways

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,850
around an open source project they're

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:35,850
then moved back into closed profiteering

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,070
stuff inside of the company right so I

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,929
mean obviously like word gets around

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,190
pretty quickly or practices like this

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:48,630
and it's never like it's it never pays

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:52,679
in the long run right so I want to now

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:56,309
address the problem of privilege in open

00:22:52,679 --> 00:23:03,120
source right basically in an image in a

00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:05,220
nutshell as as long as open source was

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,580
essentially something that people did as

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,490
a hobby it was outside of their job um

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:16,289
it was essentially something that people

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:19,019
that didn't have um that had the time to

00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,539
do that good right so you know typically

00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,750
care is something that is predominantly

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,419
done by women you find a lot of students

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,889
that have to work through their studies

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,809
to actually pay for their studies in

00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:33,600
their living right that didn't have the

00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:36,570
time and still don't have the time to be

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,990
able to spend time building an

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:44,669
open-source portfolio and so that

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,799
creates if you if you put that in and

00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:49,470
you add to that that open source really

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:53,789
is a carrier booster right so you can

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,610
you can see how this lack of access on

00:23:53,789 --> 00:24:01,289
the open source just for lack of time

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:03,480
right um Inc increases the discrepancy

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:07,350
and who gets the good jobs in open

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,980
source right um and you know tank is

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:15,600
sorry in tech in tech is already a field

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,909
where we have very clear yes there are

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,360
some data points on this I won't be able

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:26,850
to share them here but you know clearly

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:30,860
github survey shows that well first of

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:33,590
all open source is beneficial

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:38,240
to carry to your career right and

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:40,220
secondly that it's actually worse the

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,230
the divide is worse like I think like

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,200
there's roughly about 20% woman intact

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,210
for example um and I think an opensource

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,290
it's like three or five or something

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,270
like really really low and so actually I

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,370
wrote an article on this topic like a

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,730
while back I linked it in the chat later

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:02,540
on um so you know the question then

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:06,500
becomes if what can you do about this

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,970
and so what's interesting as companies

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,610
can actually really help and one of the

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,220
key way of helping is to professionalize

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:17,570
open source right the more people do

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,570
open source on their job the better

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:26,240
chances they have of participating in

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:28,130
the community and getting the benefiting

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,740
from it as a result right if you have a

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,800
stronger network if you've improved your

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,980
own skills this will get you in a better

00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,690
position secondly one of the things that

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,340
companies can do is proactively help on

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:45,650
the represented minorities contribute

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:48,770
right so make sure that everyone on your

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,200
team gets to contribute and not just the

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:55,270
people that are used to doing so right

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,010
because they will in general school to

00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:01,120
young white male for example right and

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:06,320
lastly you want to have their back right

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:09,470
um there's a lot of horrible stories and

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,740
open source about contribute contribute

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,170
terms being harassed for their gender

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,800
and for the race there's a lot those

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,470
data that shows for example that woman

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,680
contributing to open source when they're

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:29,510
using a female name tend to have their

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,610
code less merged into the main branches

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,780
then when they're using a male name so

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,220
you know there's a lot of data that

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:41,060
shows that like it is not the easiest

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,410
place for women and minorities right and

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,269
one of the really good things that you

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:49,070
can do here is invest in proper policy

00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:50,719
to protect your contributors one of the

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,669
things that I really like I think it's

00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:55,339
zalando who did that they actually wrote

00:26:52,669 --> 00:27:00,529
a link to that too actually

00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:06,080
there's zalando did a whole policy that

00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:08,989
basically creates a context in what

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,419
helps come their own employees who are

00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:14,959
being harassed or suffering a code of

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:18,139
conduct violations and external open

00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:20,029
source projects okay so I see like

00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,619
there's like so much like going on and

00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,019
chat about this I see that this is a hot

00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:25,549
topic so I hope we can actually like ask

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,700
you know discuss this a bit more at the

00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:31,009
end of them of them and the question is

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,349
what do companies actually get out of

00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:34,820
helping was this well um one of the

00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:36,499
really good things that they get out of

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,969
it is just like they increase diversity

00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:40,279
at every rung of the carrier ladder

00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:43,009
right if open source is a carrier

00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,829
booster then helping minorities get into

00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,899
open source will help them climb the

00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:49,849
career ladder and so you won't end up in

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:53,259
this situations where all of the

00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:55,729
diversity is in women junior members um

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,499
secondly well that's gonna help decrease

00:27:55,729 --> 00:28:03,349
the wage gap all of the wage gap is due

00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:06,469
to sorry I'm looking for the words here

00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:09,769
but basically it's due to the carrier

00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:14,539
ladder right better paid higher up jobs

00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:18,619
being essentially owned by well have

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:22,009
skewing towards white males right um and

00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:26,149
finally you know actually this just

00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:28,159
building the a structure for to make

00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:30,289
sure that everyone in your company can

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,190
and is encouraged to contribute to open

00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:36,349
source and there's help to do so will

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,469
build a stronger open source culture so

00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:42,379
that's a benefit to alright so now that

00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:44,269
we've sort of addressed the benefits for

00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:48,829
individuals I'd like to get into the

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:53,269
benefits for companies and organizations

00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:56,599
in general right there are three sort of

00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:58,410
like key benefits here on the first one

00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,780
is the ones that were look

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,870
before which is second order or

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,910
byproducts benefits right the second one

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,820
is operational benefits and lastly we

00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:12,930
have strategic benefits let's get into

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,630
second-order benefits so byproducts what

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,850
the Apache foundation calls community

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,500
over code it's just a concept that I

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:25,170
really really like so going back to the

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,510
Outback bark products and focusing now

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:30,510
on more on the team and organization

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:33,330
level right of course the project level

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,120
when you open source or project it tends

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,700
to create a whole bunch of benefits and

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,130
on documentation quality you know lower

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,980
technical depth etc right which are

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,460
essentially due to you like a forcing

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,500
function to actually do the work so

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:53,820
that's well documented what I understood

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:57,050
what is less so are the benefits of open

00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:02,580
source for teams and for organizations

00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:05,600
for teams what's interesting is how it

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:10,200
creates increased efficiencies for teams

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:13,170
so there is data from a research by

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,310
Frank nago for the Harvard Business

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:18,240
Review which is based on research they

00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,580
had that he wrote an article called

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,770
learning by contributing in 2017 um

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,250
where he analyzed

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,990
about 60 or 70 firms that were building

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,570
software on top of the Linux kernel

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,160
about half of which were actively

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:37,200
contributing to the Linux kernel and

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:39,930
half of which were not it turns out that

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,440
the companies that we're building on top

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:45,600
of the Linux kernel um we're um twice as

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:53,180
effective doing so they were producing

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:56,310
twice more value out of that work then

00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,930
those that were basically free writing

00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,510
on the work of others and what's

00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:03,270
fascinating is he actually goes Frank

00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:06,150
Nagel actually goes into the reason

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,470
behind this and that's why his article

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,140
is called learning in my contributing

00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,160
and he outlines to gee reasons right the

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,480
first obviously as the

00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,250
network that you built when you

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,040
contribute and when you think about it

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,780
if you're an open source practitioner if

00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,000
you've worked on a project you know the

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,400
people in a project right you know who

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,930
owns what point of the project you know

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,270
if and even if you don't you know how to

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:31,570
get to that person that person that

00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:35,020
person knows who you are and as a result

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,090
when you email them on a you know mid

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,510
day because you bumped into this weird

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,820
bug they will get back to you really

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,980
really quickly because they know you

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,540
they trust you they know that you've

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,650
done the you know the due diligence to

00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,890
make sure that the bug wasn't something

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:56,020
silly that you did and as a result you

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:57,880
can unlock a problematic situation was

00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,440
the software you're relying on way

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,290
faster because you know how to talk to

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,490
right um so you know typically this kind

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,160
of thing that would take someone that

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,040
doesn't know at all how the project work

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:14,190
marks maybe like a week dissolve as like

00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:20,620
an email and a half an hour of wait um

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:21,820
secondly the other aspect is that by

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,650
going through the process of

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,840
contributing and getting a code reviewed

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,990
what you're essentially doing right is

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,450
getting trained by the people that are

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,690
the best in the world on that software

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,550
right if you get the actual inventors of

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,260
a piece of software or like close

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,920
contributors um

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,960
look at your code and make you know

00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,400
suggest changes explained to you want

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,530
some of the decisions you make one the

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,010
right ones etc right so this is kind of

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,870
like being taught for free by the best

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,410
people in the world whose time you can't

00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,240
buy anyway and who are actually probably

00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,760
working on the clock of your own

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,870
company's competitive competition right

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,180
so it's this incredible way of actually

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:14,860
really improving the quality of your

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:16,570
team at the corporate level there's well

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,870
you know following up from that is

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:22,240
access to a talent pool right it's

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,570
common knowledge now in the industry in

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,160
a tech industry at least that getting

00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:31,570
having a really good open source culture

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:34,900
is key to getting to being attractive to

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:39,160
top engineering talent right and as a

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,110
data point at Facebook now a number of

00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,870
years ago probably seven to eight years

00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,460
ago at this point when Facebook wasn't

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:48,970
suffering at all from some of the

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,130
privacy issues that they had in the mean

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,740
time when it was still you know this hot

00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:58,030
startup in Silicon Valley that was going

00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:01,210
to IPO that was solving really

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,880
interesting engineering challenges new

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,700
recruits still for you know three

00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,000
quarters of new recruits still actually

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,430
had accepted their offer also because of

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,440
you know the of Facebook's open source

00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:18,100
program right so it was a key reason to

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,190
actually accept their offer so again you

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,570
know a very common benefit side benefit

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,480
of having a strong open source culture

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:28,240
right um and the last one I want to get

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,300
into as being perceived as an industry

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,470
leader which is also something that's

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,080
really common and as a result of getting

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,060
and involved in open source and I have a

00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,130
really sweet example of that which is

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,300
the company trivago trivago is a

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:48,190
European um company that is sort of like

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:53,110
a booking.com

00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:57,790
competitor it essentially and organizers

00:34:53,110 --> 00:35:00,510
traveling right and so a few years back

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:04,270
he was relying a lot on web pack um

00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:05,710
probably still is which is a library to

00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,800
sort of like handle all of your

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,380
front-end dependencies and they wanted

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,210
work to get to be improved my package is

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,600
an open source project and so they

00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,760
decided to sponsor the project to try to

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,350
get the one of the main maintainer x' to

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,570
actually implement the number of things

00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:24,610
that they want to do and so they gave I

00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,590
think a hundred thousand dollars over

00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,330
the course of a year to the project and

00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,250
so what's really interesting is not only

00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,130
that they get the work that they wanted

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,410
done and done at a quality level at

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,660
which they couldn't have a spy - and for

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,220
cost that was way under what they would

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,220
have had to pay for

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,349
had they had built that in-house trained

00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,390
someone at cetera right but what's

00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,460
really interesting is as a result of

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:51,160
this investment in the sponsoring of

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,260
that project they became perceived in

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,020
the front-end JavaScript community as a

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,820
friend of open-source in Europe and they

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,460
started to get lots of software

00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,950
engineers banging on the door was like

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,349
really good credentials asking for job

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,630
at their company right so that was you

00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:10,660
know a huge benefit for that company

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,760
that was completely unexpected all right

00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,700
let's get into operational benefits

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:20,650
quickly because we're running out of

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:23,800
time there a number a very common one

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:26,170
obviously is if that motivates companies

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,940
to get more involved in open source is

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,980
to start paying back technical depth

00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,980
maintaining Forks of software that you

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:36,099
catch every time there's a release as a

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,040
lot of work a lot of pain um doesn't

00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:41,320
always work the way it should and tends

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,580
to create security issues because you

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,820
can't you can't

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:48,040
[Music]

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,750
downstream patches as quickly as you

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,390
want because they conflict was yours um

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,500
and so you start delaying stuff you know

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:58,780
so it is a huge problem to have you're

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,750
much better off up streaming your

00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,480
software that creates a ton of benefit

00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,880
for you as a company but obviously for

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,970
the community that benefits from your

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,280
improvements another one there's

00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,140
economic incentives right the classic

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,040
story here is web browsers where you see

00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:21,730
that the level of complexity and the

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,250
size of browsers have essentially made

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,260
everyone move over the course of the

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:32,080
euros around the same codebase

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:33,460
um it would be extremely hard today to

00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,010
build a browser from scratch probably

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,470
completely impossible and meet all of

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:43,890
the requirements that you would have to

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:47,170
so relying on the existing software and

00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:49,030
contributing back to it is actually the

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:52,380
best way forward for a whole bunch of

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,380
companies operating in that space

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,010
um another really interesting aspect of

00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:05,869
another interesting benefit of open

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:08,869
source is that you can actually create a

00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:12,440
whole ecosystem when Facebook launched

00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:15,560
react it launched the main piece of

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,030
software react but also a number of

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,369
papers it's sort of like reference

00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,740
implementations for other pieces of

00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:23,510
software which were really quickly

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,690
picked on by other people in the

00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:29,210
community and built as separate projects

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,760
right and ended up being adopted by

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:35,060
react by Facebook because they were just

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,580
better right so that helped Facebook

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,930
sort of like this whole ecosystem that

00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,869
they could rely on they didn't have to

00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:45,280
build themselves and also obviously then

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:45,280
they started hiring from these projects

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:53,660
and I want to quickly get into strategic

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,690
benefits so if you've paid any attention

00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:02,960
to the car wars that are happening right

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:05,150
now you will see that cloud providers

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,970
are competing for developer Lang share

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:14,840
right and so one of the best ways to do

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:18,200
that is obviously to well showed about

00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,020
let developers use tools for free so

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,670
open source is a great way of doing that

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:27,950
show developers that you involved in the

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:31,700
community help developers it opens with

00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:33,950
developers in particular was their open

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,750
source projects and that's when you sort

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,940
do you realize why it made complete

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:41,270
sense for Microsoft to purchase github

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,810
for IBM to purchase Red Hat it's really

00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,400
all about getting this mind share

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,230
because once developers adopt a

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,550
technology because there was the

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,730
technology that they were running their

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:54,680
tests test Suites on for example for

00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,660
their open source projects they will

00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,520
know that technology better and tend to

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,320
adopt it at project you know the

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:06,170
projects that they do at work as well

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:09,259
right um another very common strategy to

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:15,890
is what's called monetizing your

00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:22,549
complement the idea here is that in when

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:25,849
you're building software all it's easier

00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:28,549
in a better position if what your

00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:32,150
software relies on itself is open-source

00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:35,269
right if you're building a service if

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:38,029
the service on which its if the solution

00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:39,980
is underneath is open source and not

00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:42,410
doesn't it's not owned by a single

00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,869
entity you're in a much better position

00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,789
not only because your market will be

00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:50,720
bigger but also because that entity

00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:53,480
cannot sort of suddenly don't take the

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,890
rug from underneath you so examples of

00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,489
that if you look at Google Google's

00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:02,390
focus is on search right and search is

00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:05,180
essentially a way like how search works

00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,950
from a financial perspective as you get

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,079
people to come and search and look at

00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,119
the ants and the ants pay for all of the

00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,289
work right so what you want is a

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,769
streamline way to bring people to

00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:21,460
actually search in the hands it's not

00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:24,499
surprising that Google invested both in

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:27,499
them you know an open source browser and

00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:30,440
an open source operating system because

00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:33,220
both of those make it really easy for

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,529
them to build on top of that

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:40,460
similarly Intel who is actually a chip

00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:42,259
manufacturer decided do I know the

00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,839
complement is the operating system right

00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:48,200
and so that's why Intel is the biggest

00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:50,630
contributor to Linux red hat which is

00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,839
essentially building services on top of

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:58,160
and selling services on top of Linux is

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,489
unsurprisingly the second biggest

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,200
contributor and the final example is an

00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:04,700
interesting one it's it's Facebook right

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,869
if you think about Facebook Facebook's

00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,150
job is essentially to data-mine

00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:14,869
information to then be able to target

00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:17,749
advertising right and the essential cost

00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:19,460
center that Facebook has as a result of

00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:22,460
that besides their work

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,860
force is their data centers and so what

00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,320
they Facebook do invested in a project

00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:30,560
called the Open Compute Project which is

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:36,050
essentially open a hardware not only for

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:39,470
servers themselves but also for data

00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,170
centers right um and by open sourcing in

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,370
providing all of this in factual

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,480
property for free

00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:51,620
it has leveled the field of companies

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:54,080
building hardware and so as a result cut

00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,090
down costs quite a bit I think like two

00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,440
or three years after Facebook's at that

00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:04,280
project they had already um saved two

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:08,320
billion dollars so billion was a be on

00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:11,630
operating costs and a few it was like a

00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:15,910
double-digit billion figure a few years

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:20,750
after so you know a massive cost saving

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:25,760
strategy by relying on open source and

00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:29,180
was that I'm at the end of this talk I

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,950
will share on the slides I think the

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:36,530
slides are already should already be up

00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:40,910
on that link and we have some time for

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:42,230
questions so let me get into they are up

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,480
okay wonderful cool

00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:50,210
I've also promised that I would be

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:54,350
sharing a few articles and they won't do

00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:56,120
that so let me sort of like scroll back

00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:02,110
up and the questions I saw like lots of

00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:05,289
activity around this so going back to

00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,289
[Music]

00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:17,840
yes so Debbie mentioned that you know on

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:21,430
the github is your profile aspect that

00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,540
not only do come please do that but

00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:26,570
companies also review a whole bunch of

00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,310
other things or at least like her

00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,990
company does which i think is great in

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,500
which I hope I would hope more companies

00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,500
of dead

00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:39,710
and in and yes like the fact that github

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:43,310
is your resume is not necessarily a good

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:45,890
thing it has issues as I mentioned right

00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,350
but it is nonetheless of fact so it's

00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,060
something that as a practitioner you

00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,860
want to consider is in answer you know a

00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:55,790
job seeker this is something that's

00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:59,890
important that you want to consider so

00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,890
there were questions around

00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,990
data points on the privilege issues that

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,020
I just mentioned right now again I won't

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:14,570
share what I have in this chat as soon

00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:19,130
as I find the article on this topic yes

00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:20,990
again mentioning that open source is

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,570
more than just direct contributions to

00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:26,060
code a hundred percent right I actually

00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:29,630
started my career in open source by

00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:32,120
documenting an open source JavaScript

00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,950
library that I was using and that's how

00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,870
I learned to code right I wanted to use

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,460
that thing and I looked at the code and

00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,860
that's how I learned how code worked and

00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,600
so you know it was incredibly valuable

00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,110
to me it was incredibly valuable to the

00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:48,140
project and it was a great start to my

00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:50,480
career so you know absolutely code is

00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,920
not the only thing and documentation is

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,600
one but there are lots of others right

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,060
now managing the community is another

00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:04,610
marketing I mean you have plenty of ways

00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:08,870
that you can contribute to projects yes

00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:12,740
some people mentioning that it's it's

00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:17,870
sort of like a shame that sexism is a

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:21,680
thing I'm sorry to this sort of word it

00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:25,190
that way but yes it is extremely

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,660
unfortunate but it is a reality of well

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,000
you know the world we live in in general

00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:32,060
but tech in particular and at least we

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,210
can try to do something here so again I

00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,850
insist on the benefits for companies of

00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,570
making sure net if they're building an

00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:44,150
open-source culture and want their

00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:46,799
engineers to contribute making sure that

00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,599
all of them get to do that

00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:55,890
all of them feel safe doing so it is

00:46:48,599 --> 00:47:01,259
super important yeah some people bring

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:05,039
AG ISM up I mean this is an issue both

00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:08,279
for older developers but also for

00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:12,119
younger ones right that are not taken

00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:14,549
seriously all the developers tend to see

00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:18,269
their pay the crease as they age unless

00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:19,769
they take more managerial tracks which

00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:29,069
is not the case everywhere but you know

00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:31,949
it happens this is also a concern um a

00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:34,079
me bringing up the fact that companies

00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,880
need to know their requires a lot of

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,459
effort to contribute to open source yes

00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:46,170
there was no free lunch rate but there

00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:48,839
are huge benefits out of it you know

00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:53,489
mentioning I think trivago contributing

00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:55,829
to funding other open source efforts and

00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:58,170
that they still do yes trivago actually

00:47:55,829 --> 00:48:03,630
not only it's really interesting not

00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:05,099
only do they continue to fund other

00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,959
efforts but they actually have their own

00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,309
or had that we I don't know you know

00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:09,929
like everything is sort of upside down

00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:12,839
now so it's kind of wait to talk about

00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:15,599
this but they have their own open source

00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:17,039
conference so they found so much value

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:30,239
in it that they really decided to Double

00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:33,660
Down Thank You Josh I hope this helps

00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:38,369
this helped you can look at some of my

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:39,719
other talks make the argument more

00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:41,910
clearly for the business case of a

00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,679
bronze horse oh there's like some

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:47,449
overlap was this talk but I think this

00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,449
this could help

00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:53,769
yeah Debbie brings up the fact that open

00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,150
source doesn't mean necessarily

00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:58,099
supported and maintained or has a great

00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:03,200
community right so this is also

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:04,849
something that's a skill that you sort

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,859
of like learn when you start using

00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,750
relying on open source as an engineer is

00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:11,210
to figure out well well the open source

00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:20,930
project that I want to rely on now be

00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:23,000
around in two or three years yes more we

00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:27,559
know more comments about community being

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,400
important of course like you know as the

00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:34,970
Apache sort of like tagline community of

00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,599
a code right I think that's that's

00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:40,970
critical um I don't know if you might

00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:46,700
have you might have been aware a while

00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:49,549
ago github decided to storm sort of like

00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,069
a copy of all of the represent Ruiz and

00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:53,829
like a vault like somewhere and the

00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:56,630
Arctic sea or something like that

00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:57,980
and I mean of course that was like a PR

00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,359
stunt right and everybody talked about

00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,970
it and it was a great pure stance in

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,730
people you know and it sure but what's

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:07,339
what I thought was you know sending the

00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:10,549
really wrong message is like that code

00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:12,440
by itself like even in two years it's

00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,519
probably like pretty hard to use it

00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,730
probably doesn't make a lot more sense

00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:19,160
right however the communities behind

00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:22,640
that code could probably be bomb a lot

00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:26,450
of this in a short amount of time so I

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,339
feel like there's there's we don't

00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:31,339
insist on the community aspect of

00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:35,690
open-source enough like clearly it's

00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:38,829
it's at the center it's the key to this

00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:41,630
practice and which is you know I think

00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:44,089
it really shows when you look at them

00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:48,200
you know the diagram around byproducts

00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:50,900
like all of those byproducts that are

00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,509
highly valuable only the effect of the

00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:56,869
community aspect of working on code

00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:59,589
together right um and so that's

00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:02,390
absolutely fundamental um

00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,280
and

00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,920
you know if you have to like if there's

00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:13,940
one key takeaway of why you should do

00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:15,530
open source it's because community you

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:20,330
know the culture and the community of

00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:24,340
open source are like you know that's

00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,340
where the real value lies right

00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:37,430
so I'm looking back at the chance and no

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:41,720
comments there so Debbie mentions being

00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:43,520
round up org slash community which I'm

00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,030
not familiar with so I'll go check that

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:52,690
out

00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:52,690
Oh Rob asks a really good question about

00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:02,050
community for real for much smaller

00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:05,090
projects well the community is not only

00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:08,300
the people contributing to the software

00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:10,910
it's broader than that it's also the

00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,010
people using the software the benefit of

00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,810
really small communities was really

00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,500
small you know it's a software that

00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:21,590
addresses a niche is that you can build

00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,420
sort of like a really product like an

00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:26,450
really close relationship with the

00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:32,000
people actually using the software and

00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:34,930
and that can be really rewarding so Rob

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:41,590
my answer to your question would be um

00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:44,360
not to focus on on community is only

00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:48,620
about the contributors but being broader

00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:53,030
right and in you know some projects will

00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:56,090
have users of the projects but then some

00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:58,130
countries can even have users of the

00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:02,750
output of the user of the project right

00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:05,510
if you consider um well what press is a

00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:08,870
great example of that right I mean

00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:12,680
WordPress they has like a community a

00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:16,370
building WordPress right and then it has

00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:21,170
a community building

00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:24,800
well you know building things with

00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,750
WordPress right like websites and then

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,370
it has a community of people actually

00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:32,480
consuming the content on those websites

00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:33,710
right and so you know like that's the

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,230

the central project all right I think I

00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:56,810
