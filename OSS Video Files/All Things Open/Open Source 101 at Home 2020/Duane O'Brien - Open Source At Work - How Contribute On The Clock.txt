	Open Source At Work - How Contribute On The Clock

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Duane O'Brien, Indeed

Abstract: You've use open source. You love it. You've always wanted to give back, but you haven't been sure where to start. Wouldn't it be great if there was some way you could contribute to open source as part of your job?

This talk will give you all the tools you need to get up an running as an open source contributor as part of your day job. Attendees will learn:

 - Tools to help secure approval from your employer
 - How to get buy-in from your manager

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,400
this is the open source at work how to

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,260
contribute on the clock talk if that's

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,869
the talk you're here for you are in the

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,250
right place if you're looking for

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,619
another talk you'll want to click back

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,470
over on sessions and find the card for

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,590
that my name is Dwayne O'Brien

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,630
I work in indeed.com my pronouns are

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,910
he/him you can see my Twitter handle and

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,530
my email address there feel free to take

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,870
pictures I've granted permission for

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,379
recording feel free to to blog about it

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,270
email me or tweet about it

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,550
love to get some feedback on this

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,530
particular talk brief background about

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,050
me I'm the head of open source and

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,899
indeed so I run the entire open source

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,129
program office my current projects I'm

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,020
heavily involved in a project called

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,430
Foss responders if you look at foster

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,199
responders calm you can see information

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,479
about that and I also drive the Foss

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,100
contributor fund at indeed and drive

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,280
adoption of that and other companies and

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,010
you can read about that at godaddy.com /

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,100
Foss contributor fund my most recent

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,799
contribution for open source was a pull

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,270
request to add a particular PDF to a

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,520
form a PDF of a form to a repository as

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,250
part of the to do group which was a

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,110
couple weeks ago I'm trying to pivot to

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,610
talk about my most recent contribution

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,970
rather than telling the story of how I

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,860
first got involved in open source in an

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,040
effort to invite more people to share

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,970
their recent contributions as opposed to

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,740
maybe some some pedigree information now

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,090
logistically I can see questions that

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,640
come up in chat in the bottom right

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,799
corner as they come up I will be

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,360
unlikely to end address questions as

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
we're going through the talk but I'm

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,729
going to leave time to talk about

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,680
anything at the end of it if there's

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,140
particular feedback if you're getting

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,880
noise in the background if you need me

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,399
to slow down because it's hard to

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,140
understand anything like that feel free

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,670
to pass that along in the chat I will be

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,459
kind of paying attention to it but

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,890
trying to also stay focused on the talk

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,590
and I will preemptively beg a little

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,590
forgiveness because I've been talking in

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,690
the indeed Expo booth all morning and so

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,870
my my throat's reaching the end of its

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,269
life for the day so I've got some some

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,800
tea to help me stay focus there and to

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,500
help with that I will also be available

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,019
to talk about this any of these subjects

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,500
after the talk at the indeed expo hall

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:44,590
as well so this talk who is this talk

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,080
for if you've ever wanted to contribute

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,480
at work but you haven't known where to

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,400
start or you've been hesitant to ask and

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,290
you've been denied permission to

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,110
contribute or you've been doing it

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,970
secretly without permission or if you've

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,400
been given permission but you don't feel

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,640
like you're getting recognized this talk

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,010
should be right in what you're looking

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,170
for if you're an old hand at

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,739
contributing to work there may not be as

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,650
much useful information in the talk here

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,750
but if this is you or if you or any of

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,220
these people in the list here then I

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,750
think this talk will have some stuff in

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,519
it for you

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,620
the short version of this talk is that

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
when it comes to making contributions at

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,370
work you should start with the things

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,140
that you use all the time you should

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:35,440
always ask for permission both because

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,510
doing it without permission is risky but

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,720
also because if you ask you will open up

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,340
the opportunity for people to say yes

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,180
I'm seeing in the chat at least one

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,850
person can't okay sound is OK in chat

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,530
solve a work problem the closer to your

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,090
work the problem is that you're solving

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,190
the more likely is that your

00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,590
contributions are to be improved you

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,299
should begin with non-controversial

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,430
contributions and I'll talk a little bit

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,170
about what that means and then some

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,870
guidance on how to find your allies and

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,100
keep track of the outcomes from your

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,859
contributions what for when you're

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:16,359
talking about them later so let's talk

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:19,169
about where to start I encourage people

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,889
to to begin their open source

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,330
contribution work with the things that

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,830
you're using every day so look for

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,040
opportunities in your dependencies now

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,720
there

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,350
all kinds of different opportunities

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,620
that might turn up in your dependencies

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,560
but let's talk about what I mean by by

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,570
dependencies this could be a software

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,510
module that you're bringing in that

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,750
you're depending on for code that you're

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,270
writing directly or it could just be

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,070
software that you're using every day as

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,930
part of your work maybe you're using BS

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,970
code are you using atom both of which

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,360
you would be able to make contributions

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,180
to or it could be a dependency in terms

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,580
of this is software or infrastructure

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,290
that you are deploying code onto these

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,350
are all different kinds of dependencies

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,170
so I mean dependency in the broadest

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,820
sense here and there are all kinds of

00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,000
opportunities hidden in these

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,490
dependencies that you can identify as a

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,620
place to get started there might be

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,280
missing documentation there could be as

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,380
complete tests there might just not be a

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,980
process for how to contribute to the

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,230
project that's been documented they

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,390
might be willing to accept contributions

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,820
but not giving any guidance to

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:40,120
contributors on what's that pressure

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,590
what that process would look like you

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,990
should also pay attention to see which

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,070
dependencies have relatively strong

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,090
communities a healthy flow of

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,630
contributions that are coming in and out

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,590
active maintained errs who are engaged

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,500
with contributors and just a broad

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,200
coalition of folks who are involved in

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,850
the project in particular paying

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,920
attention to projects that are

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,980
dependencies that have good first issues

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,950
tagged and github can be a great way to

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,290
help find some of those opportunities to

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,030
make a contribution and I want to spend

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,730
just a moment here talking about a

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,140
project that an experimental project

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,910
that we just recently released called

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,770
Mariner what Mariner does is it takes a

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,280
list of dependencies or specifically

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,960
takes a list of github repositories and

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,820
looks through those repositories to see

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,390
if there are any issues that are tagged

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,160
good first issue or otherwise tagged are

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,900
labeled to say that they would be good

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,090
for first contributors

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,800
it is very early days on this project

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,639
but this is something that we use fairly

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,020
heavily internally to get insights into

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,690
what those contribution opportunities

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,400
are in some of our dependencies if

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,340
you're interested in that if you go to

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,080
the indeed edge Oregon github mariner

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,960
will be right in there the next thing

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,220
that I want to advise you on is to think

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,979
about the things that would help the

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,729
business which opportunities are going

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:16,840
to help the most when looked at from the

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:18,580
perspective of your employer so there

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,250
are a lot of different ways that you can

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,620
look at this but if you think about two

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:28,479
different contributions that you could

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:32,110
make one of those contributions is only

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,229
in a dependency that you use and one of

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,590
those contributions is in a dependency

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:42,370
that is used by dozens of teams around

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,560
the rest of your organization if you had

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,750
to pick between the two of those making

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
a contribution into a dependency that is

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,940
used by a wider group of the

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,250
organization that is an opportunity that

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,229
can that can help have more impact on

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,810
the company and have more effect on the

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,610
business so in particular look for

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,800
projects that are used outside of

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,250
engineering and the reason I flag this

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,770
is because as an engineer if you're

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,710
making a contribution into something

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,090
that you depend on you're sort of

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,669
speaking your own language right you

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,409
know I write JavaScript I need to make a

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,539
change into this JavaScript dependency

00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,270
so I'm gonna this is all kind of a

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,130
closed loop but if there are open source

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,520
projects that are significantly used

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:31,449
outside engineering the odds are that

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,520
folks on that team have a smaller set of

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,159
skills that would be relevant to

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,779
contribute into the project if they're

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,490
not if they don't have engineering

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,839
skills making engineering contributions

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,990
into those projects will be harder and

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,520
so take a look around and see if there

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,200
are open source projects that are used

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,570
outside of engineering in particular if

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,770
they use everywhere to see if you have

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,580
an opportunity to do a lot of good there

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:59,080
some other things

00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,790
can that can help you think about the

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,980
impact of your contribution

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,899
what do you understand the least is

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,540
there a piece of technology that you or

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,149
your employer just don't understand very

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,250
well or don't have a lot of internal

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,589
knowledge about gaining that knowledge

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,029
will be helpful know which things are

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:20,220
going to be the hardest to replace if

00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:22,420
you have to move to a different solution

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,740
or are there dependencies that are used

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,709
by really critical pieces of

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,570
infrastructure it may only be a piece of

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,339
piece of infrastructure that's worked on

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,430
by a few people but if a significant

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,510
amount of your if your your traffic or

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,370
your business flows through that

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,010
particular set of dependencies that

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:43,690
would be a good place to prioritize your

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:46,930
contributions and if you're just getting

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,760
started the easiest thing and the

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,740
highest impact that you can do is really

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,370
start by opening those issues as you

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,899
find them and so there are all kinds of

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:02,620
situations where as I will speak in the

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:05,380
specific as a developer when I was

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,360
adopting open source technologies when I

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,810
was picking up something new to use for

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,240
the first time I I would spend a lot of

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,010
time like I find something where the

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,750
documentation wasn't quite right and I

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,640
would it wouldn't work in my environment

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,770
and I'd fiddle with it and try to get to

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,899
work in my environment or the sample

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,940
files wouldn't work anymore or there'd

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,380
be some sort of like undocumented change

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,880
that I would need to make in order to

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,970
get it to work and my typical behavior

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,070
was I would fight with it until I got it

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,180
working and as soon as I got it working

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,770
I moved on to the next thing

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,140
going back and opening issues in the

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,430
project is the single most useful thing

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,320
that you can do in that circumstance

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,600
like maybe you don't have time to fix

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,670
the bug maybe you don't have time to

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,190
really dig into the bug but at least

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,949
reporting out hey I had to do some stuff

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,079
that wasn't really documented here that

00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,180
get some signal to the project that they

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,620
have either additional documentation

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,089
that they need or there may be just

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,250
things broken that they don't know about

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,440
if you see someone has already filed an

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,900
issue you should comment on on

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,910
that issue just to give additional

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,440
signal to the project that there are

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,530
other folks who are getting that problem

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,060
so whenever you hit an issue open an

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,940
issue whenever you find a bug open an

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,220
issue if you see the issue already

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,720
exists comment on the issue tell people

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,240
that you are also having that same

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,250
problem if you get new information

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,470
update the issue that you've already

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,300
opened so that the the maintainer is

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,340
have the most recent set of information

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,010
available to them so that they can

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,260
address the problem and if you see

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,690
somebody already appears to be on top of

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,220
this issue they're giving great reports

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,830
they're talking about what the problem

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,070
is if all you do is just give that issue

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,470
a thumbs up or a plus one in the

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,630
repository you send signal to the

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,740
project hey this is a problem that other

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,600
people were happen are having and it may

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,090
be bigger than just this one person so

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,710
these are all really easy things to do

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,180
it's typically not controversial for

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,160
from an employer's perspective for you

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,860
to open an issue in a repo if you find a

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:20,710
bug and it can sort of set the stage for

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:24,540
the conversation of fixing that issue

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,540
when you come to it a little bit later

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,000
so in terms of also figuring out where

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,290
it's easy to start let's talk about what

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,930
I meant by non-controversial

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,520
contributions there are some

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,220
contributions that will be easier to

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,750
approve than others and in particular if

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,400
you're just getting started

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,290
making contributions at work and you're

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,060
just sort of going through the process

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,580
of getting your manager on board and

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,700
getting your employer on board to

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,670
contributing staying with starting with

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:58,360
non-controversial contributions can can

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,220
help people get used to this idea things

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,260
that tend not to be controversial from

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,260
this perspective documentation updates

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,910
and improvements if you if you find a

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,310
problem in the documentation and you go

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,080
back and fix it it's it's rare that

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,670
people were that your boss or your

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,380
employer would have an issue for that as

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,600
long as didn't take too much time

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,330
improving test coverage accessibility

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,270
updates those are those are both things

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,180
that tend not to be controversial from a

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,280
tradition standpoint and contributions

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,160
on the fringes and so I I don't want to

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,090
spend a great deal of time here but in

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,700
general one of the main concerns that

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,740
comes up when you are trying to bring an

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,160
employer on board and get buy-in for

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,830
making contributions is concerns over

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,170
what a company's core IP is what are the

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:50,290
the core intellectual property concerns

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,300
that a company has they don't want you

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,250
to give away secrets they don't want you

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,390
to give away special sauce they don't

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,000
want you to give away anything that

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,890
might have patents on it or otherwise

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,220
have some competitive competitive

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,860
advantage understanding what the core IP

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,110
concerns are of your business is an

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,730
important part of this because as far

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,220
away as you can get from those when

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,020
you're first started first getting

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,820
started and making contributions the

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,510
further away from the core IP the easier

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:23,680
it is for people to say yes so by way of

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:27,640
example your company probably does not

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,630
make money providing services to

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,870
customers around kubernetes you might

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,700
use kubernetes to deploy some of your

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,400
technology or amend your product but you

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,220
probably aren't selling kubernetes to

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,810
your customers it's far enough away it's

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,870
kind of an infrastructure part of your

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,790
organization it would be easier to

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,440
approve those contributions than it

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,200
would be to approve contributions that

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,900
are very close to business concerns

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,900
I didn't say easy I said easier because

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:02,500
in some cases it could still be hard and

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,320
my final recommendation here is that for

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,090
your first contributions avoiding

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,540
projects that have some kind of legal

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:12,340
legal agreement will make it easier to

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,800
get approval and what what I mean here

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,610
is that there are are some projects that

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,770
require you to sign something called a

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,230
contributor License Agreement or ask

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,540
your employer to sign a contributor

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,060
License Agreement on your behalf or

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,240
others that will use something called a

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,890
developer certificate of origin which is

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,750
kind of a click-through agreement that

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,040
says I'm allowed to give you this

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,630
contribution they both have

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,250
about the same effect there are

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,120
important differences between the two

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,800
for this conversation it doesn't matter

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,500
what matters is if you get a block of

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,990
legal text you shouldn't agree to it on

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,820
behalf of your company without getting

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,740
approval from your company and if this

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,319
is the first time through the process of

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,930
approving contributions that's going to

00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,459
add friction to the process and it may

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,970
take some time to get folks up to speed

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,500
so if the project requires a legal

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,829
agreement for you to make a contribution

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,199
it may not be the best choice to go in

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:14,829
as the first contributor and to get your

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,660
first contributions approved another

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:19,389
thing that can help sort of warm your

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,880
company up to the idea of contributing

00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,970
to open source is if you start doing

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,610
inner source first inner source if

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,170
you're not familiar is just taking the

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,389
lessons from developing open source

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,690
software and applying them to the way

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:38,620
you develop software internally in in

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,600
plain speak this is finding another team

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,730
inside your company where you can make a

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,589
contribution into their project so that

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,709
you're already modeling open source

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,420
behavior without a lot of the concerns

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,389
that can sometimes come with getting

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,889
your open source contributions approved

00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,779
building a culture of inner source and

00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,389
doing your practice of inner source and

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,490
in particular you yourself contributing

00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:03,579
into projects using an inner source

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,100
model can help warm folks around you up

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:09,640
to the idea of doing open source and in

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:12,490
fact we've seen inner source serve as an

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,679
on road to open source historically at a

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,059
number of organizations I'm going to

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:22,059
pause here and take a drink before I go

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:24,760
forward the final thing I want to say

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,559
here is that as you are getting started

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,929
in this it's really important for you to

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,270
blaze a trail you want to leave a path

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,280
that others can follow if you are the

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,929
first one going through the process of

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,750
getting open source contributions

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,179
approved at your company the more you

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,610
talk about it the more you socialize the

00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,710
experience internally the easier you

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,780
make it for the next person to get their

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,370
contributions approved as well so

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,780
talking about your experiences at

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,180
all hands or other internal

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,550
presentations writing an internal blog

00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,200
post about the process you might even be

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,010
the person who starts the open source

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,960
slack channel at your employer even if

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,670
it's just you and maybe one other person

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,470
in there having a conversation about

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,110
open source you've provided a space

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,880
where other people can come find you and

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,150
a place that other people can connect

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,980
and get some help finding a friend and

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,540
recruiting somebody inside the

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,180
organization who also is interested in

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,429
open source is a great way to help kind

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,880
of blazed that trail and build that

00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:28,700
practice and between the two of you you

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,980
can even start a study hall hey every

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,740
Friday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,390
o'clock we're gonna sit down in this

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,400
zoom call I guess it would be now or a

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,130
conference room once we are back in that

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,660
place and we're just gonna like focus on

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,480
making open source contributions and

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,000
support each other you can sort of serve

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,950
as that beacon and Trailblazer inside

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,140
your company to help spread the practice

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,210
so I'm gonna move on from sort of

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,620
finding places to start and sort of the

00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,360
beginning a part of the process it's

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,370
been some time talking about how to get

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,650
buy-in from your boss and how to talk to

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,500
your boss about making your first open

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,970
source contributions my first question

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,250
is have you asked them now I indicated

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,530
at the beginning this talk was for you

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,380
if you are contributing but not telling

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,030
anybody there are so many ways that you

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,920
could potentially get yourself into

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,890
trouble doing that that I don't even

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,990
want to bother trying to list them that

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,690
is not the path to success and it's not

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:33,200
a path to happiness when it comes to

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,210
contributing to open source but I have

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,950
personally heard people say in

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,320
organizations where I have worked or

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,690
where organ in in organizations that I

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,920
know have open source programs that they

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,390
didn't think they were allowed to

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,590
contribute to open source oh they

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,840
thought they could get it trouble or

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,490
fired for contributing to open source or

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,110
they might cite the employment agreement

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,740
hey the employment agreement that I

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,500
signed says these specific things and

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,690
that gave me some cause for concern

00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,540
about contributing to open source or

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,010
maybe there's just sort of this this

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,080
presupposition

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,500
that they'll never they'll never let me

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,300
make those contributions anyway or it's

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,040
too much trouble to try to go out and

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,740
talk about this stuff

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,900
and in many of these cases the person

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,950
who's who has said these things hasn't

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,170
actually asked anyone and so like if I

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,270
was gonna give you one piece of advice

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,920
here it is to always ask if you don't

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:32,050
ask you don't give someone the

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,970
opportunity to say yes and so I would

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,650
start by making sure that you asked

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,050
don't be afraid to ask there are some

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,660
things that you can do around your ask

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,820
that can help you set up for success

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,110
the first question your boss is likely

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:49,780
to ask is how much time will this take

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:53,050
and knowing the answer to that ahead of

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,780
time is going to help it is very hard to

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,910
say yes you contribute can contribute to

00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,410
open source if I'm your manager and I

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,500
don't know what I'm giving up in return

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,350
and not all open source contributions

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,880
require the same amount of time it might

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,890
be something that the work is already

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,230
done you just need to kind of sit down

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,310
and do it and they would never have

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,860
known the difference you just are

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,560
looking for permission maybe you want to

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,240
spend the afternoon doing it or like

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,770
it's the kind of thing where you can

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,030
submit the pull request but you know

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,530
it's going to take a little bit of time

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,940
over the next couple of weeks in order

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,290
to land that pull request in the project

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,940
or it might be you know significant

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,380
enough that it's gonna be a big part of

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,990
your quarter or you want to do it on an

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,450
ongoing basis if you don't know how much

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,980
time it's going to take get an answer to

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,840
that question or at least get a sense

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,550
for that question before your approach

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,350
your boss and ask if you're allowed to

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,610
so that's the first question you're

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,760
likely to get how much time will this

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,830
take the second one what is it what is

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,720
it that you want to contribute and the

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,820
more you can clearly articulate what the

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,280
contribution is the easier it is for

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,500
your boss to say yes you want to make it

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,740
as easy as possible for your boss to say

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,190
yes right so you know if this is just

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,320
updates to the documentation that is

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,970
different from I'm gonna be writing a

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,680
massive feature that's going to take a

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,920
whole lot of code over a long period of

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,610
time so coming with a clear articulation

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,460
of what the contribution

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,649
you may be all you need to do is there

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,419
was a bug in this library where there

00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:27,970
was a period instead of a comma and it

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:30,190
fixes a bug right before a bunch of

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,580
people that's a pretty easy thing to say

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,380
yes to so you know it could just be a

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,850
few lines of code or a couple of files

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,139
implement a feature there's all kinds of

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:42,309
different sizes of contributions and

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,700
understanding how big the contribution

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:47,259
is helps your boss understand if they

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,809
need to tap someone on the shoulder to

00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:52,750
get their own kind of approval by way by

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:54,009
way of example if your manager is not

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,710
familiar with contributing to open

00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,389
source and you say hey I want to go like

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,789
update the documentation to this it's

00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:02,799
probably easy for them to say yes if you

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,059
want to contribute a feature they're

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,200
probably going to want to talk to

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,750
somebody to make sure there aren't any

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,759
policies in place around that right so

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,370
know what you want to contribute and

00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:16,090
know be able to clearly articulate what

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:18,100
that contribution is the next question

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,960
you are likely to get is why are you

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,669
doing it why do you want to do this why

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,480
are we doing this why should we be doing

00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:27,940
this and there are a wide range of

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,350
reasons to contribute to open source but

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,950
I want to encourage you to frame your

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,740
contribution with benefits like who is

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,450
this going to benefit and in particular

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:42,759
the closer you can tie those benefits to

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,070
your team's needs your company's needs

00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:48,519
even your needs the easier it will be

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,299
for your manager to say yes I always

00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:54,100
like to use as my sort of pet example

00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,169
the Dungeons & Dragons character

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,269
generator right if you go to your boss

00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,860
and you want to make contributions to

00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:03,730
your Dungeons & Dragons character

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,399
generator and you are a company that

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,909
sells software as a service for sales

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:11,200
folks there's literally no benefit it's

00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:12,879
why I won't say there's literally no

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,009
benefit it's very difficult to draw the

00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:17,379
benefit line from you being involved in

00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:21,730
that project on work time - what's good

00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:24,429
for the company but if you can tie those

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,960
benefits to things that the team will

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,380
realize or that you will realize or the

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,940
company will realize for example maybe

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,920
you found a problem in the instructions

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,410
and you want to make sure that the next

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,510
time you come do this you remember the

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,430
problem that you had so fixing those

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,040
instructions would is just even if it's

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,210
only self serving for you or for anyone

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,620
else on the team you know the

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,420
instructions will be right going forward

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,270
that's a benefit that is easy to

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,380
understand if there are other engineers

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,320
at the company who are using the

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:58,450
technology that is a way that you can

00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,730
frame those benefits if you have an open

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,140
source library or dependency that you're

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,670
using that you've had to do something

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,340
special to in order to get it to work

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,750
inside your environment pushing that fix

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,080
upstream means you don't have to

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,630
maintain your own internal fork and this

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,910
is a huge opportunity for you to sort of

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,910
set the table for this conversation

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:22,360
about being how long-term technical debt

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:24,190
is managed right as soon as you fork

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,990
something and bring it internal you own

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,520
that fork by yourself forever and you

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,610
make it harder for you to pull in

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,320
upstream fixes by pushing those changes

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,420
upstream you can stay on more recent

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,770
versions you don't have to invest time

00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,720
that you're not going to invest in

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,100
maintaining that internal fork there's

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,920
all kinds of good that you can realize

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,370
there this might also be about reducing

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,720
business risk maybe there is a huge

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,880
piece of technology that no one

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,740
understands if you've got a huge piece

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,010
of technology that you use and no one

00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:57,190
understands it you are incurring some

00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,840
levels of business risk just because if

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,670
it breaks you don't know what to do so

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,600
developing that expertise can help

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,100
reduce some of that risk and this might

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,870
also be sort of a reputational

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,150
conversation there's a lot of desire for

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,860
this feature we could be the ones who

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,360
step in to do this and it's gonna look

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,040
good for us it's gonna make it easiest

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,690
easier for us to connect to other

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,120
developers and other engineers so we

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,590
roll back through here for how long is

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,550
it going to take what are you doing and

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,550
why do you want to do it

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,680
above all make sure that you're solving

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,540
a work problem maybe you're solving this

00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,250
problem for your boss maybe those you're

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,600
solving this problem for your team

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,880
maybe you're solving this problem for

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,160
your employer but solve somebody's

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,080
problem make somebody's life easier as

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,080
part of your contribution even if it's

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,490
yours if you're not solving a problem it

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,240
will be harder for you to get buy-in for

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,240
your contributions

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,800
so let's finally talk about talking to

00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,380
your employer not finally well we'll

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,720
talk about talking to your employer this

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,120
is a shorter section by comparison to

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,380
the others because if you are an

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,960
individual contributor who was looking

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,360
to get buy-in and support you it may be

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,620
difficult to influence conversations

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,820
that are necessary to talk to you

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,710
employer but there are some tools here

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,740
that we can use and then we'll talk

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,810
about some strategies for accounting for

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,940
it during any kind of review or

00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:28,610
evaluations so if your manager is okay

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,110
but maybe your employer is not okay

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,120
as far as your contributing to open

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,130
source the first thing you should do is

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,200
identify some of your internal allies

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,780
you're looking for people who can help

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,690
you influence open source policy at your

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,580
employer and they could be literally

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,890
anywhere in your company they might be

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,770
leads or managers of teams who heavily

00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,930
rely on open source there could be

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:54,230
working groups or guilds that are that

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:56,300
are within ecosystems that tend to use a

00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,850
lot of open source there might be

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,650
infrastructure groups who deploy on open

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,000
source technologies and who recognize

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,970
that they have a reliance on it without

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,980
a culture of giving back to it or an

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,340
architecture group who is responsible

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,840
for sort of looking across the the

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,280
entire company and making some strategic

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,730
decisions

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,730
odds are if the company is sufficiently

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,380
large there will be somebody at the

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,350
director level or above

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,360
who hasn't belief or a passion for open

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,790
source even if it's not showing up in

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,700
the way they do their work going out and

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,950
figuring out who some of these folks are

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,150
might take a little bit of ground work

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,280
you're going to have to kind of dig into

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,210
the org chart and see but you might also

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,120
find allies in

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,259
in recruiting allies in employer brand

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,720
allies at HR like they could be anywhere

00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:52,000
and it might be a little bit like

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,070
finding somebody at work who happens to

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,960
also like your favorite band but you've

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,179
never talked about that band at work so

00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,950
go out and talk about open source and

00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:01,600
see who perks their ears up and see who

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,190
gets interested in the conversation and

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,549
that will help you identify your

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,769
internal allies you also have external

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,080
allies in a couple of different forms I

00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:13,149
highly encourage you to engage with the

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,710
to do group the two new group is a

00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:16,990
working group of open source program

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,850
offices there are a bunch of us in the

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,700
to do group that share best practices

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:24,190
that share tools that share learnings we

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,139
can also share strategies for helping

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,720
get your employer on on board with the

00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:31,330
idea of you contributing to open source

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,750
you should also reach out to open source

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,120
advocates generosity is a core value in

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,580
the open source community if you see

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,590
people out there evangelizing for open

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,440
source or at conferences like this one

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,470
talking about open source or otherwise

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,950
advocating for open source either in

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,750
companies or in the industry as a whole

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,059
reach out and get their opinion and ask

00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,710
them for help the more focused you can

00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:00,940
make your ask the more likely you are to

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:04,269
get meaningful help but reaching out and

00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,919
having these conversations can also help

00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,720
you find some allies and there are

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,639
plenty of people who would be willing to

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,179
jump on a call with your manager or your

00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:15,279
legal counsel or your CTO or anyone at

00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:18,610
any level in the organization and talk

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,110
to them about the value of both the

00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,299
employer getting involved in open source

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,480
and you specifically being able to

00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:29,049
contribute to open source a thing that

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,789
can help is to provide some sample

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,519
policies there are a number of

00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,169
organizations who have published good

00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,750
documentation about what their open

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,580
source policies are Google has done it

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,110
Verizon has done it the londo has done

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,879
it get lab has a whole handbook that

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:48,580
basically covers all of their policies

00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:50,470
about how they work as a company and at

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,799
the to do group there is a github repo

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,269
of just policies that have been

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,269
aggregate it over time folks who have

00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:00,669
published documentation to either

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:02,200
provide guidance on how their employees

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:04,779
can contribute to open source and they

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,309
can serve as a model for how your

00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,929
company might approach the problem so

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:10,539
you don't have to write these from

00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:14,639
scratch there are many of them already

00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:17,739
out there that you can use as a template

00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,929
so that's some strategies for talking to

00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:23,080
your employer find your allies tag in

00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:24,100
some help and and use some sample

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,940
policies to kind of seed that

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,320
conversation there are lots of people at

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,210
your company who are probably interested

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,980
in having this conversation and through

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,039
different perspectives or different

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:40,419
lenses I'd be happy to talk about you

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:44,230
know more tactical ideas there either

00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:47,409
here or at the indeed Expo booth after

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,700
the session so let's talk about getting

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:54,580
recognition for your contributions most

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,139
companies have some kind of process that

00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:01,539
you go through you know either

00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:03,340
yearly or quarterly or monthly or maybe

00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:05,080
never but you wish that you there was

00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,489
some kind of evaluation process to look

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,710
at how you're doing the work that you're

00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:11,169
doing and giving you feedback on the

00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,340
work that you're doing and sort of

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:17,799
spreading out the work that you've done

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,929
over the last X amount of time to make

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:23,109
decisions about promotion and career

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:25,090
progression getting recognition for

00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:28,179
those open source contributions during

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,159
that process in particular if you are

00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:34,960
the first person who has gone in to make

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,309
open source contributions can be a bit

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,960
of an uphill battle the first time

00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:41,019
through again you want to make sure that

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,090
you blaze a trail and leave you know a

00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,679
good path for people who come behind you

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,049
but let's talk about getting some

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,759
recognition for contributions now I will

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,759
I will confess that

00:32:51,250 --> 00:33:00,570
I would say for the first half of my

00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:04,180
tech career I really really undervalued

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,640
the importance of keeping track of the

00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,150
work that I was doing so that I could

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,500
participate in reviews and performance

00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,210
evaluations and any kind of level this

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,340
wasn't anything that I was taught this

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:22,720
wasn't anything that my first half-dozen

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:25,570
managers helped me with it really wasn't

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,970
until about ten years ago maybe a little

00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:31,960
more I would say that I had a manager

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:35,260
who sat down and helped me understand my

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,630
role in the process and keeping track of

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,870
the work that I was doing was a big part

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:43,690
of that so I highly encourage you just

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,400
in general if you are dealing with a

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,140
process where you go through annual

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,640
reviews or quarterly reviews or whatever

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,910
to keep a running list of your work but

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,900
let's let's focus this in particular on

00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:58,050
on your open source contributions if you

00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,550
follow up on issues and pull requests

00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,110
you will be able to talk more about the

00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,590
outcome of those issues and pull

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,180
requests and I think that's going to be

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,639
that's going to be more useful in the

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,750
conversation than just saying I opened

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,370
issues or I submitted explore requests

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,970
because so well like that's just those

00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,679
are just numbers now I'm not saying that

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:24,210
summary metrics aren't valuable I think

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:27,639
it is worth having some summary metrics

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,230
that make it easy at a glance for your

00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:33,040
manager or for other folks who are

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,450
looking and your your contributions to

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,669
understand what they're looking at I

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:39,129
opened with so many issues there's so

00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:41,740
many we're closed those kinds of things

00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,450
they're useful but they should never be

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,100
the end of any conversation they should

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,659
pay the shorthand for the beginning of a

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,540
conversation um

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,629
focus on drawing attention to your top

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,919
three to five contributions if you've

00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:55,540
gotten to the point that you're able to

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,820
make regular contributions to open

00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,770
source as part of your work and if

00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,440
you're doing it on a weekly basis and if

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,390
you get evaluated once a quarter that's

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,220
13 things that you did over the course

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,420
of a quarter

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,670
your manager probably has a bunch of

00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,349
other people to sort of evaluate and

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,329
look at things and reading through all

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,130
13 of those to figure out which were the

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:19,190
most impact for the most important ones

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,109
that that's likely more work than

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,539
they're going to be able to do and

00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:25,490
require more time than they'll have but

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:27,380
if you draw attention to your top three

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,619
to five contributions these are the sort

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,819
of the highlights that makes it easy to

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:33,740
look at the things that were most

00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:35,180
impactful and then you can have a bunch

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,079
of things you say and also I did these

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,670
other things and you want to highlight

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,289
the benefits of those contributions

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,539
focus on the outcome of those

00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:49,220
contributions so you you you open these

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:50,809
five issues and as a result what

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,510
happened you submitted this pull request

00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,420
and as a result what happened and in

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,700
particular accounting for the long-term

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,619
benefits and framing those benefits as

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,480
what your team how your team has

00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:04,910
benefited how your employer has

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,630
benefited how you have benefited and

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:10,160
frankly how your manager has benefited

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,859
are are all ways that you can frame

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,390
those benefits of a contributions you

00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:16,039
know in a way that makes it easier for

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,750
people to understand and recognize those

00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:23,869
contributions you know I I hear

00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:27,349
occasionally from an open source

00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:29,660
contributor who says sort of in a in a

00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:33,190
frustrated sense my manager just doesn't

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,900
understand what I do you're right right

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,910
if if you're making open source

00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,770
contributions and this is not certain

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,140
your managers cup of tea they probably

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,299
don't understand it and the people that

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,789
your manager is talking to to evaluate

00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:48,020
your open source contributions they may

00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,849
not understand it either you want to

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,799
make it as easy for your manager to say

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,750
yes as possible and you want to make it

00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:55,670
as easy for your manager and their peers

00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,890
to understand the impact of your

00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,390
contributions make that as easy for them

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,670
as possible and it will be easier for

00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,750
them to recognize you for the work that

00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,980
you're doing

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:08,140
assume best intent in

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,369
with these things and I guess I should

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,380
have opened with that at the beginning

00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,550
if you have a relationship with your

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,960
manager that prevents these

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:19,930
conversations my only real advice is to

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,520
do your best to find a manager that you

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,300
can work with and have honest two-way

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,770
communication convert converting someone

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,119
who don't you who you can't even talk to

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:33,520
about this stuff is going to be

00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:35,020
particularly hard and so you know as I

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,869
said in the last slide focus on the

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,550
outcomes draw attention to some specific

00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,640
benefits there are different categories

00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:47,070
of benefits that you will realize from

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,540
the contributions it may be that

00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,150
contributing to open source has helped

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,950
you improve team processes like how bugs

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,680
are flown through the process or how

00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:58,510
bugs are triaged by your team or it may

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,339
have enabled you to bring improvements

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,670
to other internal projects might not be

00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:08,380
obvious on the surface of them don't be

00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:10,270
afraid to be a little generous in how

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,150
much time you are saving by not having

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,920
to apply custom patches right if it if

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,079
it's the kind of thing that that only

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,290
takes an hour but it takes an hour every

00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,060
two weeks okay so you saved almost half

00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:26,740
a week of time over the course of the

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:31,359
year 26 hours in the course of pushing

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:35,560
this patch upstream and that's just for

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,240
the first year right so be generous with

00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,380
the amount of time that you're saving by

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,630
not having to apply custom patches my my

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,950
my estimation is that no matter how

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,450
generous you are you're probably under

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,210
estimating the amount of time that will

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,430
take to actually manage those custom

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,530
patched and those internal for open

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,599
source repositories you might talk about

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,579
some specific things that you learned

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,050
from participating in these

00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:02,530
contributions whether it's new

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:07,020
technologies new skillsets new processes

00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:11,589
just aha moments something like that and

00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:14,589
anytime that you see the community sort

00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:16,359
of recognizing you or your employer for

00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:19,510
the contribution that you've made be

00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:22,270
sure to tag those in you know if

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:25,630
if someone is participating in the poll

00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,670
review process pull request review

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,590
process and they say I think it's great

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,050
that your employer is doing this like

00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,609
link to it right provide a link provide

00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,200
a link to people saying thank you like

00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:37,330
make sure that you call out that people

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,340
are in the community are recognizing

00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,290
your contributions and it will help send

00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,540
signal to your employer that they should

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,580
also be recognizing them as well

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,220
and and finally I would call out you can

00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,940
you can look at peers or employees that

00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,550
you have mentored as part of the process

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:56,560
this is a thing that I think most

00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,380
companies want they want they want to

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,980
see engineers and their employees

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,510
mentoring and helping each other and

00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,119
tying that kind of work to your

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,320
open-source contribution work is the

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,710
thing that can help you gain recognition

00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,650
for those contributions as well so that

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:18,760
was a lot I've got five I got more than

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,200
five minutes I were at 20 minutes till

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,240
the top of the hour so I can hang out

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,310
for a while and take questions again I

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,000
will also be at the NZ booth afterwards

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,490
I thank you for attending the talk I

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,160
don't think I can add people to the

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,990
conversation by video but if you want to

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,359
ask questions and the chat here on the

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:41,200
side of the session I'd be happy to take

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:44,310
them in line here Carol says it was a

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,310
great talk Thank You Carol

00:40:52,020 --> 00:41:01,110
I will also confess that sitting in

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,900
complete silence is one of the most

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,310
difficult things for me to do so anyone

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,060
who was clock-watching I made it about

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:11,160
20 seconds before I got a chance to I

00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,050
felt compelled to say something out loud

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:24,780
oh hi Vicky I didn't know you were here

00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:28,200
today Vicky speaks at the top of the

00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,580
next hour I did know you were here today

00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,670
I just forgot you were here today I'm

00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:36,540
sorry it's been that kind of day and

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:39,570
thank you Ray and good to see you again

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,370
it was actually so ray Camden and I know

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,370
each other from back in Adobe days so

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,000
Nick do you have recommendations for

00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,860
keeping track of work you've done not

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,180
necessarily an open source do you use

00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,390
any kind of tools to do that do I have a

00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,190
recommendation don't overthink it start

00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,710
with the text document it's gonna get

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:05,210
you halfway through the quarter before

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:08,190
you actually settle on a tool when I

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,810
started doing this I tried to keep a

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:13,440
folder of things that I was keeping

00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:16,680
track of and that didn't work out so

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,750
well for me but really like my my best

00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,540
piece of advice there is whether you do

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,490
it in a text doc where you send yourself

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,990
emails star emails write it in a

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,080
notebook doesn't matter do it a series

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:32,970
of post-its start doing it tomorrow or

00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,350
start doing it today because my own

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,270
experiences I will spend more time

00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:40,500
trying to choose the perfect tool or the

00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:45,900
right tool and that means I spent less

00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:48,030
time tracking my work is there a way to

00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,450
get a copy of our slides for reference

00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:53,550
of my slides for reference I have no

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:57,210
idea if there's a way to get a copy of

00:42:53,550 --> 00:43:00,480
the slides but I will do something I

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:02,430
generally don't do which is I will just

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,470
drop a link to my slides here in the

00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:08,680
chat it is this

00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,570
public so there are sides and if anyone

00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,250
would like to hit me up on Twitter or

00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,170
email me directly I will send you a link

00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:18,340
to the slides or a PDF of the slides

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:19,990
afterwards ELISA wants to know a great

00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,349
open source contribution I made it work

00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:26,340
let me scrub to see if there are other

00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:26,340
questions here

00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:37,540
whoo lots of other questions goodness

00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:38,920
gracious I'm gonna take Roseanne guitar

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,900
as this question here we're looking to

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,520
start blogging do you recommend creating

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,190
your own or using platforms like

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,750
LinkedIn or your employees website I'm

00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,460
assuming this is in reference to my

00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,460
right and internal blog post about it

00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,310
and I'll mark the difference between

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:58,930
internal or external my advice for this

00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,790
in particular when you're trying to

00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,609
socialize the open-source contribution

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,650
work that you have done at work for your

00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:07,540
internal community is go to wherever it

00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,310
is that they read comments that really

00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,530
they read their content so if the

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,849
company has a wiki that gets a lot of

00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,760
traffic put it where they're gonna find

00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:18,730
it if they're if your company like

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,330
values network of internal blogs put it

00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,550
wherever they're gonna find that value

00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:29,280
if you are able to get permission to

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:31,660
talk about it externally my goodness I

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,750
guess my first recommendation would be

00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,130
to email open at open source comm and

00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,690
see if they're interested in the blog

00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,450
post because that will immediately

00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,700
connect you to a wide audience and I

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,109
think I got that email address right if

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,070
I didn't I hope someone will correct me

00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:49,839
Matthew Foley what's a good way to get

00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,339
people to give you feedback on your open

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,869
source project don't really have any

00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:58,359
Twitter followers Matthew my

00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:00,609
recommendation would be to find the

00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,589
people that are likely to use your open

00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,570
source project or that could benefit

00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:06,670
from using your open source project and

00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,400
connect with them where they are whether

00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,830
those are in virtual meetups or actual

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,020
meetups when we have those again if

00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,810
there are existing user communities or

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,860
people who might benefit from that

00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,810
project

00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,400
and that would be a good place to start

00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,890
go to where your users were likely to be

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:32,180
because your users are likely to be the

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:35,180
source of your contributors if you don't

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,480
have access into communities where there

00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:41,360
are users who might need this go to

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,370
conferences like this and go out into

00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,750
the general networking sessions and look

00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,250
to connect with people and just say hey

00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,640
I have an open-source project that I

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:51,830
need to get feedback on and see if you

00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,410
get some I'm sure you will get some

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,210
folks who are willing to at least take a

00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,930
look at it and give you a sense there

00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:02,630
and thank you David for the confirmation

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:08,360
open at open source comm on the blog

00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:10,610
post there and there's one more from -

00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,140
from Kevin and Alyssa Kevin have I heard

00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,390
stories about it being easier or harder

00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,820
for people and non tech companies to get

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:20,210
permission to contribute to open source

00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:23,120
I can't speak specifically because none

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:30,290
of it I can't recall a specific story

00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:33,530
but anecdotally the non tech companies

00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:36,530
tend to either be it seems like it runs

00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,850
hot or cold either they don't understand

00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,440
what it is and so they don't care or

00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,720
they don't understand what it is so they

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,860
say no it kind of depends on the level

00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,810
of risk sort of allergy that the

00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:52,820
individual company has if it's a

00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:55,450
financial services company or sort of

00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:58,160
other high-risk companies there are

00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,130
answers that I would say kind of tend to

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,100
default to know if it's a design company

00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:08,000
then they likely are not to care so much

00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:10,730
I think it really varies on who it is

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,130
that you're working for and Alyssa you

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:16,930
asked what's a great open source

00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,930
contribution you made at work

00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:27,270
a great one I don't know the the most

00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,380
recent thing the most recent poor

00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:33,660
requested that I submitted will took a

00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,329
form that was hard to find for the to do

00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:39,150
group and made it easier to find in the

00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:43,410
repo where we keep them it is the kind

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:45,150
of thing that is like it's it's not

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:49,140
worth shaking it's not groundbreaking

00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,180
it's not like super innovative but it's

00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,210
going to make this for me easier for

00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:56,460
other folks to find who need it later

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,200
and it didn't take very long and it was

00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:04,230
just kind of an example of a little

00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:05,460
thing that that was easy to do open

00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,960
source contributions don't have to be

00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,079
big a lot of the really valuable ones

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:14,069
are just small oh and Justins here

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,660
oh and Vicky says my whole job is a

00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:17,550
great open source contribution and

00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,710
you're making me blush

00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:22,560
thank you so much for your kindness and

00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:24,960
thank you everybody for joining I will

00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,250
hang out here for the next few minutes

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:34,560
and then I'm gonna jump over to the

00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:36,990
indeed booth I feel like almost I should

00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,119
ask people to put next to their names if

00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,609
I if I know them or if they work with me

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:54,630
or for me or if they're friends because

00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:57,089
thank you all it looks like questions

00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:01,760
have dried up here any final questions

00:48:57,089 --> 00:49:01,760
before I drop off this session

00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,040

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,470
talk and that was really exciting to see

00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:16,300
glad some of you found it useful happy

00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,359
