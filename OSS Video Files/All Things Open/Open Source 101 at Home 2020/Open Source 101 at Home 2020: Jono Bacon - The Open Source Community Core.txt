[Music]

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,830
all righty Thank You Todd I hope

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,220
everyone's doing well

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,800
welcome to the the orbiting bacon Space

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,560
Station I hope you're all safe and well

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,170
wherever you may be so I'm thrilled to

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,970
be here I absolutely love the work that

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,279
Todd and the team do I love all things

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,990
open it's a real bummer that we're we're

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,420
not going to be there in person in in

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,680
Austin today but it's so awesome the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,510
fact the fact that we're all here to get

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,059
together virtually is the the truest

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,160
essence of community so I'm gonna talk

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,600
today for about 15 minutes and you don't

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,660
have to know a lot about open source to

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,219
get a lot out of this but every one of

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,649
you is gonna influence a community in

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,390
some way you may join a community you

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,800
may start a community it doesn't really

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,960
matter and I think this will this will

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,820
be very very relevant to you so it was a

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,980
little bit of backstory I was raised in

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,020
a place in northern England it was very

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,730
boring and it was very picturesque okay

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,379
it looks a little bit like this and when

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,780
I was growing up I heard the same thing

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,280
over and over again people don't really

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,110
know their neighbors like they did back

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,330
in the good old days my parents my

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,340
grandparents everybody waffled on and on

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,619
about how this sense of community was

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,330
was kind of dying and leaving and this

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,280
wasn't my experience you know when I was

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,560
like 18 or 19 years old they looked like

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,090
this this is a picture a friend of mine

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,909
Stewart and I dug up while at the pub

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,590
just before the coronavirus and I

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,820
started a website called Linux UK and

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,280
which looked a little bit like this and

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,290
this was designed to kind of get people

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,240
in the UK together this was back in 1998

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,140
and it's just excited about meeting

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,030
other open-source people went to

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
university started a Linux user group

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,930
called Wolverhampton Linux user group

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,000
and then met some people there and got

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,070
interested in the project called KDE so

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
organized a booth down at a conference

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,450
in London you can see the you know

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,549
printed out bits of paper and iron-on

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,460
decals and t-shirts and things like that

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,780
and then down that that conference ended

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,790
up bumping into a couple of guys in the

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,619
pub who started a magazine called Linux

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,939
format magazine and I said to them do

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,129
you mind if I write an article for you

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,360
and they said sure but if it's terrible

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,020
we weren't publish it which seemed like

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,989
reasonable terms so anyway I started you

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,160
know started talking of

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,900
start talking about a place that just

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,300
opened up near where I live called open

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,830
advantage which provided free training

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,180
consulting people who were upskilling

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,489
into open source who used to work in

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,140
factories and manufacturing and that led

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,730
me out to go and fly around the world to

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,550
meet people at conferences I got

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,920
interested in the genome project and

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,750
kicked off a project called jocose sure

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,580
and then that led to building a

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,900
community around that particular project

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,110
the whole reason why I'm going through

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,840
this condensed biography is because when

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,860
I kept hearing this people don't know

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,780
their neighbors like they did back in

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,930
the good old days I wasn't seeing it I

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,910
was seeing this amazing group of people

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,130
all over the world who come together and

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,380
this is what's so exciting about this to

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,290
me is that communities out there and

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,480
it's thriving this right that what is

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,310
happening right now is a good example of

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,319
this and what this is is this

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,049
international network of minds who come

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,090
together to share experience and talent

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,579
and expertise and open source I think is

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,349
a wonderful example of this so you know

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,970
it's not just my experience we've seen

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,609
the growth of Wikipedia we've seen

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,870
open-source dominating every possible

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,750
industry from the cloud to

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,910
infrastructure to devices we've seen the

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,470
maker revolution happen you know many of

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,090
you will have kids who are making things

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,459
who are creating interesting little

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,720
inventions which is unlocking their

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,220
creativity we've seen the

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,590
democratization of funding with

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,660
crowdfunding and it's not just these

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,340
areas we've seen Salesforce and sa

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,739
people communities of over a million

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,889
members harley-davidson over 1,700 local

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,100
user groups leggo allow their community

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,569
members to make LEGO sets I gem bring

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,180
gamers together hitRECord

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,019
allows people to work together on

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,750
productions that many of which are shown

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,510
being shown at Sundance so there's so

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,000
much community excitement going on out

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,639
there and to me it gets back to this

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,959
network of minds is that with stronger

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,489
together is that when we unlock that

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
potential we can really get out there

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,630
and do almost anything but to me what's

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
really exciting about this is open

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,019
source this is what got me into it and

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,599
this to me is one of the finest examples

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,519
of what makes community so powerful and

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:22,680
one of the reasons why open source works

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,960
so well is that we're able to get

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,000
together and share the same material you

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,020
know like there can be somebody I'm here

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,319
in California

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,120
on the orbiting space station and there

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,310
may be someone out there in in Warsaw

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,599
who and we could both quake working

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,090
exactly the same project we can have the

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:41,729
same content the code the documentation

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,020
we can coordinate online events now we

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,300
have the ability to work together

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,319
effectively so in this session I want to

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,150
walk through some of things that I've

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,830
learned over the course of my career

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,759
that I think are relevant to any of you

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,960
who are getting interested in

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,270
communities it doesn't matter whether

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,060
you want to set up a local group about

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,470
open source in your town or whether you

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,030
want to start an open-source project or

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,099
join an open-source project it doesn't

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,229
require having a ton of experience these

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,569
are three things I think it's important

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,280
for you to bear in mind the first one is

00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:11,159
that the best experiences of journeys

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,550
okay if any of you have been at Disney

00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,380
World

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,030
when you show up and you you park your

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,409
car and you buy your tickets and that

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,449
you go in through the gate and then they

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,099
guide you around the park and how the

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,389
restaurants open and serve the right

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,419
amount of traffic everything is

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,250
carefully curated if you look at great

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,569
restaurants from how you show up and

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,949
they pour you water and they bring you

00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,719
the menus and then you order from the

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,069
menu and they bring you in at the right

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,080
cadence everything is carefully

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,979
orchestrated video games are another

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,990
example

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,610
I just bought Luigi's Mansion 3 for my

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,860
son recently and we both play in it

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,740
the first couple of levels are very very

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,300
carefully designed for you to pick up

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,370
the controls and feel a sense of

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,719
accomplishment here's the thing

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,130
your community needs to be more than

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,779
this it needs to be more than just a

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,849
github repo it needs to be more than

00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,340
just a meetup page it needs to be more

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,830
than just the basics of you being on the

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,569
Internet it needs to be the whole

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,270
experience in how we build that journey

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,419
out now you may be thinking okay jonno

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,949
how on earth do we do that well this is

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,060
how I would recommend it this is one of

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,219
the things Todd mentioned I got this

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,539
book people power this is how I would

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,550
recommend you approach it and I covered

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,830
this in the book the first thing we do

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,210
is we understand who our audience is you

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,029
know do we want to attract developers

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,759
event organizers do want people to use

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,159
our software or come to our events and

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,419
then we design an onboarding experience

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,979
that's really simple for them to do

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,719
something that's valuable for them so if

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,000
they want to join your community and ask

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:34,710
a question and get an answer that's an

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,300
onboarding experience if they want to

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,589
contribute their first bit of code to an

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,539
open-source project that's their

00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:41,219
onboarding experience the point is is

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,820
that we simplify this because you can go

00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:43,740
into as

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,020
much promotion as you want in the whole

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,580
world and if they all come through the

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,620
front door and no one knows how to get

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,630
started then there's kind of screwed

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,860
okay so think about what are the five or

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,600
six steps that they need to go through

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,650
from learning about your community to

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,980
how they do something that's valuable

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,540
for them now what we do is we break them

00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,090
into three phases of a journey

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,130
I call them casual regulars and core so

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,870
when you're casual you kind of knew you

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,300
don't really know what's going on just

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,380
think about when you first joined

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,930
open-source 101 today you didn't really

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,820
know anyone this hold new platforms a

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,230
little bit weird and kind of you're

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,420
unusual it's cool but it's different

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,740
right there's a lot of insecurity a lot

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,660
of people experience imposter syndrome

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,580
especially people in underrepresented

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,770
groups can especially find this a really

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,060
difficult phase to kind of get into so

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,830
we need to make this really simple for

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,940
them to get started in when people are

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,170
regulars this is where they've been

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,790
around for a couple of months and

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,080
they're hanging out and they've kind of

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,700
got to know people and then the core

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,590
members of the people who were just

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,600
super engaged they're like the people

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,750
who are just incredibly passionate about

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,460
your community so in the casual phase

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,070
you really want to focus on the access

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,360
and the relationships help people to you

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,220
know have pretty simple and effective

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,590
problem-solving be able to build

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,480
relationships effectively provide plenty

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,220
of training webinars and programs

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,140
instructional blog posts and other

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,450
different bits and pieces maybe some

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,670
formal mentoring this is really powerful

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,490
to help simplify how people settle into

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,660
the pool that is your community now for

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,070
the regulars this is all about

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,050
collaboration you've got these people

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,300
who are pretty excited about how all of

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,920
this stuff works and what you want to

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,050
make sure is that you can unlock their

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,300
creativity you know encourage people to

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,240
maybe set up new projects and new events

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,070
matchmake people to work on new areas of

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,570
your community you know for example

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,340
let's say you're running a local group

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,930
in your town and there's some there's

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,130
some community members who live in

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,720
another town it's nearby it may be

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,120
encourage them to organize another group

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,790
there have competitions and hackathons

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,020
it's about enable them enabling them to

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,240
have the confidence to go and do these

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,160
interesting things and then for the core

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,039
people this is about tapping into their

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,840
wisdom here's a tip right no matter what

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,210
you're doing with your building products

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,130
or software or building communities the

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,900
answers to all of your questions live in

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,820
the heads of your audience okay and we

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,590
want to tap into that and our core

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,450
members have got so much expertise

00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,580
I can share so share regular one-on-one

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,170
sessions with them involve them in the

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,060
design and the planning of your future

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,440
community projects bring them into a

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,970
channel where they can discuss these

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,420
things it's all about unlocking that

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,640
creativity so this is the journey that I

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,110
recommend and one of the things we do to

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,640
keep people moving forward is we apply a

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,680
series of incentives which I'm going to

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,060
get to a little bit later on but what I

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,010
do want to focus on before I get to that

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,690
is the second area and this is that we

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,130
designed for people right it's easy

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,810
especially in open sorcerous to talk

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,420
about technology and computers the

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,950
machines and all this kind of stuff but

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,570
at the end of the day there's a human

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,790
psychology that we need to understand

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,210
and the way it looks a little bit like

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,800
this

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,140
is that when you join any community or

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
any group and this happened today first

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,680
of all you have access to it you need to

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,120
give access to go and participate then

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,620
when you start contributing and doing

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,630
some interesting things you kind of get

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,310
a sense of how it works it starts

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,870
building some self-respect that you you

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,130
can figure this stuff out that you can

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,560
understand this new world that you're

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,000
entering into when this happens over and

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,290
over again you keep contributing you

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,180
keep building that self-respect it

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,040
builds a sense of dignity and this means

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,720
that you really feel like you've got

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,520
some worth in this community that you're

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,050
a part of and then that gives you the

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,880
confidence to have an impact that means

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,670
you can think bigger and you think of

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,050
new and interesting ideas and propose

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,150
things that haven't been done before

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,340
without worrying about you know people

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,720
kind of knocking you down when this

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,980
happens over and over again it builds a

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,200
sense of belonging and this is the

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,450
ultimate treasure in any community any

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,670
workplace any family is that you feel

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,410
part of something and that if you were

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,320
to go where you'd be missed okay

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,830
the the key thing here is access and

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,810
belonging

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,040
we start with access make sure people

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,990
have got equal access to join your

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,430
community and focus on all the different

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,530
pieces that they need to go through to

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,330
get to that point of belonging always be

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,710
focused on this human psychological

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,170
element cuz if you forget this you're

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,150
just basically tweaking software okay

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,530
the tricky thing here is that there are

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,150
millions of things out there that can

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,250
distract us away from people coming to

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,380
your communities this is an actual photo

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,270
taken inside of human brains this is how

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,090
much junk we've got in our brains right

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,590
the tiger cake good example so what

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,200
makes people want to try something new

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,240
it's a it's very simple is that it

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,290
provides clear value is it does

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,180
something really relevant and

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,280
interesting to them so for example

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,480
Firefox right that make it very clear

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,820
why you should use their Brad

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,590
these are the benefits of using it the

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,060
cloud native computing foundation makes

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,740
it very clear about what they do to

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,990
bring value to the infrastructure space

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,480
okay so that's one things really

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,560
important to focus on what is the value

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,300
that someone's going to get out of your

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,680
community whether it's your group your

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,080
open source project or something else

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,060
and then the third thing that I want to

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,340
touch on here is incentives we are

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,470
assuming being really incentivize Abul

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,940
and we're all guilty of this right we

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,190
collect airline while we used to collect

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,990
I'll airline matter miles until there

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,760
was no aeroplanes anymore

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,590
we get reddit karma we collect these

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
little stamps on coffee cards when you

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,070
get your tenth stamp you get free coffee

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,020
we collect video game trophies and

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,080
badges and Fitbit in places like that

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,580
and what's awesome about this is that if

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,260
we if we see something that's

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,700
interesting we're willing to work for it

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,620
and the reason for that is that

00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,940
psychologically we're hunter-gatherers

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,560
right is that we're always wanting to

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,180
make sure we can protect ourselves and

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,890
have enough sustenance and food and all

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,420
that kind of stuff and this is just

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,740
wired into our brains because our brains

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,840
have really haven't add an upgrade in a

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,090
long time now there's two ways in which

00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,380
you can approach these incentives one is

00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,750
called stated and one is called

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,760
submarine so for the stated incentives

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,800
what you do is you say if you do this

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,260
thing you will get this thing okay so

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,270
for example github as a game off and

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,690
this is where if you come participate in

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,640
the competition you will get the prizes

00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,960
in in the competition hacker one has got

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,730
a leaderboard where if you go and

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,500
participate in it you may get particular

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,780
rewards based upon their the reputation

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,570
that you've generated many of you may be

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,710
familiar with Stack Overflow if you do a

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,630
certain thing you get one of these

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,150
badges such as if your question is

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,840
favorited by 25 people you get the

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,000
favorite question badge so I think

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,650
wiring into your community lots of these

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,140
specific things okay give very clear

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,820
incentives that if you do this great but

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,650
if you do this great work or if you

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,660
demonstrate the behavior that we want to

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,970
see you will be rewarded in some way and

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,560
this doesn't have to be swag it can be

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,020
just a thank you it can be public

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,390
recognition it's more about the the

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,750
incentive and the reward and the

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,670
recognition the other type of the other

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,780
type of incentive here is what I call a

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,070
submarine and these are kind of the

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,960
sneaky cousin these are the most fun

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,580
wants to put together and essentially

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,990
what you do is you use computers to

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,330
design sorry to

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,220
to detect when someone's done something

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,070
that you want to happen and then you

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,810
reward them in a very human way so to

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,420
give you an example one of things I

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,280
often do with my clients is when they

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,500
reach a particular trust level in the

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,390
platform called discourse we recognize

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,520
them publicly we say thank you for their

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,400
amazing contributions we highlight them

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,920
we often send them a swag kit and it's

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,420
because they've they've contributed

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,280
consistently to a particular point that

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,350
we've measured another example of this

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,460
is our friends are open source calm you

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,870
know when people have contributed a

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,190
certain amount of content to their

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,440
website they will send people swag

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,880
matter most will send people mugs with

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,320
their name written on it when they

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,450
submit their first contribution and

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,910
another example of this at open source

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,440
calm is when people have contributed a

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,170
lot they'll actually fly people out to

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,600
Raleigh where they'll join the day of

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,920
meetings to work on open source or

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,750
common what it means and how it can be

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,160
grown but they'll also get to go to all

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,510
things open and they'll get to meet

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,920
people like Jim Whitehurst who was the

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,610
CEO of Red Hat and is now the president

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,300
of IBM this network of human of minds is

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,950
amazing

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,840
okay and we're only just beginning to

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,100
tap into the potential here so I'd

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,300
encourage you to go and think about

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,460
these things and what it means for your

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,590
community and then just to very briefly

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,850
