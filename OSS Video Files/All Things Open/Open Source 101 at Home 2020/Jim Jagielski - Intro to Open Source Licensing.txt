	Intro to Open Source Licensing

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Jim Jagielski, Uber

Abstract: Open Source licensing can be a tricky and confusing topic. In this session you will learn about the goals and intents of open source licensing, the main differences between various open source license types, and which license is best for your open source project. Whether consuming or contributing to Open Source, you need to know and understand basic open source licensing requirements.

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:18,330
okay everyone so welcome to open source

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:21,330
licensing open source licensing 101 Jim

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,760
Jagielski here Jim jag is my twitter

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,630
handle so I definitely feel free to

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,880
follow me a little bit about myself if

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,619
you have heard of me you most probably

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,190
aware of my reputation in the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,890
open-source community with the Apache

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,070
Software Foundation which I co-founded

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,469
and served as director another comes

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,620
like good stuff for a long long period

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,180
of time I still consider myself a

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,890
developer at heart

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,280
and I still contribute to a whole bunch

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,730
of open-source projects and to pay the

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,489
bills

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,660
I am the open source program officer

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,340
manager at uber which is a fantastic

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,939
company back I just joined this is going

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,890
to be my second week there at at at uber

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,479
so anyway first things first is get this

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,450
clear I'm going to be talking about

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,740
licensing but I am NOT a lawyer so

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,310
please don't think that this is a

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,340
complete guide to everything legal my

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,740
goal in this is to provide some really

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,259
good basic information for developers to

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,619
figure out what licenses are best what

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,960
licenses do what the conditions are what

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,680
the requirements are but certainly in

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,439
all cases double check with actual legal

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,290
authorities I would say like about 95

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,659
percent of this is directly applicable

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,420
but it's the 5% that you would it be

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,189
careful with so definitely make sure to

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,119
check with somebody if you have any

00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,630
kinds of questions out there so why why

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,850
spend this time talking about open

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,490
source licensing well first of all is

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,729
that and this is something that maybe

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,580
many people may not know copyright is

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,790
the default as soon as you create

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,950
something

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,140
as soon as you publish something it is

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,659
under copyright and really no one has

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,700
permissions or very very limited

00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,370
permissions on what they can do with it

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,900
so say for example something is up one

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,299
github but it doesn't have an

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,480
open-source license associated with it

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:34,180
well you really don't have a lot of

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,060
permissions legal permissions to be able

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,030
to you might be able to copy it but you

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,040
can't modify it you can't use it you

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,290
can't do all kinds of things with it

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,170
because it is under copyright copyright

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,989
is something that needs to be actually

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,909
license or given away so just a very

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,620
fact of promoting it you're putting it

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,290
up on a public site does not remove

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,450
copyright restrictions it's got to be

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,790
under a open-source license for it to be

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,940
an open-source license a second way

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,099
open-source is everywhere I'm gonna try

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,440
to holding up the camera sorry about the

00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:12,159
shaking open-source is everywhere you

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,530
can't be inside of IT or anything that

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,030
touches IT nowadays without there being

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,160
some open-source

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,389
you know associated with it so since

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,120
you're constantly going to be touching

00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:24,609
open-source since you will constantly be

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,760
interfacing with open source and since

00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,680
in many ways the license is the main

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,199
touch point between the open source and

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,660
you you really need to worry about it

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,239
because the license determines how you

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,709
can use it how you can reuse it and how

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,019
you can distribute it and not

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,840
understanding these conditions not

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,840
understanding the requirements means

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,079
that you are taking on some level of

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,900
risk maybe not a lot of risk depending

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,370
on what you know if license are and the

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,650
other people that you're using it from

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,079
but it's still something you really want

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,859
to you know make sure this is all good

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,959
so definitely this is the reasons why

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,799
now some of the licensing goals is to

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,819
basically ensure which parts remain

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,310
open-source and we'll talk about that a

00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,859
little bit later at one another goal

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,109
that people use when they're creating an

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:19,239
open-source license are determining what

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:22,780
open-source license makes makes the most

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,570
sense is to maintain some level of

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,150
control or authority

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,890
over there code and the direction of the

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,330
open-source project itself and again

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,010
we'll talk about that a little bit later

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:38,260
on another reason is to provide some

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,600
sort of common implementations for open

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,580
standards and open protocols and you

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,300
choose the correct lope up and source

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,300
license

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,180
depending on how ubiquitous you want

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,700
that standard to be how I'll Universal

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,620
you want this protocol to be if you want

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,510
it somewhat more restricted then you go

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,940
in a different kind of license outside

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,780
there what we've been seeing a lot

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,180
nowadays is that there are commercial

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,790
and community market places for a lot of

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,790
this open source code out there and so

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,800
being able to build a community or

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,250
commercial marketplace around this open

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,680
source project creating an ecosystem

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,170
around those open source projects

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,420
figuring out how to monetize or

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,420
commercialize an open source project

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,330
these are all factors to consider when

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,060
you're talking about which license is

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,860
applicable and the goals available to

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,450
you in choosing a license out there now

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,580
let's talk a little bit about the the

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,700
concept the open source actually started

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,160
off as an offshoot of the free software

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,220
movement and in this particular case

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,070
it's free as in free speech not as free

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,210
as in free pre beer and this is the

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:58,990
reason why at least in English

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,490
free software has this I guess this idea

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,380
that you always have to say that you

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,470
only have to say that I'm talking about

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,750
the freedom aspect of the software not

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,670
that it's given away for free or there's

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,270
no money associated with it or something

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,310
like that

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,580
and so open source was a way of

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,860
reframing that idea such that you're not

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,680
always talking about that that

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,000
differentiation about what free means

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,830
for people who are free software

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,250
advocates and certainly free software

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,190
foundation software freedom is a moral

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:34,540
imperative it is something which the

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,490
license is designed to really ensure to

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,740
really make sure that this is always the

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,389
case that software should be

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,819
in the same way that people should be

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,880
free and so you'll see that a lot of the

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,340
free software copyleft lesson light

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,210
licenses out there it's all about

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,550
ensuring this level of software freedom

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,550
now for something to be under the the

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,870
free software foundation there are four

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,430
basic freedoms that must be maintained

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,620
these are the the guidelines that

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,449
determine what is or is not a free

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,690
software license or really what the free

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,310
software movement is about now really we

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,960
can really think about free software and

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,569
open source is pretty much the exact

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,210
same thing in fact in many places you'll

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:24,310
see it talked about as false foss4g

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,479
where where sometimes even flossed

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,389
where l stands for a libre which is you

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,860
know spanish for free and freedom so

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,259
sometimes you'll see it as false or

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,860
floss it's just about this idea of this

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,150
concept of open source and free software

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,030
now for something to be considered an

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,479
open source it must be under an OSI

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,610
approved open source license OSI is the

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,460
open source initiative and they're

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,280
basically the gatekeepers of what is and

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:58,030
is not open source and they have an open

00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,539
source definition which is a less a list

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,599
of ten criteria that the licenses must

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,690
comply by license is much complied by

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,930
these ten criteria for OSI to approve

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,110
them as an open source license and

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:17,710
really there are a large number of open

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:22,180
source licenses out there at least 60 or

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,560
so counting up there certainly we're not

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,990
increasing the number of open source

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,110
licenses as we have been doing in the

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,180
hey gang but you still see open new open

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,860
source licenses getting approved but

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,860
it's getting harder and harder for them

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,630
to get it be approved so the Free

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:43,539
Software Foundation has four freedoms

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:47,560
OSI has ten criteria I kind of think of

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,600
it as basically promises and I think we

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,279
can actually distill it down to three

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,889
main promises that must be a

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,189
your consideration in open-source

00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:01,160
licensing the first is first of all

00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:05,269
let's just pretend for example that open

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,870
source and the code associated with open

00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:10,579
source are the same as cookies an Oreo

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,329
cookie for example and I'll be using

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:16,850
this quite a bit in later on so not only

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:19,040
is the code the cookie but also the

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,740
recipe in creating the cookie is the

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,410
same as the actual source code in

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,589
creating the software program

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,029
I think the first promise that people

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,850
make when you're using an open source

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:34,430
license is you're able to use that

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,490
cookie in any way you want to not only

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,980
the cookie but also the recipe as well

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,079
and normally of course what you do with

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,350
a cookie is you eat it that's the normal

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,059
expected use but you can also make a

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,459
gingerbread house cookie and that's an

00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:52,249
acceptable use there are no restrictions

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,309
on how you use the actual cookie itself

00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,990
but also how you use the recipe you can

00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:01,430
do anything you want to do with that

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,589
recipe so by making it allow people to

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,750
use the recipe and the cookie in any way

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:07,730
that you want to is one of the promises

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,069
that's inherent inside of any source

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,629
open source project and then a open

00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:17,600
source license the other promise is the

00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:19,779
ability to modify both the cookie as

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,980
well as the recipe just so you have a

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:26,899
traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,870
well if you weren't able to modify it if

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:32,870
you weren't able to like add nuts to it

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,519
or more sugar or more brown sugar or

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,889
something like that to it well that

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,629
would be a pretty useless recipe because

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:42,079
you weren't able to modify to your

00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:44,600
conditions open source allows you to

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,029
modify it any way you want not only can

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,519
you modify the recipe itself to fit

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,249
whatever needs you have but you can also

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,230
modify the result in cookie in the same

00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:57,709
way that you can use an existing open

00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,379
source program and use it as part of

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:02,509
your development staff as use it as part

00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:06,040
of your commercial stack if someone

00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:09,290
originally excuse me wanted to you

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,510
drupal that's just as a CMS system for

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,930
example but you wanted to use it for

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,120
some other unique usage you are able to

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,400
do so so even though the original design

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,980
for a software program may be for a

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,170
specific requirement open source allows

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,250
you to modify that use for anything else

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,500
and thirdly is the ability to share to

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,710
share your modifications to share the

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,610
resulting cookie to share all aspects to

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,800
it and the great thing about sharing

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,360
software is that it's not a zero-sum

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,000
game in the same way that you're able to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,550
you know share you know imagine every

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,530
time you share the cookie it magically

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,120
regrew itself so in this situation

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,070
there's two girls they're sharing half a

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,440
cookie but it's not that way when you're

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,030
sharing code because you're not

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,710
diminishing we're decreasing the amount

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:06,370
of cookie goodness that you have it's

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,310
it's it's you're not giving anything up

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,410
by exercising that ability to share so

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,480
you're able to actually share the

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,510
software itself the program itself but

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,360
also the original recipe as well as the

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,460
modifications associated with that

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,010
recipe out there and I think in general

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,110
you know when you start to boil down the

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,360
open source definition and the freedoms

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,630
of those free software movement it's all

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,080
about using modifying and sharing source

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:39,070
code and resulting programs associated

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,570
with that source code out there

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,580
so let's actually talk a little bit

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:48,680
about the licenses per se and again

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,680
we're gonna you know we're gonna carry

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,750
on this this this analogy with

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,510
protecting the cookies and code or the

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,640
exact same thing because it helps us get

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,900
around some of the confusion some of the

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,420
complexities associated with that now

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,600
the first type of open source license

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,690
out there is what I call the the give me

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,180
credit kind of open source license these

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,700
are also called permissive licenses and

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,010
most probably the three most popular

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,070
open source licenses

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:26,000
that comply with that are the the apache

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,280
license v2 the MIT license and the BSD

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,460
license and the criteria for this

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,950
particular license says that you can do

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,960
basically anything you want to do with

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,020
the software and the project that's

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,000
under this open-source license as long

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,420
as you give us credit as long as people

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,840
are aware that you use an open-source

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,030
license a software project and you give

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,640
them the URL or the pointers to where

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,610
they can download that license we don't

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,260
care what you do with it you can

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,260
shrink-wrap it and make it a proprietary

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,480
product that's fine you can go ahead and

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,670
add additional functionality and your

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,370
capabilities to it and either choose to

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,010
share or not share those those

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,290
modifications that's all fine there's no

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,380
problem at all so it really means that

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,900
as much as possible there are few

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,210
restrictions to use this software

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,130
project as there are and I'm going to a

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,100
little bit more examples in details

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,950
associated with that but basically the

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,120
idea again is that there is give me

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,680
credit that's all you need to worry

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,200
about is give me the credit for the

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,330
open-source project and what you want to

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,790
do with it after that point is all free

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,600
and clear it's all up to you no research

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,670
means that all the second type are the

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,240
though we copyleft license and the

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,630
effect the eclipse public license and

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,570
the the lesser GPL the LGPL are the two

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:57,710
best examples of that and that basically

00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:02,120
says that if you're using my software

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,850
project the software that's under a we

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,820
copyleft license then you're able to do

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,120
anything you want to do with that with

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,360
that project but if you actually fix the

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,270
source code if you actually modify or

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,150
improve the code that you're using

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,670
that's under it we copyleft license then

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,050
once you start distributing that larger

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,450
work once you start distributing

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,910
something which is based on or built on

00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,510
that software license well you need to

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,220
provide a copy of those fixes back to

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,709
the larger

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,250
community now the upstream community may

00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:40,990
choose not to accept those fixes but you

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,290
need to make sure they're available out

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,899
there

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,259
the idea being behind it is that hey you

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,420
know you're using this software project

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,490
I want it to be open source if you're

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,319
improving it well it just makes sense

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,060
that the other community members who are

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,620
using this recopy less software project

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,379
benefit from the improvements and the

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,980
and the modifications that you've made

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:08,199
anything else you do to the larger work

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,810
that combines that I don't care what you

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,689
do but if you improve what I shared with

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,149
you you need to share those improvements

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,009
with the larger community as well and

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,709
that is basically the condition in the

00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:24,220
requirement of the of the weak copyleft

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:27,990
licenses out there this was originally

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:31,060
made for a software project which were

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,459
you know libraries you know bolted on

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,709
libraries that added some specific

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,120
definitive functionality inside there

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,269
and that's the reason why a lot of

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,809
people think the the L in the LGPL

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:49,269
stands for library instead of a somewhat

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:51,850
more permissive a GPL you know a library

00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:53,980
out there but that's really not the case

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,000
but if you think of libraries is sort of

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,040
like one of the reasons or the

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,220
rationales behind this you would be that

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,370
very very far off the mark the third

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,230
type of license is what I call - give me

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,720
everything we have to give me credit to

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,299
give me fixes and this is the the give

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,409
me everything a standpoint a lot of

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:16,630
people call this a viral type nature of

00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,480
viral type license inside there the

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:24,699
strong copyleft license the GPL v2 v3

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,339
and the affero GPL models you know they

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,919
are you know in a said before in some

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,809
communities considered viral and even

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,970
though that kind of like gets the point

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,520
across it really does have a negative

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:41,530
connotation to it so I kind of like look

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,659
at it as sort of like imagine the the

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,929
software project that you're using it as

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:49,869
sort of like the canoe bee pollinating

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:53,259
your your software project your your

00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:55,210
larger distributed work so everything

00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:56,950
that it touches everything that it

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,059
pollinates everything that it improves

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,809
well that also now now needs to be under

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:07,360
GPL as well so as you see as the canoe

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:10,059
be right here swings back and forth and

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,490
pollinates these flowers they turn from

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:15,100
being under no license or whatever

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,950
license they were under to now be under

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,389
a GPL license so everything that the GPL

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,990
touches is now going to be forced to be

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:29,440
under a GPL strong copyleft license

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,600
again when you think about the the

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,350
guidelines and the goals of copyleft

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,710
being ensuring software freedom then

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,200
that really makes a lot of sense because

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,779
right now these flowers right here

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,299
on the on the left hand side because

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,269
they're not under a strong copyleft

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,970
license they might be under either

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:54,970
copyright or a weak copy left or even a

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,490
permissive license they're not free in

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,619
the in the in the way that the Free

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:03,610
Software Foundation wants them to be and

00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:06,309
so if you use something which is GPL in

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,909
those software projects then they must

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:14,409
become free also now I understand that

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:18,249
that that concept is a kind of kind of

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:21,159
weird mentality you know that's kind of

00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:23,470
you know hard to understand what that

00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:27,220
what that means and things like that and

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,950
that's where the cookie comes in really

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,039
really well so I'm gonna take this

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:36,639
cookie right here this Oreo cookie and

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,460
let's just imagine for a start second

00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:41,759
that this was back in the day when the

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,960
biscuit was just making the Oreo cookie

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,360
and it had an idea for it you know

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,139
basically you know two chocolate cookies

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,179
with the filling in the middle and they

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,789
didn't want to bother you know making

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,529
the the actual cookie itself or coming

00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,509
up with the rest of you for it

00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,179
now let's you know the special filling

00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:02,610
the white gooey

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,950
fantastic is this proprietary it's a

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,749
trade secret that is something that they

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,460
created themselves and they don't want

00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:10,769
to share that with anyone the cookie

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,679
it's a cookie it doesn't matter so you

00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:16,529
just say they went online and they found

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,019
a cookie recipe that was under say the

00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:22,559
apache license for example so the recipe

00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:25,200
for this cookie was originally an al v2

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,990
permissively license cookie so Nabisco

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,909
took it and they they say oh that's

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,669
great that'll work perfectly that'll

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:36,330
make our perfect Oreo cookie we'll use

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:38,369
that recipe but it was too crumbly every

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,919
time they tried to stamp you know the

00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,570
Oreo logo in it for example it would

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,480
crumble so they would need to make

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:49,200
modifications to that original recipe to

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,529
make it still crispy and fun and tasty

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,379
but able to hold that that's shaping

00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:58,139
really really well now because the

00:20:55,379 --> 00:21:00,990
original cookie recipe was under the alb

00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:03,869
to a permissive license there was no

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,730
reason for Nabisco to share those

00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:07,950
changes all they needed to say is like

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,139
hey if you like vittorio cookie that we

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,559
sell if you're interested in the

00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:16,529
original cookie this part cookie recipe

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,600
then go here but the modifications they

00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:21,899
made to that original cookie recipe

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,970
could still remain proprietary to

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,039
Nabisco they could share anything he

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,019
wanted to but he didn't have to if they

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,629
didn't want to and as far as the overall

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:33,029
cooking itself where of course that was

00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:35,159
something that was in the Bisco specific

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,830
no one else could copy that no one else

00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,009
could go in and you know simply by using

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,249
an open-source cookie recipe the entire

00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:48,629
cookie itself was still proprietary to

00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:50,580
Nabisco now the second example is let's

00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:52,980
pretend that instead of this recipe

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:57,240
being a permissive relicense cookie

00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:01,169
recipe it was an LGPL to give me fixes

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,289
type up open source license well in that

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,749
case whatever modifications they made to

00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,240
it would need to be shared back they

00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:11,129
would need to go and say we took this

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,970
original cookie recipe and here's the

00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:17,720
link to it but we also modified it

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,060
this way we added you know some

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,850
stabilizers in it and reduce the amount

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,130
of I don't know you know baking powder

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,430
or something like that and then we need

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,590
to make those those changes available to

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,410
everyone else so if they wanted to make

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,460
an exact copy of this this cookie itself

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:40,330
they could but the combination itself

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,760
was still proprietary new Nabisco and

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,010
certainly the the white gooey filling

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,740
that that you know delicious part that

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,290
everybody just you know eats eat that

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,720
recipe is still close source it's still

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:56,200
proprietary new to Nabisco no matter

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,850
what they have to do and share the

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,860
modifications and recipe for this that's

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,070
still secret there's no reason to share

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:10,520
that that's what the the wheat copyleft

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:16,610
says you have to do now let's assume

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:20,300
that this was under GPL gplv2 a strong

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:23,180
copyleft license well in this case yes

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,220
of course the modifications and the

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:30,080
changes to the recipe would have to be

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:33,350
shared with everyone but because this

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,550
combined cookie would not be anything

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,610
without this part of the cookie that

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:44,300
meant the recipe for the entire cookie

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:48,980
this derivative work this combined work

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:51,290
would also need to be under GPL which

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,600
meant that this wouldn't even be better

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:59,570
GPL but also the special I see the the

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,660
middle part of the Oreo cookie Nabisco

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,730
would have to release that shared secret

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,520
so you can see this is the reason why

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,520
and in many ways in many cases people

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,340
call it a viral nature it's because this

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,520
was GPL and because we're using this to

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,280
create this cookie the entire cookie is

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,890
now GPL and the entire cookie and the

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,200
recipe thereof has to be associated with

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,060
that and that's the reason why in a lot

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,090
of cases you'll see in corporate

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,720
environments

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,670
when you're talking about acceptable you

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,130
know incoming open-source projects

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,080
they're very very much okay with

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,750
permissive licenses because it doesn't

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,470
prevent them doing it but if you want to

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:47,760
build a project or build a product

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,590
related on an LGPL or a GPI related code

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,360
there are some conditions associated

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,600
with there's some concerns associated

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,270
with it and so with that in mind let's

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,070
start thinking about some of the ideas

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,140
associated with governance models and

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,190
how this actually affects the open

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,740
source projects that you're talking

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:09,930
about so back again with the slides and

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,390
there's our mr. GU Newby right there

00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,950
back to us so to start talking about the

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,720
governance and community models

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,060
associated with open source projects

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,120
because in many ways there is this

00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,610
natural alignment between open source

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,370
licensing and open source governance and

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:29,520
community the first type is what I call

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:34,170
a a walled garden kind of environment

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,120
and basically this says that you can use

00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,580
our software project you can take

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,420
advantage of all the freedoms and

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:44,970
liberties and criteria that's associated

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,940
under the open source license but it's

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,040
usually controlled by a single corporate

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,300
entity so you can look at it you can

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:57,000
enjoy it but as far as being an active

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,430
contributing member of that open source

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,350
community it really is tightly

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,110
controlled it's not really a

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,090
community-based open source project it's

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,380
a corporate based open source project

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,000
it's still an open source project

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,020
because it's under an open source

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,970
license but it really isn't as

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,630
collaborative as consensus-based as you

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:21,480
want as you would like now certainly

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:24,060
these are popular open source projects

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,550
for companies that want to commercialize

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,320
or monetize their open source projects

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,440
out there and so you'll see in a lot of

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,960
cases most of these walled garden kind

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,540
of open source projects are under a

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,700
strong copyleft license I'll usually be

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,470
under a GPL or a GPL because the

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,780
the entity that's releasing the

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,730
open-source project wants to release an

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,790
open-source project but they want to

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:53,510
have ultimate control and authority over

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:55,340
that and really ensure that no one can

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:59,630
use that open-source project that are

00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,940
using and and you know beat them at

00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:04,910
their own game you know or take

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,290
advantage so if anyone creates prob

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,300
you know and builds on top of their

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,190
open-source project because it's under

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,590
GPL they've got a release or Victor's

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,370
back and so any competitor would be at a

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:18,190
disadvantage in this type of environment

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:21,680
the other type of open source project

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,230
governance models out there is what's

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,710
called the benevolent dictator from life

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:30,140
model and this situation it really is

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,710
community focus it's it's really driven

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:36,290
by the community but there is at least

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,720
one person maybe a small handful of

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:42,050
people who have the ultimate control

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,080
ultimate authority on the direction

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:48,020
growth and future of the open-source

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,820
project they determine what patches get

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,040
get approve and what patches don't get

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,690
approved and you can think yourself

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,460
what's the difference between that and

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,320
the walled garden kind of environment

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,020
you know you still have this basically

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,720
this this dictator this central

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,880
authority determining where the project

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,700
goes and the difference between the

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,330
walled garden and the be DFL is that in

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,660
the BD FL the community has bequeathed

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:17,840
that power to the benevolent dictator

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,750
for life so even here the the you know

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,970
as Dennis's in monkey python and

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,640
searching for the holy grail supreme

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,680
executive power directs derives from a

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,110
mandate from the masses not from some

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,000
farcical or cracked ceremony the

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,970
community decides hey you know leanness

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,950
we trust you enough that we are

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,830
comfortable with you having ultimate

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,700
control ultimate authority on where the

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,360
linux kernel

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,480
goes so in the walled garden environment

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,460
the power is basically just assumed to

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,010
by entity where is the benevolent

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,179
dictator for life it is given by the

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:58,499
community to that

00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:00,269
did a benevolent dictator and that's the

00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:04,080
reason for the difference between those

00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:07,590
two in the be DFL environments there

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,679
really isn't a best fit or best case

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,440
open source licenses all open source

00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,110
licenses are viable you know models

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,119
associated with this and there really

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:21,179
isn't one that it's better for for

00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,830
anything else the final type is what I

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,779
called the the meritocracy

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,019
model I do understand that the

00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:31,619
meritocracy has you know in some places

00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:35,039
a negative connotation the idea of

00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:38,009
meritocracy is that your your

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,409
contributions are what matter is not who

00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:43,289
you are but what you do what you provide

00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:47,279
you know you don't gain merit you don't

00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:49,950
gain influence by who you are or you

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,960
know you know who pays your salary or

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,740
things like that it's what you provide

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,600
to the project and I certainly realized

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,240
that there are a lot of open source

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,269
projects out there that claim to be a

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,299
meritocracy where they really really

00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:09,779
aren't that their value of meritocracy

00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:12,809
has really really bad values such as you

00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:15,240
know a skin color race sexual

00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:16,980
orientation that's a that's a bad value

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,289
of meritocracy that isn't good

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,769
meritocracy meritocracy is really about

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:26,220
valuing all contributions and valuing

00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:28,350
all contributors so meritocracy is all

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,360
about creating collaboration consensus

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,029
building there is no single fault it's

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,389
all about the community itself driving

00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:39,179
the project and in many cases the most

00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:41,519
successful meritocratic open source

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,460
projects are those under a very very

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,039
permissive license the ASF the apache

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,080
software foundation every project is

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,600
under this mayor Craddock process

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,149
because we believe that for an

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,879
open-source project to grow and thrive

00:30:54,149 --> 00:31:00,059
you need a healthy and viable community

00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:02,789
and ecosystem about that and that's just

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:05,580
more naturally more rarely happens the

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,680
more permissive a license is because it

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,650
encourages all kinds of contra

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,330
Lucian's not only from individuals who

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,210
are volunteering their time you know

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,100
based on the side you know after work or

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,620
during the weekends but also from

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,540
corporate instructors incorporate that

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,150
to shift riveters who don't have to

00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,650
worry about any sort of viral nature's

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:30,480
with with copyleft concerns so I'm

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,210
coming pretty close to the end so a

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,160
couple things you know the AO p2 is

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,020
becoming increasingly popular and I

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,140
think the reason why is because unlike

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,860
other permissive licenses it has an

00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,830
explicit patent clause I think if you're

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,660
looking at looking into a an open-source

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,990
license and you want to get permissive I

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,510
would definitely choose the the ALV - if

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,770
that's a if that's what you want to do

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:57,660
open source is not a business model

00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,760
we've been seeing a lot of thud fear

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,410
uncertainty and doubt nowadays with

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,750
people claiming that the reasons why

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,480
their businesses and their revenues or

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,820
not what they should be is because bad

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,190
people bad players are using their open

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,440
source projects and not giving things

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,660
back when the open source license they

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,030
chose did not require them to give

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,640
things back they're exercising their

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,650
freedoms they're exercising the the

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,340
liberties that you gave them so open

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,900
source is not a business model per se

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,420
open source is a way of developing

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,930
software it's a model that you can use

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:36,000
to create a product and a project but

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,940
it's not a business model so let's make

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,130
sure that we don't you know try to

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,890
combine the two even though there is a

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,200
lot of overlap between them dual

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,980
licensing is now a thing it's generally

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,810
not a bad idea I mean it generally is

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,540
bad idea because it creates confusion

00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,730
out there but most of the people who are

00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:00,030
promotants or proponents of dual

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:02,430
licensing are those who want to create a

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,770
commercial viable business around it so

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,200
what they'll do is they will release

00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:10,130
their open source project under an

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,410
extremely strong copyleft one which has

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:16,140
which makes people you know somewhat

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,300
worried somewhat concerned they're not

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,930
exactly sure what the conditions are

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,000
what the touch points are am i giving

00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:26,090
lay the keys to the kingdom do I have to

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,740
release my proprietary stuff so the same

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,460
way that Nabisco would have to with the

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,420
icing if the cookie was copyleft and so

00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,610
what they'll say it's like you know

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,960
we're releasing it as as open-source so

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,210
you have an open-source project out

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,150
there it's under a strong copula

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,370
which will cause many people to not use

00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:46,610
it but if you're concerned about it we

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:49,040
will also sell you a proprietary license

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,480
that's usually most of the times where

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,270
you see don't like my cousin's thing out

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,760
there really avoid confusion and edge

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,740
cases as much as you possible and don't

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,830
forget about incoming contributor

00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,990
license when you're you know having an

00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,270
open source project make sure that

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:08,180
people understand that what you're doing

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,220
is also having contributions come in and

00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,860
make sure people are aware what those

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,260
incoming contributions are so you can

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,020
consume them inside of your open source

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,720
project some of the takeaways is that a

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,640
license is a tool there is not and

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,190
always right license there's not no

00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,290
one-size-fits-all type of license it

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,840
really depends on the kind of community

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,540
you're trying to build the trying what

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,940
you're trying to do as far as releasing

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,620
the open source project if if what

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,840
you're trying to do is create an open

00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,340
standard or an open protocol trying to

00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,800
get as many people to use that as

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,290
possible then a permissive license is

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,300
most probably the best fit if you're

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,610
trying to release software that you want

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,860
to create a business around then

00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:55,130
something which is more copy leftish

00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:57,920
makes the right sense take time you

00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,780
decide on the right license site don't

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,630
just you know you know when you're you

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,420
know creating a repo on github and MIT

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,100
is the first one on the pull-down don't

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,680
just pick that because it's easy take

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,290
some time because it can be incredibly

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,080
difficult to change licenses you know

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:18,860
midstream and a license will have a

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,390
direct impact on you know your adoption

00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,730
of the open-source project and how

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,590
people use it so always specify a

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,870
license and always make sure that you're

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,360
looking at why your open source

00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,400
installing and taking care of in

00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,130
choosing the correct license type out

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,150
there as Scott said earlier all this

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,950
will be

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,260
so all this information would be

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:45,020
available I also put the slides up on

00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:47,420
one SlideShare slideshare.net slash jim

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,360
jag i encourage you to follow me i'll be

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,830
here here virtually all day so if you

00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,640
have any questions please don't hesitate

00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:58,340
to you know to chat me to network me or

00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,860
like that this is my my email address so

00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,780
if after the fact say tomorrow or a

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,850
couple days later you want to you know

00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:08,170
get some clarification don't hesitate to

00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:12,740
to send me an email and things like that

00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:14,180
i think we've only got maybe she's two

00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,670
minutes left or something like that

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:21,160
which is certainly not enough time for

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,120
for Q&A but as i said before

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,310
definitely make sure that if you have

00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,950
any questions or concerns to reach out

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,790
contact me get my contact information in

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:34,280
there I really appreciate everyone

fierce so the very fact that you took

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,860
time out of your day when there were so

00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:45,980
many other great sessions going on to to

00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:50,030
see this session about such a dry boring

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,280
non techie subject as licensing means a

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:56,560
lot to me enjoy the rest of the day

00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,340
stay safe take care of yourselves and

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,970
