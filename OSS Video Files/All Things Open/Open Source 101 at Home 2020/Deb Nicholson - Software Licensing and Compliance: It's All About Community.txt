Description: 
	Software Licensing and Compliance: It's All About Community

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Deb Nicholson, Software Freedom Conservancy

Abstract: Software licenses seem a little intimidating, but they don't have to be! If free and open source software is a critical part of your business plan, then you owe it to yourself to learn a bit about licensing and compliance. This talk will help you learn about the various categories of licenses and how to make a plan for handling licenses correctly in your own work. Attendees will learn about:

- Free and open source software licenses and where they came from
- Common misconceptions about license compliance
- What resources are available for further learning

If you're just getting started then you probably have questions about who should be at the table for licensing discussions in your company or project, what your responsibilities are and how to approach license compliance work. Background on the communities that wrote the common free and open source licenses and how they use them will help you make better decisions and forge amicable long-term relationships with your upstream communities. The free and open source software community wants you to get this right, so there's a wealth of resources out there for you.

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,950
all right we are here for a software

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,960
license and licensing and compliance

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,670
it's all about community thank you all

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,550
for attending and supporting open source

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,720
101 I'm Jason hibbott some Red Hat and I

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,210
would just like to invite you to visit

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,859
our booth before the end of the day

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,269
after the session and check out our

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,070
open-source comm community and how you

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,869
can get involved if you're not familiar

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,149
with open-source comm it's a community

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,010
publication that accepts contributions

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,780
from people like you for example you

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,399
could write about a new technology or

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,829
new process that you learned today here

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,450
at open source 101 and how you plan to

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,300
apply it to your work your school or

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,760
your home our speaker today is a

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,379
published author on open source comm and

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,449
a former member of our correspondent

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,270
program and now I'd like to introduce my

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,270
good friend Deb Nicholson who will share

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,920
with you her deep expertise about

00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,930
software licensing and compliance so Deb

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,550
take it away

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,890
thank you so much Jason yeah that's

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,930
great let's imagine thunderous applause

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,850
or what's actually happening which is

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,670
the cat yawning in the background oh

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:17,340
well so I'm having a little bit of a

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,979
sneaky problem working with the slides

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:28,740
on while you all are on and I can see

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:32,840
your questions so just bear with me if I

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,439
don't get your questions right away so

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,439
let's see here

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:44,909
great okay so I'll check in periodically

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,979
back to you all to see if there are

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,689
questions in the chat but basically

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,079
we're going to talk about software

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,909
licensing and compliance I'm going to do

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,729
this is me I work at the Conservancy

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,439
which is the software freedom

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,020
Conservancy is a nonprofit organization

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,799
that amongst other things provides

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,920
expertise on licensing and and other

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,319
governance topics for community driven

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,910
projects that we housed at our fiscal

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,680
umbrella

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm not a lawyer so this isn't legal

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,940
advice and but I am I do know what I'm

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,060
talking about and hopefully you're not

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,330
going to have a lawyer you probably have

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,590
heard that lawyers are expensive so you

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,320
don't really want to have lawyers

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,140
explain to you the ins and outs of

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:39,750
copyright law so what we're still on the

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,850
same sorry about that I'm gonna just try

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,490
and reshare cuz we still didn't get the

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,490
slides great so we're at this slide now

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,160
does that work

00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:02,100
oh okay they're moving great okay cool

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,560
fun new technology learnings now I'm

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,150
gonna have to go back over okay anyway

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,820
so this is what we're gonna cover today

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,040
a legal history of past licenses

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,040
compliance who does it why do they do it

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,630
and how do they do it and since we're an

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,400
advocates in your organization a little

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,710
bit of our opinions on how they should

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,590
do it and then we'll do some best

00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,900
practices tips and resources and I will

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,740
leave some time for questions so that

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,180
folks can dig into the parts that we

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,810
didn't get into it says we're going to

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,540
try and cover a lot of stuff here today

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,600
so copyright law is well it was

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:44,970
originally designed for written stuff in

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,580
Ireland sometime back in 85 61 there

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,320
were two monks one had like a book that

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,030
the other one wanted and he asked like

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,490
could I please come over and copy this

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,650
book from you the first monk said nope I

00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,560
like being a special person that has the

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,760
only copy of this book so he came over a

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,709
month later to just visit and made a

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,790
secret copy in the middle of the night

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,530
and so the first monk found out about it

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,120
and got mad at the second monk

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,250
and they had to get the King of Ireland

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,220
to sort it out and the King said to

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,010
every cow belongs her calf and therefore

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,610
to every book belongs its copy and so

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,410
copyright was born so it was originally

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:30,300
intended to be

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:33,000
used for written materials it was I was

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,120
always intended to be for like books and

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,150
manuscripts and things like that and so

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,360
we but we kept using it because law

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,270
builds on other law we seem to really

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,540
dislike making new laws that are based

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:52,290
on nothing and so we sort of a Crete law

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,590
here so eventually because you write

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,250
music copyright also decided we decided

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,170
we would always have that apply there to

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,580
anything written at all so Maps scripts

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,530
plays all kinds of stuff and copyright

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,300
lasts for a really long time especially

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,600
when you consider how long it takes to

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,050
write computer code and how long it's

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,290
useful for but we did decide that we

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,570
would apply copyright to computer code

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,550
because you're right code and so that

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,140
means that it should go along with the

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,400
other written things at least that

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,900
seemed to have been the thinking at the

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,640
time

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:38,100
so licenses and software when we we did

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,020
decide to have copyright effect to be

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,350
the the first way that we would work

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,360
with code and then after that we we were

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,490
like oh maybe we made a mistake and we

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,640
should have put it in patents because it

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,290
performs a function so software code is

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,520
interesting in that it's written but

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,110
it's kind of more like a set of

00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,930
directions and directions like describe

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,950
a function or a process and that usually

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,690
is what we use for patents but patents

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,730
also change over time the originally

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,640
used to be only applied to physical

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:14,220
devices like a pin so like this ball on

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,200
the end of this pin to keep it from

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,169
poking a hole in your thumb it's very

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,540
clear that either a pin has a ball on

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:24,450
the end of it so it's that patented you

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,950
know ball pin or it doesn't have a ball

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,110
on the end of it and it's not the

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,800
patented ball pen so patents used to be

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,840
pretty clear and distinct and

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,360
understandable eventually we ascribe to

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,430
them also to pharmaceuticals what's in

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
those pills who knows could be anything

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,980
could be

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,730
patented thing and not patented thing we

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,350
don't know and then we also decided that

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,400
we would apply patents to business

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:54,750
models on a computer so then we had

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,390
patents on software as well so that that

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,280
led to this huge boom in patenting all

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:05,520
of the software we patented all the

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:08,430
things and we continued by doing you

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,400
know more and more patenting including

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:15,360
what we would call sorry where the page

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,610
go functional claiming functional

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,000
claiming means that you have identified

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,570
a problem and you plan to fix it on a

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,990
computer so you could say like hey I

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:31,980
would like to sell stuff with a database

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:35,190
and have it provide music for the person

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,840
that is purchasing the things you didn't

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,360
have to provide source code you didn't

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,280
have to provide a picture of devices or

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,290
computers or anything you just had to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,910
say I found a problem and I plan to

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,700
solve it with software and you would get

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,840
a patent so some of the leader licenses

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,870
that we're gonna talk about also

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,669
included patents which is sort of a mess

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,740
but they do all start with copyrights so

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,620
we're gonna go back to the beginning

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,460
the older licenses were all permissive

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,340
licenses so permissive means that's like

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,940
the MIT license here so permissive means

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,490
that hey you can have this code it

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:15,570
usually has something that says like

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:19,770
also don't sue me or pretend to be me

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,240
but don't sue me stuff we just kind of

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,050
say in the US about everything

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,550
regardless and the don't pretend to be

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,510
me is just covering your you know what

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,370
you're not supposed to impersonate

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,800
people anyway regardless of what the

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,479
license says so the MIT license is

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,570
pretty straightforward it just says that

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,390
like you know include this thing don't

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,150
sue us don't pretend to be us the BSD

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,700
license also fairly similar functionally

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,620
speaking again this is not legal advice

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,810
if you're gonna make like a you know a

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,660
two million dollar business decision

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,190
should probably like shave off a little

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,170
of that and get an actual lawyer but

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,990
this is a good background for you to

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,850
have and then the apache license which

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,010
is permissive it's longer so I didn't

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,840
include it here but it also includes a

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,480
patent clause so this is the first of a

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,760
more modern permissive license that says

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,400
like hey you can use our code don't

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,650
pretend to be us don't sue us but also

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,690
don't sue us for patent infringement and

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:22,260
this was later after the big bonanza of

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:25,500
patenting copyleft licenses which are

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,820
the most important for the for

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,250
compliance because we're going to talk

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,320
about compliance next compliance with

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,120
the permissive licenses is fairly simple

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,970
it's you know you just follow the rules

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,089
like and most of the ways that you would

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:45,210
enforce a permissive license are part of

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:47,700
trademark law or are part of fraud so so

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,070
when we talk about compliance with the

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,320
licenses we're usually talking about the

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,890
specialized area of compliance with

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,250
copyleft licenses and copyleft licenses

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,360
are sometimes known as share alike

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,500
people doing okay they have any

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,780
questions on this so far okay you're

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,710
doing great Deb you're doing great

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,560
actually and I'll just keep motoring

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,220
through I can't see the questions at the

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,220
same time as the slides so Cheryl okay

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,870
great great so Cheryl Lake so like say

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,180
you give someone a book and then they

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,280
read it to someone else that's basically

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,930
all share alike is like you shared

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,970
something with them they share with the

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,870
next person or cat as the case may be

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,640
and the licenses that are share alike

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,770
for content and the licenses that are

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,290
share alike for software are the same it

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,780
says I've put this out into the world

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,740
for everyone to use if you use it and

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,470
you redistribute it you must also put it

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,050
under a share alike license the part

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,060
that gets a little tricky is when we

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,200
start to talk about what is known as a

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,580
derivative work

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,709
Oh actually we're gonna talk about we

00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,120
copy left month and strong copy left

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:02,910
next so we copy left means like that the

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,780
share alike part only applies to a small

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,120
number of things that are like

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,070
either you have edited the actual code

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,070
that you were given and then

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:15,910
redistributed a new copy or you have

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,190
like written a library and so the weak

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,810
copy left stuff is too sort like it

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,940
means like if you make a substantial

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,670
change to the code that the person gave

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,680
to you under a copyleft license then you

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,360
have to also have that B copy left but

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,390
if you just write like an optional thing

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,460
that goes with a weak copy left codebase

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,730
then you don't have to share what you

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,840
wrote and this is strategic in places

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,120
where there is a proprietary competitor

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,370
to the thing that you wrote and you know

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,740
that you both want your code to work

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,210
with the same proprietary piece you're

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,390
trying to give people an open-source

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:55,660
option so that's where folks tend to use

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,310
the weak copy left there have not been a

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,670
lot of compliance actions around the

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,170
weak copy left stuff strong copy left is

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,050
where you tend to see more of the action

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,370
and that's these are the two main

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,440
licenses there are a couple others

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,510
there's a whole list of licenses at the

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,210
open source initiatives website but

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:17,860
these are the two main copy left strong

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:21,820
copyleft licenses and GPL well there's

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,730
surgeon too in version 3 but GPL v2 is

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,839
the code the code bases that are covered

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,170
there that you've probably heard over

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,500
the Linux kernel the get software there

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:36,030
is a ton of stuff and the Android stack

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,530
there's a I think a number of different

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,770
web platforms and things that are also

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:44,710
under GPL v2 so that's a pretty popular

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:46,240
copyleft license and the share alike

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,540
provision there is what we would call

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,780
strong so that means if if you add

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,380
something to a GPL either version 2 or

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,200
version 3 or an a GPL licensed codebase

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,790
you must provide the derivative work

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,880
like what you produce plus what the

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:08,500
other person produced all together under

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:12,310
a copy lefted license so compliance is

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,530
when you do what the what the license

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,290
has asked you to do and so complaint

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,710
sounds like it's it it sounds kind of

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,020
harsh because I

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,140
it's a legal term right like compliance

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,610
sounds you know it sounds like what you

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,320
want your dog to do when you take them

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,180
for a walk and it's time to go back in

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,830
and you're pulling and the dog doesn't

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,490
want to go and you want the dog to come

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,590
back to the house but in this case I

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,440
think it's more helpful to think of

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:43,220
compliance like a proposal rather than a

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,860
demand so that the proposal is hey if

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,690
you want to use this code and

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:51,890
participate in this community Commons of

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,660
software then you know also follow along

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,400
with the community norms and the

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,950
community norms are expressed through

00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,700
the licenses that's just how it is

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,850
because as we said software code ended

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:08,480
up being put under default copyright law

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:11,450
so that means it has to be expressed

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,810
legally so what is the derivative work

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,180
if you have found this piece of code

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,090
don't worry it won't bite

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,130
and then you add another piece of code

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,640
to it like your piece of code plus the

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,790
other piece of code is a derivative work

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,760
the piece of code plus ten other pieces

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,470
code is also a derivative work so the

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,840
Linux kernel is a great example of this

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,820
everything that works on top of and with

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,700
and is materially connected to the Linux

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,010
kernel is all under the same license as

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,820
the Linux kernel because of the way that

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,490
the gplv2 codebase works now you can

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,650
pull your piece back out and have them

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,360
each under their own licenses but once

00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,580
something has been published under a

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,310
specific license anyone can go back and

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,810
take that version of the code and use it

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,010
under the license that it was under so

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,670
Saffir can be complicated it's not

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,190
always just a stack or a whole pile of

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,140
you know equal parts so take like a

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,150
Reese's cup like you know you have

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,280
chocolate as separate and peanut butter

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,560
as separate and then together you have

00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,490
them in this cup form and that is a

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,290
derivative work

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,110
so if peanut butter was copyleft

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,750
licenses licensed then the Reese's cup

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,690
is now copyleft license but it might be

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,759
you know we've been making Saffir for

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:39,350
thirty years at least maybe 40 it gets

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,029
more complicated so what if you take

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,769
that original piece and then you stick

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,560
it into something else so this is still

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,720
a derivative work this is a derivative

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,959
work even though there's it's just got a

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,089
little Reese's Cup over on the side

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,860
these are all derivative works right

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,750
here so you've got like now you've added

00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,189
ice cream you add sauce you know

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,139
whatever you want to put in there

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,420
sprinkles whipped cream the whole thing

00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:07,430
together because one piece is copyleft

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:09,290
the whole thing is copyleft so and you

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,420
know and you can have it branded or not

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,879
branded but it doesn't change the fact

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,120
that the code and the idea at the heart

00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:23,860
of it was still licensed the way it was

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:27,199
originally licensed so let me see oops

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,670
so OOP and that way I don't have before

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,160
it I don't know what's going on with the

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,779
screen here today anyway so complete and

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,389
corresponding source so once you have

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,480
this whole thing that you have created

00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,509
like by taking different pieces of code

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,180
bases from all over the world or all

00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:47,779
over the repository and you have made

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:51,319
them into one thing one of the key

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,750
facets of a copyleft license is that you

00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,300
must be able to provide what's called

00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,560
complete and corresponding source so if

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,870
you have created this thing you're the

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,299
you know complete and will get a little

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,939
into what complete means in this sense

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,850
in a little bit but it includes the

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,709
dependencies so you know if even if you

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,689
didn't write the peanut butter you must

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,130
provide the source code for the peanut

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,390
butter so that is the current version

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,100
that you're using within your code base

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:26,120
and build instructions you can't just

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:28,250
you know it's like a recipe you can't

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,020
just have the ingredients out there

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,570
unless you're doing great British making

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,100
sure and it's a technical challenge for

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,809
software you have to provide the

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,490
building instructions when you are

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,230
offering complete and corresponding

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,940
source

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:44,090
so who does compliance to make sure that

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,830
these rules are being called

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,140
from a legal perspective anyone with

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,970
standing can do it and there are a

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,150
number of different ways to describe

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,130
standing but the legal the legal

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,530
definition for standing usually means

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:02,070
you can't be a person that is completely

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,470
unaffected and say like hey I just you

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,030
know maybe you're like I hate Microsoft

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,160
and I just want to sue them because it

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,530
would be fun or something we don't hate

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,590
them anymore it's fine but like if you

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,300
did you would still need legal standing

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,240
you can't just sue people because they

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,310
you know the idea of them bugs you you

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,520
have to have some sort of connection and

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,650
you have to be affected by the thing

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,260
that you're suing on so for compliance

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,780
work you like most of the compliance

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,230
work that gets done is by folks who hold

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,110
the copyright on the code base that is

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,940
not that has been incorporated into

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,800
somebody else's work and then that

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,620
person is not providing complete and

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:48,090
corresponding source so conservancy

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:50,310
where I work we do compliance we we had

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,740
the code we had the copyright on some

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,410
code that VMware was shipping with

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,480
within a you know a larger codebase and

00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,520
they were not providing complete and

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,050
corresponding source we wanted them to

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,900
provide the complete and corresponding

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,240
source that case is done they ended up

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,950
not doing the completing course for

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,240
corresponding source but instead taking

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:17,720
that code out the FSF does compliance um

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,400
I worked there back in 2004 or so and

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,800
for a few years and most of the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,750
compliance work we did then was sending

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,060
polite notes because people didn't

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,080
really understand compliance at all it

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,300
was

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,490
it was sort of made more sense that

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,060
companies were like I what's compliance

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,190
or what even is this and even I mean

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,930
just going back like 10 years there were

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,660
a lot of companies that were using copy

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,730
lefted code or open source code under

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,580
various licenses and their legal

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,710
department had no idea now we know that

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,660
it is a mistake to have your legal

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,130
department have no idea what's going on

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,410
in engineering and we don't do that

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,470
anymore but at that time it was a lot of

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,750
Education

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,660
the goal for compliance is an even

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,880
playing field so if you have written a

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,440
code base and or some sort of

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,600
functionality or since their library and

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,540
you put it out into the world you want

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,750
everybody to have equal access to it

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,059
so if you say to everyone who receives

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,850
your code that you want them to provide

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,490
source for any derivative work that they

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,860
provide to the public then you want that

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,010
to apply evenly to everyone it's not

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,370
fair if some folks come and take and

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:34,010
don't give back or share back and others

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,340
do so it creates this sort of a

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,440
disadvantage it's kind of like going to

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,480
somebody else's birthday party and not

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,179
bringing a present and eating all the

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:49,120
cake not cool anyway so the other

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:52,370
category of folks that do enforcement is

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,580
folks who sort of provide a little bit

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,830
of sort like code out there often dual

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,549
licensed and they're like you can either

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:04,190
pay for it as proprietary code or you

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,929
can take it under this copyleft code and

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,380
then they try to sue them for compliance

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:11,450
later because compliance is hard and we

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,040
call it a nuisance enforcement it

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,530
doesn't help the community it doesn't

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,360
make people want to use open-source

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:22,309
licenses it doesn't make people want to

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,690
use it with source code so I think I

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:26,480
have more to say about them being

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:30,410
vultures here but I'll be nice and the

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,690
nuisance enforcement don't do it the

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,000
reason that we want to have compliance

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,030
is that more access to the source helps

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,490
everyone the more people who can access

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,679
it the more solutions we see the more

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,130
localizations the more translations the

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:48,200
more optimizations of the code in

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,090
different instances different

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,580
circumstances we see and that's great

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,280
that's like the point many eye shadow

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,380
bugs we also the more times that code

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,059
gets tried in different places the more

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,809
people who have access to it and can

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:05,179
look at it the more likely they are to

00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,799
solve some of the bugs by you know

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,120
pushing the parameters in different

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,550
places and deploying it in different

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:17,260
places hey Deb there's a question

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:20,180
opencore oh yeah okay so open core is

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,450
open core is when you have one piece of

00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,330
the code is open and then the rest is

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,700
under proprietary license so that's

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,010
there's a couple different sort of rifts

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,080
on that but basically it's sort of hey

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,060
come on in the first ones free and then

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,270
then they try and sell you like the

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:44,750
attachments and the accoutrements does

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:47,810
that answer the question oh yes okay

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,950
great all right so so the other thing

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,630
that's great about having the source

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,710
code available for everyone is that

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:56,480
house innovators compete so if if you've

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,390
got a huge you know like you know open

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,340
court thing like the platform is open

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,380
but all of the other pieces like the

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,690
current state of the art is like five

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,730
years down the road and the rest of that

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,950
source is not available it's really hard

00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,650
to come in as a new innovator in that

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,300
space and so more source means that

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,010
everybody can kind of start at

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,530
everything that's already been written

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,050
as opposed to like cool I have to

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,990
pretend that it's ten years ago and

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:28,510
build my product from there so source

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:32,120
also helps the competitive landscape so

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,560
when we do enforcement we encourage and

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,450
we encourage other folks to do

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,590
enforcement we encourage them to do it

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,000
under what we call the community

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,440
enforcement principles and this I'm just

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,810
going to go through what those are the

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,760
first one is that contact should start

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,170
privately so you shouldn't you know I

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,820
mean this is good for any kind of

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,710
call-out you should start with a call in

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,620
like hey it looks like you aren't

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,600
complying with the license you know and

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,220
it's like kind of instead of like having

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,620
it out there for everyone give people

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,810
the opportunity to be like oh I didn't

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,310
really understand like can you tell me

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,850
more about complete and corresponding

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,920
source and how to come into compliance

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,910
we also assume good intentions not that

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,260
people were you know certainly you know

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,740
I have makes this may be a little bit

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,630
polygons or whatever but you usually

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,920
don't make a lot of progress with

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,990
someone if you come over and you say

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,840
like hey I noticed you're doing it wrong

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,340
but more like here you notice that you

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,760
see when you're struggling with us can

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,440
we help you come into compliance and the

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
goal is to get the source code well

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,410
that's really what we want is the source

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,380
code for all the reasons that I

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:42,230
mentioned it helps it helps you solve

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,990
more bugs it helps the platform become

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:48,770
more ubiquitous it helps you bring in

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,140
more innovation so the source is way

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:54,590
better than any of the other you know

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,960
the nuisance or the irritation or the

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,480
side effect of like many conversations

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,320
with lawyers the source is always the

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,400
main goal in community enforcement and

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,410
it doesn't prioritize financial gain so

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,840
again link when with what we want is the

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,820
source because we want a robust free

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,210
software Commons of source code that

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,220
everybody can access having someone pay

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,990
like a speeding ticket doesn't really

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,390
help us with that goal and you we at the

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,370
Conservancy and other folks that adhere

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,760
to community enforcement principles

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,500
consider legal action as a last resort I

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,560
did mention that lawyers are expensive

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,390
two sets of dueling lawyers or even more

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,410
expensive so legal action is always

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:44,150
considered to be a last resort so you

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,010
may be thinking like wow that's a lot of

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,560
stuff like when should we start thinking

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,380
about compliance on our code bases and

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,740
our work that we put out and the answer

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:59,510
is the earlier the better like super

00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:01,160
early like way like so so early you want

00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,930
to because you want to be able to keep

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,570
track of your dependencies and that

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,090
means every time you're bringing stuff

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:10,490
in especially when you're like kind of

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,920
getting up you're you know you're beta

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,930
version you're bringing in a lot of like

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,050
little functionalities and libraries and

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:20,390
things and you know pieces of like a

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,250
mean platform that your code base rests

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,280
on and you have different versions of

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,530
those and maybe you change them on the

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,380
way in maybe you didn't the earlier you

00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,030
start thinking about compliance and

00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,800
understanding which version of which

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,570
dependencies you've brought in and

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,860
tracking it the better off you're gonna

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,730
do we have a

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:42,890
and yeah yeah sure what mechanisms are

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,299
there to force or encourage code owners

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:49,429
to adhere to these principles so

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:52,790
mechanisms I mean we have the entire

00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,559
legal system but we hope that there's

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,000
you know it's kind of this speaks softly

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,030
and carry a big stick

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,070
that you would say like hey uh obviously

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,470
we would not like to go to court we

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,500
could we have legal standing to do that

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,600
but we would prefer not to so we would

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,419
hope that those conversations earnest

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,240
when you you know initiate with someone

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:16,370
and say hey it seems like you're having

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,900
trouble coming into compliance and

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,510
providing complete and corresponding

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,980
source for this derivative work that

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,309
you're putting out under a copyleft

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:28,429
license how can we help so we try to a

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:30,650
little more carrot but mechanistically

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:33,890
is like you know at the end of the day

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:37,370
like you can sue people for a copyright

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:39,500
infringement for not adhering to the

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,540
additional rights and responsibilities

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,130
that you've added to default copyright

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:50,750
law does that answer that question yes

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:56,120
it does okay thank you thank you Jason

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:57,980
for being my question helper okay so

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,679
dependencies from your hardware vendors

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,460
so even something like this tiny might

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,520
now have code inside of it and if you're

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,100
shipping a product that is largely all

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,530
your stuff in the user land but it has

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,520
this device in it and this device also

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:18,530
has code then and you are providing you

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,929
know you're providing this all is one

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,809
big like derivative work you need to

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:26,210
know what's in that little device so and

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:30,380
that's one of the kind of major

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:33,919
challenges for both for copyleft in the

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,870
compliance kind of supply chain as we

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,660
are building tinier things and putting

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,730
code inside them but you have to do it

00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,169
and the sooner you do start doing it and

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,990
getting used asking your hardware

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:47,150
vendors for the source code for the you

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,040
know the little eye sees and stuff that

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,740
are part of your device the easier it's

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,170
gonna be

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,830
so when you are making a plan for

00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:58,990
compliance and and you know making sure

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,510
you're doing things correctly you want

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,429
to have a lot of folks at the table the

00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,410
open source programs office at a larger

00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:08,679
company can be the convener of this

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,090
conversation but basically you want

00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,440
folks from business you want folks or

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,760
engineering you want folks from

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,140
marketing and you want folks from

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,390
community

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,490
this might seem sort of familiar because

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,929
it's the same folks that you want in the

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,510
room when you think about your overall

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:26,590
open-source strategy you can't have

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,990
business selling something you know in

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,720
one way that doesn't match your

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:35,710
community engagement strategy you can't

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:38,860
have engineering doing stuff and you

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,929
know and engaging like the community in

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,640
a way that you know your marketing folks

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,110
are in ávila

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,150
unaware of you need to have this all

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,559
matched up together and of course the

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,850
legal department if your legal

00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,450
department doesn't know that you're

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,970
shipping open source code then they

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,830
can't really be very effective and you

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,780
don't really want that because again

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:02,170
they're expensive so you should work

00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,630
hard to make them effective should also

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,400
be talking to your upstream so if you if

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,700
you're building something on top of like

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,390
a large platform like you know so say

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:17,170
you provide something that is like an

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:20,740
add-on like a web piece or web component

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,870
to a large database you should be

00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,179
talking with your upstream all the time

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,100
so that you know what they're doing as

00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:29,140
far as compliance you understand what

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,870
their conversations about licensing are

00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,630
and you understand what their plans

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:37,620
about licensing are and that way you can

00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:40,120
work together with them on compliance

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,580
stronger communities plus better and

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,270
more secure code like what's not to love

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,820
right so everyone has their own

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:52,140
strengths and there are pieces to the

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,429
table kind of like the Scooby Gang here

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,679
you want to make sure that your

00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,179
compliance stuff you have understanding

00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,950
on the engineering side of what

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:01,590
constitutes compliance you have a good

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,559
understanding on

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:08,549
you know even your folks sit by your

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,320
point person what's happening and that

00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:12,270
like you're marketing and sales and

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,250
business folks also understand what the

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,340
plan is so that it works for their

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:20,159
overall engagement strategy Oh

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,510
so the next thing I'm going to do I'm

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,150
going to provide a couple of different

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,880
links for resources and then I will take

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,549
some more questions but I'll just go

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,809
through these first pretty quickly and

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,200
I'll put the slides up later

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:37,890
so copy lipid or is a really great place

00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:44,450
to go and find resources on how copyleft

00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:44,450
licenses work reign the name I'm great

00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:55,960
this is receipt if you wanted

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:58,119
the GPL you can put a GPS I don't want

00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,070
you you don't have a question about your

00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:01,779
connection is getting a little bad so I

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,629
just I didn't I just didn't want anyone

00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:05,859
to have a bad experience with that so

00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:09,609
okay I don't I don't know if you can

00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:11,139
check on your connection but maybe maybe

00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,909
drop your did you drop your video

00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,850
already

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:20,169
no okay

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:25,539
well maybe just get back okay looks here

00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:28,269
we okay it says yeah I I'm talking to

00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:31,509
y'all from Cambridge which is one of the

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:35,649
cities that has a monopoly service

00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:37,239
provider for internet so we can complain

00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:40,239
and they can point to the 20 year

00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:42,070
contract the city made well you're about

00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:44,529
to do something much better no thanks

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:47,230
okay oh they got me there they're like

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:50,529
she's gonna do sus like alright poor on

00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,960
the internet I just slide over so some

00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,299
people can didn't miss anything so we

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,119
have copyleft org that one specifically

00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:00,659
about copy life stuff we've got open

00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,159
source add org which is a list of a

00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,320
recognized open source licenses that are

00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,549
you know major ones and use if you wrote

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,559
one tomorrow they're not gonna start

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,590
going to show up on there tomorrow

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:16,419
GPL FAQ which is particularly about the

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:18,489
GPL license the Apache site has specific

00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:22,149
license information about the apache

00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:24,369
license and fsf.org they have a family

00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:29,409
of licenses in addition to the GPL the

00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:34,840
LGPL the a GPL and both versions of the

00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:36,609
GPL version 2 and version 3 so I didn't

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,559
know Jason was going to intro this talk

00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:40,389
when I had this little plug here but you

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,789
can find some current writings and

00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:45,220
thoughts on the legal side of

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:48,549
open-source in open source comm if you

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,129
go to slash tagged slash law and there's

00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:53,679
a usually a pretty good roundup each

00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:57,629
year like 10 most important things that

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,629
happen in the legal Spectre

00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:06,750
a GPL enforcement I mentioned before on

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:13,500
FF Conservancy org that's our website

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:17,040
and ideas on how to be more engaged and

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,440
get a baked complying it's a little bit

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,350
easier and get a little bit more or

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,169
soaked in on the current conversations

00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,140
are about licenses and compliance so

00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:30,929
bring your lawyer to a fly event

00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:33,300
sign up for news from Conservancy from

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,980
the open source initiative apache debian

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,860
and any other technical communities you

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,399
work with check out talks from folks who

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:45,390
run programs offices make some fast

00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:50,000
friends here online well not IRL yet but

00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:50,000
maybe next year and when you read

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,010
kepta sysm there is a slight

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,220
be really hard and there is you know

00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:12,040
like thousands and thousands of people

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,870
waiting out there to see you it's not

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,250
true if someone tells you that there are

00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,680
thousands and thousands of people

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:21,490
waiting out there to see you other you

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,280
should expect this this is the park and

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:28,360
tell you how they can help for money so

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:33,370
just you know three of that one um these

00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,500
are my you know credits for the pictures

00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,370
and stuff and then I would be happy to

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,290
take questions

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:42,580
oh that's like that yeah you're right

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,620
when you were trying to get credit the

00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,590
slides went out so it looks like the

00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:51,990
platform automatically like the texture

00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:54,970
it's like you're done yeah okay

00:35:51,990 --> 00:36:01,330
questions yeah perfect

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:05,500
okay thanks for going through the yeah

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:09,940
the bad Internet's and the the funny fun

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,560
fun with new tools but I would be happy

00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:17,440
to take questions and I'm looking at the

00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:22,450
chat now so thing I need me anymore

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,870
thanks I mean I I need you and uh you

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:29,890
know in an emotional sense but not in a

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:32,740
functional sense I guess thank you by

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,450
the way for doing the questions as we

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,960
went no problem

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,240
happy to help thank you alright

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,740
Jason says Jason Baker says what advice

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,210
would you have for someone who does not

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,280
have standing and comes across a

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:51,040
potential compliance violation like for

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:54,130
example a user so I would so it depends

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,900
you might have standing to ask for the

00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,720
source code so if it's a device like a

00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,730
you know like a TiVo or busybox or a

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,490
router or something that says like you

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,980
know this contains GPL code you can

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,190
write and ask because you have been

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,200
given a code that is under a copyleft

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,900
license which means that you have a

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,900
right to the source code so you can ask

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:20,050
for that it would be hard for you

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:24,040
probably to have standing for a lawsuit

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:26,230
around that but maybe one day I would

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,350
also see if you could figure out what

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:34,810
source code it is that you want that you

00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,270
want access to and who is the holder the

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,420
copyright holder and you may be able to

00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,640
join forces with copyright holder and

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:47,320
say here was my experience in here's how

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,390
I can add to you know your you know your

00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,700
understanding of the state of compliance

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,850
on the code that you produced in the

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,630
device that you notice the violation in

00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,630
design you answer your question Jason

00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,390
yay

00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,390
any other questions

00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:24,440
oh I'm just got in the backlog to see if

00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,350
we miss anything

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:34,040
ELISA we do not I know compliance is a

00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:37,610
big dense topic but yeah it is

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:40,100
I I hope you at least don't have to go

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,960
and have a lawyer explain to you how

00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,050
copyright law works now

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:51,230
so that's because I'll definitely take

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:53,000
your money from that okay bye I I was

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,660
going to talk earlier with Jim Salter

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,240
and he mentioned like having a license

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,590
for your open source project so I don't

00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,900
know if that's a topic you want to talk

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,250
about for a moment and like how

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,600
important it is to have to start with

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,850
the license and those types of things

00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,290
and then there's another clear you can

00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:13,970
on the chat yeah okay so I would say as

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,640
much as possible if you can pick a

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:20,600
copyleft license you should because it

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:24,470
adds to the overall free software

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:27,320
Commons the nice question in the chat is

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:31,000
actually like when is the a GPL the most

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:38,540
useful and I would say that when you are

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,920
creating a platform like a GPL is you

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,410
need to be creating kind of your own

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,750
platform so I helped with a project

00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,700
called media goblin and we use the a GPL

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,850
for that but as soon as we built like a

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,560
platform for hosting various media that

00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,750
is organized around the individual as

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,610
opposed to being organized around the

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,340
media types so instead of having like

00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,750
your manifesto over here and your video

00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,380
here and your pictures here and your

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,730
songs over here you have the you cite

00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,570
those built for sharing so it's its own

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:10,640
platform and that's what you want if

00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:13,820
you're just building like a module for

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,210
Drupal or or any you know or WordPress

00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,200
or Joomla or any number of other things

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,410
you don't want to put that under the a

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,140
GPL because they can't bring it back

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:26,350
into the main code base because they

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,480
have this entire ecosystem of code that

00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,760
is not ready to be switched to the a GPL

00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,460
so they just won't take your code

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,960
so if you're building something new from

00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,550
scratch a platform that you think other

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,870
people might want to build on that's a

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:44,540
great place to use the HG PL not for

00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:48,140
nuisance enforcement and and I'm not

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:50,450
that the whole Conservancy is of one

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,400
mind on that that the nuisance

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,410
enforcement we were like oh you can have

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,480
it for free under the a GPL but then I'm

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:00,440
gonna try really hard to see you in a

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,210
month is like we're very much frowned on

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,210
did I answer your question Jamie

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:21,530
I'll go ahead and assume yes okay great

00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:26,090
yes yeah yeah the ATPL didn't end up

00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:29,780
having the kind of I'm not sure what the

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,300
adoption strategy was for the AGPL I

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,740
think one of the reasons that the GPL

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:39,980
worked so well is that a lot of core

00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:43,730
tools like the Linux kernel and you know

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:46,880
get software was put under that and was

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,650
their first and so things that got built

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,730
on top of it were already built on top

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:55,360
of like GPL code so so think of ways to

00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:57,890
like maybe kind of mirror that

00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,380
experience as opposed to like you can't

00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,840
just give somebody one little optional

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:09,940
module that's that's not going to drive

00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:12,410
adoption of of a new license all right

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,180
so I think we're out of time

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,470
I'll hang up really maybe two or three

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,110
more minutes if people want to type

00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:22,070
anything or if you wanna I don't know if

00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:25,160
we have a direct message on here but

00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:27,380
otherwise thanks so much for coming you

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,120
can also write to me dev at SF

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,620
Conservancy dot org if you have a

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,750
question that you didn't want to ask in

00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,340
channel for the group again I'm not a

00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,740
lawyer you're not gonna get secret free

00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,780
legal advice but if you had a question

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,160
that you thought of just a little bit

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,980
later or you just didn't want to ask in

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,220
public you can shoot me a note that way

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,790
okay

00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,790
