[Music]

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,830
all righty Thank You Todd I hope

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,220
everyone's doing well

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,800
welcome to the the orbiting bacon Space

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,560
Station I hope you're all safe and well

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,170
wherever you may be so I'm thrilled to

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,970
be here I absolutely love the work that

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,279
Todd and the team do I love all things

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,990
open it's a real bummer that we're we're

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,420
not going to be there in person in in

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,710
Austin today but it's so awesome the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,809
fact the fact that we're all here to get

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,540
together virtually is the truest essence

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,379
of community so I'm gonna talk today for

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,730
about 15 minutes

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,640
and you don't have to know a lot about

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,620
open source to get a lot out of this but

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,570
every one of you is gonna influence a

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,910
community in some way you may join a

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,289
community you may start a community it

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,879
doesn't really matter and I think this

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,530
will this will be very very relevant to

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,840
you so it was a little bit of backstory

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,850
I was raised in a place in northern

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,440
England it was very boring and it was

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,329
very picturesque okay it looks a little

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,070
bit like this and when I was growing up

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,229
I heard the same thing over and over

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,700
again people don't really know their

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,860
neighbors like they did back in the good

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,780
old days my parents my grandparents

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,939
everybody waffled on and on about how

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,040
the sense of community was was kind of

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,750
dying and leaving and this wasn't my

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,460
experience you know when I was like 18

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,560
or 19 years old they looked like this

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,090
this is a picture a friend of mine

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
Stewart and I dug up while at the pub

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,590
just before the coronavirus and I

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,030
started a website called Linux UK and

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,159
which looked a little bit like this and

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,259
this was designed to kind of get people

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,840
in the UK together this was back in 1998

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,740
and was just excited about meeting other

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,299
open-source people went to university

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,040
started a Linux user group called

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,140
Wolverhampton Linux user group and then

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,990
met some people there and got interested

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,850
in the project called KDE so organized a

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,189
booth down at a conference in London you

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,649
can see the you know printed out bits of

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,170
paper and iron-on decals and t-shirts

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,090
and things like that and then down that

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,070
that conference ended up bumping into a

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,659
couple of guys in the pub who started a

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,040
magazine called Linux format magazine

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,329
and I said to them do you mind if I

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,489
write an article for you and they said

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,840
sure but if it's terrible we weren't

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,370
publish it which seemed like reasonable

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,400
terms so anyway I started you know

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,110
talking about started talking about a

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,940
place that just opened up near where I

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,040
live called open advantage which

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,510
provided free training consulting people

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,950
who were up skilling into open source

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,080
who used to work in factories and

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,340
manufacturing and that led me out to go

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,319
and fly around the world and meet people

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,980
at conferences I got interested in the

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,379
genome project and kicked off a project

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,760
called jerk oh sure and then that led to

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,409
building a community around that

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,510
particular project the whole reason why

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm going through this condensed

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,310
biography is because when I kept hearing

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,420
this people don't know their neighbors

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,819
like they did back in the good old days

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,459
I wasn't seeing it I was seeing this

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,560
amazing group of people all over the

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,450
world who come together and this is

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,760
what's so exciting about this to me is

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,280
that community is out there and it's

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,470
thriving this right that what is

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,299
happening right now is a good example of

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,310
this and what this is is this

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,040
international network of minds who come

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,079
together to share experience and talent

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,569
and expertise and open source I think is

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,340
a wonderful example of this so you know

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,319
it's not just my experience we've seen

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,599
the growth of Wikipedia we've seen open

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,160
source dominating every possible

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,739
industry from the cloud to

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,930
infrastructure to devices we've seen the

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,549
maker revolution happen you know many of

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,049
you will have kids who are making things

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,450
who are creating interesting little

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,709
inventions which is unlocking their

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,209
creativity we've seen the

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,639
democratization of funding with

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,650
crowdfunding and it's not just these

00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,329
areas we've seen Salesforce and sa

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,760
people communities of over a million

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,910
members harley-davidson over 1,700 local

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,090
user groups leggo allow their community

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,099
members to make LEGO sets iGEM bring

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,319
gamers together hit record allows people

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,819
to work together on productions that

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,489
many of which have shown being shown at

00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:01,549
Sundance so there's so much community

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:04,220
excitement going on out there and to me

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,500
it gets back to this network of Mines is

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,030
that with stronger together is that when

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,099
we unlock that potential we can really

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,750
get out there and do almost anything but

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,090
to me what's really exciting about this

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,889
is open-source this is what got me into

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,780
it and this to me is one of the finest

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,639
examples of what makes community so

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,010
powerful and one of the reasons why

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,990
open-source works so well is that we're

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,849
able to get together and share the same

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,110
material you know like there could be

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,120
somebody I'm hearing

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,659
California on the orbiting space station

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,000
and there may be someone out there in in

00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,409
Warsaw who and we could both quake at

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,389
work in exactly the same project we can

00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,069
have the same content the code the

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,860
documentation we can coordinate online

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,870
events now we have the ability to work

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,189
together effectively so in this session

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,080
I want to walk through some things that

00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,580
I've learned over the course of my

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,719
career that I think are relevant to any

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,949
of you who are getting interested in

00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:54,229
communities it doesn't matter whether

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:57,050
you want to set up a local group about

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,460
open source in your town or whether you

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,020
want to start an open-source project or

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,090
join an open-source project it doesn't

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,219
require having a ton of experience these

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,560
are three things I think it's important

00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:08,270
for you to bear in mind the first one is

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,150
that the best experiences of journeys

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,250
okay if any of you've been at Disney

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,750
World when you show up and you you park

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,310
your car and you buy your tickets and

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,379
that you go in through the gate and then

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,090
they guide you around the park and how

00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:21,379
the restaurants open and serve the right

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,409
amount of traffic everything is

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:26,240
carefully curated if you look at great

00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,560
restaurants from how you show up and

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,939
they pour you water and they bring you

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,710
the menus and then you order from the

00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:32,060
menu and they bring you it at the right

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,069
cadence everything is carefully

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,849
orchestrated video games are another

00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,889
example

00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,479
I just bought Luigi's Mansion three for

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,849
my son recently we were both playing it

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,729
the first couple of levels are very very

00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,259
carefully designed for you to pick up

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,629
the controls and feel a sense of

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,250
accomplishment here's the thing your

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:50,930
community needs to be more than this it

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,310
needs to be more than just a github repo

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,740
it needs to be more than just a meetup

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,409
page it needs to be more than just the

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,779
basics of you being on the internet it

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,400
needs to be the whole experience in how

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,879
we build that journey out now you may be

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,889
thinking okay jonno how on earth do we

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,180
do that well this is how I would

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,009
recommend it this is one of the things

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,719
Todd mentioned I got this book people

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,949
power this is how I would recommend you

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,750
approach it and I covered this in the

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,939
book the first thing we do is we

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,680
understand who our audience is you know

00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:21,310
do we want to attract developers event

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,439
organizers do you want people to use our

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,759
software or come to our events and then

00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,409
we design an onboarding experience

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,000
that's really simple for them to do

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,740
something that's valuable for them so if

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,050
they want to join your community and ask

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,729
a question and get an answer that's an

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,289
onboarding experience if they want to

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,580
contribute their first bit of code to an

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,529
open-source project that's their

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,999
onboarding experience the point is is

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,069
that we simplify this because you can

00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:45,769
go into as much promotion as you want in

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,209
the whole world and if they all come

00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,309
through the front door and no one knows

00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,259
how to get started then there's kind of

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,610
screwed okay so think about what are the

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,929
five or six steps they need to go

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,369
through from learning about your

00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,739
community to how they do something

00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:00,019
that's valuable for them now what we do

00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,529
is we break them into three phases of a

00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,079
journey

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:05,119
I call them casual regulars and core so

00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,919
when you're casual you kind of knew you

00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,289
don't really know what's going on just

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,459
think about when you first joined

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:11,089
open-source 101 today you didn't really

00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:13,249
know anyone

00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:15,379
this has hold new platforms a little bit

00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,360
weird and kind of a you're unusual it's

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:18,739
cool but it's different right there's a

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,719
lot of insecurity a lot of people

00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,249
experience impostor syndrome especially

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,599
people are in underrepresented groups

00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,759
can especially find this a really

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,049
difficult phase to kind of get into so

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,819
we need to make this really simple for

00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:29,929
them to get started in when people are

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,159
regulars this is where they've been

00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,749
around for a couple of months and

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,069
they're hanging out and they've kind of

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:35,539
got to know people and then the core

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,579
members of the people who were just

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,679
super engaged they're like the people

00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,769
who are just incredibly passionate about

00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:44,449
your community so in the casual phase

00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,059
you really want to focus on the access

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,349
and the relationships help people to you

00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,239
know have pretty simple and effective

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,579
problem-solving be able to build

00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:54,469
relationships effectively provide plenty

00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,209
of training webinars and programs

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:58,129
instructional blog posts and other

00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,439
different bits and pieces maybe some

00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,689
formal mentoring this is really powerful

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,479
to help simplify how people settle into

00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,649
the pool that is your community now for

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,059
the regulars this is all about

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,039
collaboration you've got these people

00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:12,289
who are pretty excited about how all of

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,909
this stuff works and what you want to

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,039
make sure is that you can unlock their

00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:18,289
creativity you know encourage people to

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,379
maybe set up new projects and new events

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,089
matchmake people to work on new areas of

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,559
your community you know for example

00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,329
let's say you're running a local group

00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,919
in your town and there's some there's

00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,119
some community members who live in

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,709
another town it's nearby it may be

00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:33,110
encourage them to organize another group

00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:35,779
there have competitions and hackathons

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,069
it's about enable them enabling them to

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,259
have the confidence to go and do these

00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:41,149
interesting things and then for the core

00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,029
people this is about tapping into their

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:45,829
wisdom here's a tip right no matter what

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,230
you're doing with your building products

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,120
or software or building communities the

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,920
answers to all of your questions live in

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,809
the heads of your audience okay and we

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,850
want to tap into that and our core

00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,829
members have got so

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,449
much expertise they can share so share

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:00,220
regular one-on-one sessions with them

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:01,480
involve them in the design and the

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,670
planning of your future community

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,259
projects bring them into a channel where

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,560
they can discuss these things it's all

00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:10,959
about unlocking that creativity so this

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,980
is the journey that I recommend and one

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,540
of the things we do to keep people

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
moving forward is we apply a series of

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,050
incentives which I'm going to get to a

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,310
little bit later on but what I do want

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,319
to focus on before I get to that is the

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,240
second area and this is that we designed

00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,259
for people right it's easy especially in

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,449
open source for us to talk about

00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:27,579
technology and computers and machines

00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:28,959
and all this kind of stuff but at the

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,579
end of the day there's a human

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,800
psychology that we need to understand

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,779
and the way it looks a little bit like

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,149
this is that when you join any community

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,410
or any group and this happened today

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,730
first of all you have access to it you

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,920
need to get access to go and participate

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,420
then when you start contributing and

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,639
doing some interesting things you kind

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,319
of get a sense of how it works it starts

00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,880
building some self-respect that you you

00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,110
can figure this stuff out that you can

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,569
understand this new world that you're

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,130
entering into when this happens over and

00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,569
over again you keep contributing to keep

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,610
building that self-respect it builds a

00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,470
sense of dignity and this means that you

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,180
really feel like you've got some worth

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,800
in this community that you're a part of

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,300
and then that gives you the confidence

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,550
to have an impact that means you can

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,920
think bigger and you think of new and

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,600
interesting ideas and propose things

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,730
that haven't been done before without

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,889
worrying about you know people kind of

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,000
knocking you down when this happens over

00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,380
and over again it builds a sense of

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,509
belonging and this is the ultimate

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,819
treasure in any community any workplace

00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,949
any family is it you feel part of

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,939
something and that if you were to go

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:27,790
where you'd be missed

00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,839
okay the the key thing here is access

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,790
and belonging

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,050
we start with access make sure people

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,850
have got equal access to join your

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,649
community and focus on all the different

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,509
pieces that need to go through to get to

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,040
that point of belonging always be

00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,689
focused on this human psychological

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,300
element cuz if you forget this you're

00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:45,130
just basically tweaking software okay

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,540
the tricky thing here is that there are

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,160
millions of things out there that can

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,259
distract us away from people coming to

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,269
your communities this is an actual photo

00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,560
taken inside of a human brain this is

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,589
how much junk we've got enough brains

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,269
right the Tiger King good example so

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,209
what makes people want to try something

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,250
new it's a it's very simple is that it

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,269
provides clear value is it does

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,189
something really relevant and

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,260
interesting to them so for example

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:08,769
Firefox right that make it very clear

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,720
why

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,910
use their browser these are the benefits

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,290
of using it the cloud native computing

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,999
foundation makes it very clear about

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,129
what they do to bring value to the

00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:20,860
infrastructure space okay so that's one

00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,209
things really important to focus on what

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,499
is the value that someone's going to get

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,239
out of your community whether it's your

00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:27,699
group your open source project or

00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:28,629
something else and then the third thing

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:31,329
that I want to touch on here is

00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,369
incentives we are as human beings really

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,589
incentivize Abul and we're all guilty of

00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,600
this right we collect airline while we

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,299
used to collect ila airline master miles

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,100
until there was no aeroplanes anymore we

00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,839
get reddit Karma we collect these little

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,489
stamps on coffee cards when you get your

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,679
tenth stamp you get a free coffee we

00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:49,480
collect video game trophies and badges

00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,509
and Fitbit in places like that and

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,129
what's awesome about this is that if we

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,600
if we see something that's interesting

00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,459
we're willing to work for it and the

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,049
reason for that is that psychologically

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,459
we're hunter-gatherers right is that

00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,899
we're always wanting to make sure we can

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,519
protect ourselves and have enough

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,470
sustenance and food and all that kind of

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,850
stuff and this is just wired into our

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,139
brains because our brains have really

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,119
haven't had an upgrade in a long time

00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,069
now there's two ways in which you can

00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:13,360
approach that these incentives one is

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:15,730
called stated and one is called

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,589
submarine so for the stated incentives

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,689
what you do is you say if you do this

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,329
thing you will get this thing okay so

00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:24,249
for example github as a game off and

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,670
this is where if you come participate in

00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:29,649
the competition you will get the prizes

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,939
in in the competition hacker one has got

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,709
a leaderboard where if you go and

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:34,480
participate in it you may get particular

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,790
rewards based upon their the reputation

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,549
that you've generated many of you may be

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,720
familiar with Stack Overflow if you do a

00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,639
certain thing you get one of these

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,160
badges such as if your question is

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,819
favorited by 25 people you get the

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,009
favorite question badge so I think

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,660
wiring into your community lots of these

00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,119
specific things okay give very clear

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,799
incentives that if you do this great but

00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,629
if you do this great work or if you

00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,639
demonstrate the behavior that we want to

00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,949
see you will be rewarded in some way and

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,540
this doesn't have to be swag it can be

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,999
just a thank you it can be public

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,399
recognition it's more about the the

00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:12,759
incentive and the reward and the

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,649
recognition the other type of the other

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,790
type of incentive here is what I call a

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,049
submarine and these are kind of the

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,970
sneaky cousin these are the most fun

00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,410
wants to put together and essentially

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,590
what you do is you use computers to

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,320
design sorry to

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:27,240
to detect when someone's done something

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,090
that you want to happen and then you

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,800
reward them in a very human way so to

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,440
give you an example one of things I

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,270
often do with my clients is when they

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,490
reach a particular trust level in the

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,410
platform called discourse we recognize

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,510
them public we say thank you for their

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,390
amazing contributions we highlight them

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,910
we often send them a swag kit and it's

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,050
because they've they've contributed

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,300
consistently to a particular point that

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,340
we've measured another example of this

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,450
is our friends are open source calm you

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,860
know when people have contributed a

00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,210
certain amount of content to their

00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,430
website they will send people swag

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,870
matter most will send people mugs with

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,370
their name written on it when they

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,470
submit their first contribution and

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,900
another example of this at open source

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,430
com is when people have contributed a

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,190
lot they'll actually fly people out to

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,620
Raleigh where they'll join a day of

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,910
meetings to work on open source or

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,740
common what it means and how it can be

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,150
grown but they'll also get to go to all

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,500
things open and they'll get to meet

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,940
people like Jim Whitehurst who was the

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,600
CEO of Red Hat and is now the president

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,490
of IBM this network of humor of minds is

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,170
amazing okay and we're only just

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,880
beginning to tap into the potential here

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,080
so I'd encourage you to go and think

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,300
about these things and what it means for

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,280
your community and then just a very

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,480
briefly wrap up as I mentioned earlier

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,030
on I've got a new book out it's called

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,290
people-powered thrilled it just won an

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,580
award recently at the business book

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,400
awards and it's got pretty decent

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,170
reviews on Amazon and Goodreads and it's

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,820
a bestseller so go and check out the

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,850
book and what might be relevant to you

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,100
is I've set up a page for this event if

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,990
you go to Jonah bacon com4 slash pack

thank you all for joining especially

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,009
given the time that we're in it is

00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:36,809
really exciting and thank you mr. bacon

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:38,399
for your speech hello there I'm a big

00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:41,699
fan of yours I know we spoke back say

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,920
just once say hi again but yes it's

00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,139
hello everybody I am dr. Shannon Brown I

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,439
am chief technology officer at a company

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,100
called North Studio and yeah a big part

00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:54,899
of my session is going to be focused on

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,749
what is it that defines a great

00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,420
open-source engineer and I do a lot of

00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:02,850
thinking about this topic and kind of

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,069
reflecting on not just my career itself

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,259
but the progression of the history of

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:10,410
open-source when I was preparing for

00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:13,019
this talk and back when I you know for

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,850
many of us back when I first was back in

00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,199
undergrad and that was you know as my

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,100
niece would say back when dinosaurs

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,069
roamed the earth

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,389
about 18 or 20 years ago you know

00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:23,309
they're really the concept of

00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,019
open-source was not really anything it

00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,389
didn't really exist at least not in the

00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,889
sense that we knew it when they were

00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,839
training us for school or when we were

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:33,240
you know training an undergrad and the

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,009
heaviest focus was you know learning the

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,589
basics of coding of course that was

00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:39,720
always the foundation for the house and

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,910
and refining your skills learning about

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,910
compilers and binary code and all of

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,769
these things that really teach you to

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,249
address the hallmarks of what

00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:53,670
engineering is but not necessarily craft

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:55,199
mastery beyond the coding skills and

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,420
then when you got to the more senior

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,079
level of your academic program usually

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,329
the options were to focus on Java or C++

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,419
coding there really weren't many

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:11,699
frameworks at that time penny it was the

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:13,770
focus was IDE s frameworks and and that

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,909
was the thing and then you know there

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:22,140
was a huge push to mostly progress then

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:26,549
over to basically the idea of getting a

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:29,159
certification in one or more major you

00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:31,320
know platforms as far as IB a Microsoft

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:33,600
all of the big boys that were around at

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,100
the time and that was going to be the

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,590
key to a prosperous

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,440
career well over time as PHP became a

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,100
much bigger mainstay in the market you

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,169
saw a big kickback on proprietary

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,390
systems particularly those that had you

00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,429
know big license tags and so this shift

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,370
really happened as to how we think about

00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,440
computing and now you know this concept

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,320
of making a career in open-source has

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,700
really evolved and so first I thought

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,039
about what the definition of great is

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,590
and and I think that that is something

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,030
to definitely talk about and that I'll

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,030
go over in more detail in my fuller

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,880
session but to me it's it's not just one

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:15,090
stack or one platform right it anymore

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,530
it is just having a wide variety of

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,750
industry knowledge to the point that you

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,880
have mastered your craft now there's a

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,429
again a really there's a number of

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,260
flavors of ways to think about that if

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,120
you want to specialize that's one way to

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,799
do it if you want to be sort of a

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,429
jack-of-all-trades that's also a way to

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,809
do it

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:35,460
freelancing has also become way more

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:39,720
common in our industry as many of you

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:42,830
know I think what mr. bacon also touched

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,630
on as well that is a key theme of my

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,570
presentation is that you know outside of

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,730
the main foundation of the house which

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,280
is coding which will always be important

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,049
you know I I compare it to you know chef

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,360
Gordon Ramsay which is that you know

00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:00,510
he's a big everybody knows his name the

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,179
big five-star you know chef and multiple

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,159
Michelin stars and you know we see him

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,510
on reality TV and big presents and all

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,480
the yelling but the

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:13,630
behind all of that marketing and all of

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,929
that presence in persona you know was a

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,639
really bright dedicated chef who was

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,460
very very good at what he did who worked

00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:23,380
really long night and you know mastered

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,480
his craft and then beyond that that the

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,860
take-off happened and so that will

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,139
always be the foundation of the house

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,409
but to really make the rest of the house

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:34,720
a house it's the communication it is the

00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:38,289
people presence it is the social skills

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,659
and I think that what you'll find is as

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,370
a leader particularly as you work your

00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:44,740
way up in your career even as you start

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,620
in your career as you get out of school

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,820
it's more than just or if you if you're

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,779
not you know school person that's

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,870
totally fine too

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,500
as you progress in your career you know

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,429
you will find that as I have found that

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,799
communication is really the cornerstone

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,409
of a lot of other things and that

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,029
includes your interview skills I think

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,490
that that's another thing that people

00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,860
should think of as it's one skill set in

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,250
the realm of soft skills that is so

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,480
important as far as the concept of what

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,370
is it that you're looking to achieve

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,500
from the organization you are

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,760
interviewing with and what is it that

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,010
they can offer you as an engineer and

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,200
what can you offer them you know is it's

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,720
a meeting of the mind and four

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,110
organizations as well understanding what

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,750
to look for in engineers who are going

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,519
to be with you a long time who are going

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,159
to bring not just skills to the table

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,139
but the collaboration and being able to

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,269
grow and grow with your company and with

00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,100
the model of the design one of the

00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:46,929
things I touch on and you know for a

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,720
little back story about myself so I got

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:53,019
my doctorate about four years ago from

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,210
Capella University I graduated 4.0 GPA

00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:57,399
top of my class I was the first black

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,429
woman and one planet to ever be

00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:03,220
published to have an advanced degree

00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,360
from my school of this type and I was

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,159
the first personal world to ever publish

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,010
a dissertation specifically on Drupal

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,769
and the topic of it was a quantitative

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,570
study on Drupal in academia and the

00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,940
motivations for contributing to open

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,490
source as a whole so understanding this

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,990
concept and and lost very short what I

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,600
learned from going

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,610
that research being a published author

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,290
is that the outcome of that experiment

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,059
and the statistical analysis of

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,100
interviewing nearly 500 people in the

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,170
open-source community is that the only

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,090
real statistical correlation that you

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,490
find as to why people are doing this is

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:40,330
indeed to build a career to build a

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,280
legacy to build something that is needy

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,920
going to feel like a community or

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,440
something for which as mr. Baker touched

00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,700
on for which that if they left or if

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,370
they were no longer part of they would

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,120
be missed and that's the fuller picture

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,340
is still the people aspect of this

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,830
entirety so and in thinking about this

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,179
you know the other thing to consider is

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,120
so how do you stay in this for the long

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:07,720
run because it is a high intensity field

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,880
as many as you know it is can be very

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,290
deadline intensive there's a lot of

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,600
money involved in it so how do you

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,429
self-sustained and talking about the

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,040
burnout factor with the people people

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:21,130
factor right one interesting statistic I

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,860
did some research before getting on for

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,010
ready for this panel and I was really

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,140
shocked to learn that as of 2017 we in

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,360
the technology field have the highest

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,220
turnover rate of any industry more than

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,770
even the restaurant industry or the food

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,470
industry they have arrested a turnover a

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,059
rate of about 13% we have a turnover

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,960
rate of about thirteen point two percent

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:45,070
the big companies like Google and Yahoo

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,340
you guys want to know what the I was

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,750
really strike to hear this but you guys

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,240
know what the turnover right there it

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,190
really is the average tenure for an

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,500
engineer now at Google and Yahoo and the

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,050
other top five companies is just 13

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,450
months that's it 13 months that's how

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,190
that's how short it is and understand

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,620
that there's a lot to that that is by

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,260
design and I think a lot of people don't

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,059
know that and understanding sort of this

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,160
churn and burn culture we've developed

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:15,340
and what's that what that's doing to us

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,770
as an engineers and how to self-sustain

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,140
that I think that the at the end of the

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,610
day you've got to focus on a number of

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,429
things which of course is work-life

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,010
balance that's always a big part of it

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,240
but trying to focus an organization is

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,550
to it's not just the engineers or

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,500
organizations realizing that this is

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,430
contributing to a lot of turnover

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,870
turnovers of course

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,330
very costly particularly when you have

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,740
big long-term projects you know is it

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,360
really isn't it I think it's

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,580
fundamentally better to admit you've

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,230
underbid a project than to lose a tech

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,120
lead for six months and to be left in a

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,310
lurch because then the ripple effect of

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,810
that it can be far worse than a few

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,940
thousand dollars that you you might have

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,540
had to reconcile with a client and so

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,980
thinking about this in a more totalistic

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,990
understanding of our culture as

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,010
engineers and where we are what happened

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,500
how did we get here

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:06,040
again I talked more about that in my

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,100
session but you know in a nutshell it's

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,350
understanding what I think where you

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,180
want to go do you want to be are you a

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,340
more in the weeds person are you a more

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,530
social person on how to find that

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,290
overlap the more you work your way up on

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,510
the totem pole the more communication is

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,440
gonna be a big cornerstone and a vital

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,660
part of what you do

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,970
writing is gonna be a huge part of what

00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,400
you do writing proposals your boss needs

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,230
that RFP writing your boss needs that

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,480
they need people who can speak

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,400
intelligently to clients in a way that's

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,090
engaging without going over their head

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,340
too much and the more you can be a part

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,890
of that fuller business model the more

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,780
doors that are open to you and so

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,370
experiment with what your passion is and

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,100
a lot of that work is outside of just

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,660
your immediate job it's outside of just

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,400
whatever sometimes even what your job

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,280
can provide you it's the social skills

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,710
again as mr. bacon saying with meetups I

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,250
love meetup calm it's a big part for

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:06,520
myself that works primarily for Drupal

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,430
WordPress full-stack angular react type

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,440
of setups it's been immeasurable for us

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,050
in networking with our own community we

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,300
go we have our own conferences there as

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,610
well and those are those are also

00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,430
critical things again dat once again

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,770
developing those social skills getting

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,540
reliable tools reliable tools equals

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,970
reliable work as I say just like a

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,260
carpenter they have tools or hallmarks

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,910
of what they do and they get you know

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,190
very expensive tools as many of you know

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,620
because you've got to do that to do

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,940
reliable work it's the same for us

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,170
invest in quality tools for your

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,590
developers if your of your

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,390
organization's invest in good training I

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,760
am surprised at how many organizations

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,380
don't really provide standardized

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,820
training methods

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,230
for all of their engineers on the

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,870
ongoing basis I also think that's

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,120
contributing to turn and burn invest in

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,560
them there you know for software certain

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,510
software engineering it's the hallmark

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,880
of your end I'm sorry it's the core of

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,580
your engine room so you should invest in

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,160
it wisely listen to your engineers they

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,130
are you listen to their voice make sure

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,900
to guard against the concept of constant

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,640
emergencies remember that our industry

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
is one that will always people are

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,610
always gonna want right now right now

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,200
right everybody wants their stuff on the

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,210
website right now right now drop

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,790
everything all of that but in our world

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,470
to sort of Proctor against what I call

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,230
false emergencies which is the concept

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,120
that we everything is an emergency it

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,740
should really only be two or three real

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,080
definition emergencies in your

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,690
organization for any type of regular

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,330
deployment shop it is when a production

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:40,210
site is launching or a production system

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,710
is down otherwise if there are if you're

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,710
the other exception is if your

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,570
organization has things like some type

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,370
of emergency contractor things like that

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,380
we have to get a response within 24

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,270
hours that to of course is an on-call

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,220
service that you would set up but

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,950
otherwise it's it is just regular course

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,570
of business for most cases and that can

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,300
also really help cut down on engineer

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,250
burnout I also think that Agri that

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,800
hybrid models of agile can cut down on

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,150
what I call sort of conceptual deadlines

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,740
that don't really have a lot of meaning

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,170
you know the whole two weeks printing

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,490
works well to get sort of scheduled and

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,530
developing or understanding where you

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,090
are where you are but as far as like

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,940
this pressure to kind of deliver every

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,700
two weeks just be mindful of that so

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,380
again I look forward to seeing many of

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,520
you at my longer session if you want

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,920
more information please go to WWE to do

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,830
calm to learn more about us and

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:37,150
specifically about this talk there is a

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:39,880
link for HTTP collaboration or studio

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,340
comm and specifically if you want to

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,320
speak more about this topic with myself

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:48,090
and mention this talk you would get up

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,090
to five three hours for any new contract

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,130
thank you so much for joining me today

00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:00,120
for the open source and the time of

00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:03,780
kovat 19 so I want to be clear that this

00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,060
is not a talk about productivity I don't

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,670
want you to just jump in and start

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,190
putting as much a pull request and

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,870
continue to open source do what you need

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,750
to do in this time and if animal

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,670
crossing or baking sourdough or doing

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,520
nothing is helping you that's the right

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,620
thing for you to be doing we do have an

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,050
opportunity to shape and direct the way

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,630
we work to embrace more strategies and

00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,000
processes from open source and I'm happy

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:35,970
to talk about those over in chat or in

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,740
the Microsoft Azure booth area so I'm

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,280
going to get personal here and I might

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,500
get a little feels it started with a

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,840
slight fever my three-year-old son

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,880
seemed a bit irritable and his

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,310
temperature was measuring at 99 degrees

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,920
so we weren't really worried it wasn't

00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,630
high fever we've been following our stay

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,300
at home orders here in Santa Clara and

00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:00,980
the last socialization we'd had was at

00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:04,800
his preschool so it wasn't a big deal

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:09,480
until the next morning his screams woke

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:12,150
me up I can't breathe mama he was

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,450
burning up and his temperature was 104

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,290
he was gasping he was wheezing and on

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,090
one level I knew that talking was a sign

00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,310
that he was breathing because you can't

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,830
talk if he can't breathe on another

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:29,310
there was a slow panic brewing like what

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,590
is this we call their doctor and they

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,380
said come in and we went to one of these

00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,330
driving clinics and we're told to wait

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,520
in the car I hadn't thought through it

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,650
the whole idea of Frankie meeting a

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,560
doctor he doesn't know and personal

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,850
protective equipment he's only three so

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,010
we explained that the doctor was a

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:50,040
superhero who wanted to help him feel

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:53,370
better now Frankie appreciates a good

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,920
superhero story so he let the doctor

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:58,130
take his temperature take his blood

00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,690
pressure in his oxygen saturation

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,300
Frankie wasn't sick enough to be tested

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,210
but we were told assume that he is

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,850
positive

00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:10,000
ghovat so now we were going into a next

00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,950
level of isolation those in the next two

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,990
weeks tested me and way is that I just

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,510
frankly wasn't prepared for

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,690
I was watching worldwide impacts and

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:22,900
death tolls mounting I was watching my

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,380
son struggle and every night all of this

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,740
screaming then my partner's grandmother

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,250
died so I've dealt with so many personal

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,740
crisis but this was at a level at which

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,770
I've never felt before

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,290
well some people talk about having an

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,720
anxiety disorder and it like enabling

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:48,370
them in this catastrophe is a superpower

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,560
for me it felt like wow all of my coping

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,260
strategies are gone I can't go and have

00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,540
coffee with my friends and just talk and

00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,540
let go I was feeling very overwhelmed

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,250
working from home isn't new to me this

00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,980
level of anxiety and lack of certainty

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,340
was beyond anything I've experienced

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,830
before

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,250
I'm a developer advocate at Microsoft

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:15,160
supporting open source so my job is

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,960
essentially to constantly learn connect

00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,080
with people across different communities

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,630
sometimes write code speak write

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,300
documentation and support the community

00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,340
through building bridges into companies

00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,880
how do we do any of that when we are all

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:34,600
faced with this onset of some personal

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:38,200
and global scale trauma unprivileged I

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,610
have a job I have solid management that

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,520
have been thoughtful through this whole

00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,460
period and communicated next steps every

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:48,280
part of the path as we have progressed

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:51,760
through this disease I still struggled

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:55,210
my creative my creativity my purpose and

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,920
work my flow thought blocks today I want

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,140
to talk about my path to finding

00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,050
meaningful work even in this time of

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,520
crisis and how community can support you

00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,830
through building and strengthening your

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,970
relationships learning new skills and

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:13,060
contributing and meaningful ways so

00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,710
prior to all of these events I had

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,740
started talking to Carolyn who is this

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:21,190
amazingly smart awesome and

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,559
engineer here at Microsoft she has been

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,420
involved in so much different

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,130
communities with an open-source and if

00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,130
she's so well known for creating

00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,490
welcoming and inclusive communities she

00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,260
has this project called Porter and

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,390
Porter is this project to help

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,220
encapsulate all the different ways that

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,640
you might want to manage everything it

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:46,320
takes to install uninstall upgrade and

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,799
operate an application so

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,210
like hell more terraform Raz the azure

00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:56,279
CLI or AWS or cute cuddle it includes

00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,230
bash scripts or configuration files

00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,899
docker images all of these different

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,840
things so something that I'm very

00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:05,700
interested in so there are a lot of

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,909
projects out there right now that are

00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:13,380
doing kovat related initiatives that can

00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:15,299
help and support people those areas were

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,409
not something I could even consider

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:22,950
helping out the feelings even now are

00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:26,100
just still raw so that wasn't an option

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:29,159
for me but I knew that Porter appealed

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,769
to me because it was solving one of

00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,419
these complex infrastructure challenges

00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:36,240
that's often overlooked

00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:38,370
it's eeling with the glue that between

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,080
different components so rather than

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,110
dumping individuals into a project with

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,149
this long checklist of like step one set

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,000
up this docker container Oh even before

00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:49,710
that install this docker and then set

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,389
this container and then set up these

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,860
other pieces in your infrastructure

00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:56,580
before you get to the point of

00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,679
developing or installing code Porter

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,000
solves that you create a manifest and

00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:05,159
get people going faster so there are two

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,649
primary community channels outside of

00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,960
github issues for communication with the

00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,760
team zoom and slack there's this

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,859
additional maintainer meeting to get

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,569
together and talk about what's next and

00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,589
squash particular issues that have come

00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:22,109
in so once I had my face needs met right

00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:25,829
I've got security I've got a solid path

00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:27,990
to getting food from my family my child

00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:30,149
is feeling better now I was trying to

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,849
find the capacity to work again that

00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:36,210
motivation this weekly maintainer

00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:37,919
meeting was so critical for me because

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,690
it was opportunity to connect with other

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:47,819
people doing the work but also

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:49,740
connecting with people during my first

00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,300
bug squash I learned about the different

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,419
labels that are used to qualify

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,220
different issues that are raised I

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:59,310
really liked the use of the different

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,130
emojis to signal not as the urgency but

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,450
also sets the

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,210
tone for the collaboration with the team

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,220
this is like a little hack that he never

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,800
even thought about and I mean you could

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,870
debate whether chocolate or doughnuts or

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,940
Pete's are more important it was just a

00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:17,800
little bit of humanity that I needed I

00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,470
was promoted from community member to

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,270
contributor being recognized for my

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,790
contributions of providing feedback

00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,160
about the bugs and helping to close some

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,620
of them really matter to me in that

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,170
moment I felt like something's starting

00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:36,130
to unblock me I felt just a little bit

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:39,460
better so I was determined to keep

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:42,670
contributing I wanted to I wanted to

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,410
continue to feel more normal if there

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,090
can be such a thing as feeling normal

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,860
right now

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,470
Porter is written and go and that's an

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,030
opportunity for me to learn go will also

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,340
contribute open source it's not

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,600
something I already know I started

00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,760
walking through the contributing guide

00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,790
and discovered some discrepancies in the

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,230
process so with the next maintainer is

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,110
meaning when we were reviewing the road

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,030
map I asked to have improved the new

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:12,040
contributor experience at it and now I

00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:14,650
have a project as I was thinking about

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,470
all of these different pieces I realized

00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,780
that it's an alignment with the five

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,450
components that are often recognized as

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,820
being part of being happy and work this

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,090
freedom to choose what you're working on

00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,550
being challenged learning from your work

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:34,200
having a positive atmosphere to work in

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:36,790
and making meaningful contributions

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,380
happy might not be the right descriptor

00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,480
to use right now

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,180
but I do find that these same qualities

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,970
helped me bridge out of the anxiety

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,280
funnel I was in spending time talking to

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,590
awesome welcoming people working on a

00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,930
project that I didn't already know the

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,390
ins and outs and the language I don't

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:58,180
know felt like this achievable challenge

00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,190
I'm learning new things regularly like

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,440
last week I learned that with Bill

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,420
modules we don't need import comments

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,640
anymore so I can eliminate some code

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,360
rather than allowing it to just stay in

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,730
and suffer in this repository so I'm

00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,120
making meaningful contributions that

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,280
help people

00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,510
the open-source community has been doing

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,510
remote communication and collaboration

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:25,330
so we're really well prepared for social

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,910
distancing research from dr. Nicole

00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,190
Faust grin on github repositories shows

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,530
that other people must be recognizing

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,720
this value of the positive feelings as

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:39,850
well because Co contributions are

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:43,450
thriving so you can find your community

00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:47,170
your project you can help the kovat

00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:49,780
projects you can also find your areas of

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,490
entrance if you love puppies there might

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,090
be a puppy project that could use your

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,160
help right now

00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,260
if you're passionate about prutte

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,720
improving the infrastructure experience

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,440
maybe join me and Carolyn over it on

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,990
Porter find your people first then find

00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,850
your project the UNH's book on forge

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,740
your future with open source is an

00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,270
excellent resource for finding a project

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,430
if you're completely new to open source

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,890
or you even come hang out with me and

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,960
the azure booth after this talk and we

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:20,080
can help find you a project to

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,060
contribute to you I want to encourage

00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,100
you to challenge yourself and find

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,720
projects that are working in languages

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,510
and tool sets that you might not be

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,590
familiar with your contributions in

00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,820
design visual diagrams support

00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:39,160
documentation and a myriad of other

00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:42,250
areas will be meaningful we're all

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,610
suffering right now in different ways be

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,130
kind to yourself value what you can

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,680
contribute if you can contribute and

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,860
bring kindness with your contributions

00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,760
help nourish the positive environment of

00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:59,470
open source community thank you so much

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,200
for your time and the opportunity to

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,720
share my story I hope you lean into the

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,690
available support from the open source

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,990
community if you want to check out our

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:13,810
Microsoft Azure booth and learn some new

00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,420
skills there's also some documentation

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,520
here that I've linked to as again I've

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,650
mentioned before I'll be over in the

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,420
booth and I'm happy to help you make

00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,420
