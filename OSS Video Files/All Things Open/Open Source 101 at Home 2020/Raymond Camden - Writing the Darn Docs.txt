Description: 
	Writing the Darn Docs

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Raymond Camden, HERE

Abstract: This is a look at documentation writing in terms of how to format them, what to include, what *not* to include, and tips and tricks for how to ensure developers can use your product. I'll also discuss ways to help get folks to contribute to documentation.

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:19,170
so hey there we go

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,439
so I'm Raymond Camden I'm a developer

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,170
evangelist for here we do things with

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,560
maps and robbing stuff like that if that

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,170
interests you in any way at all just hit

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,809
me up later and I'll be very happy to

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,550
tell you more about that if you need to

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,850
reach out to me for any reason

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,079
whatsoever you can find me at my blog

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,710
Raymond Camden comm and I also tweet on

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,899
Twitter

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,980
that's where else would you tweet

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,559
admirin makanda and you should

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,610
absolutely follow me because i only

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,449
tweet very important critical enterprise

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,129
open source development type stuff so

00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:03,719
absolutely follow me for that crucial

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:07,680
crucial information so I want to start

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,460
off with a quick confession I want to

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,840
share some honest truth with you and

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,780
that truth is that I struggle in many

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,960
aspects not just the aspect that I'll be

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,990
talking about today but yeah I struggle

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:31,920
a lot and the meet the main reason kind

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,189
of boils down to the fact that I will go

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,460
to your documentation I will read your

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,040
documentation and then pretty much every

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,509
single time I'm gonna read it the wrong

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
way I am gonna make some dumb mistake or

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,570
there'll be something in your

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,360
documentation that is maybe the tiniest

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,450
bit vague and my brain Bowl like laser

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,790
focus on that part and just like blow up

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,759
so I'm gonna give you an example of this

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,490
and this actually involves Pillsbury

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
crescent rolls how many of you were

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,459
expecting this to be part of your

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,100
conference day today well I could say

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,650
I'm a huge huge fan of this because it's

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,460
easy to make and my kids love it and I

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,440
earn like Big Daddy hero points for for

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,440
cooking this even though it's it's

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,020
pretty trivial but something kind of

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,450
interesting happened the first time I

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,940
made this for dinner the instructions

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,870
start off really kind of simple and

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,690
clear right and so preheat oven to 375

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:42,070
no ambiguity in that right turn the oven

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,380
on set at 375 and you're good and it's

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,800
like unroll and separate into triangles

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,950
now if you don't know these uh Pillsbury

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,970
things is come out like a tube of batter

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,490
and you put it down on the platter and

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,500
there's a little seam and if you kind of

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,110
gently like I have big giant hands I

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,600
thing to tear things apart but if you're

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,410
gonna very gently unroll it you get like

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,740
a flat sheet of the cooking batter type

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:16,060
stuff so far so good pretty easy and

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,740
then the next direction is very very

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,620
kind of weird to me it says alright roll

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:24,760
up the triangles starting at the wide

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,790
end all right so this is kind of what it

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,000
looks like when you separate the

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:33,070
triangles it's just shaped so I can

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,310
still remember looking at this and

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:40,570
saying okay so an object is kind of wide

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,720
and tall so the wide end must be the

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,420
bottom end and so I rolled it up and it

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,380
didn't quite look right you know then

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,440
looked like something I was going to

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,890
turn into a crescent so then I thought

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,530
okay so maybe it just means like the the

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,940
longest part so maybe it's this side and

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,690
when I rolled it that way definitely

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:06,400
didn't make sense either so then I tried

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,530
this way as well and I I froze like I

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,210
didn't know what to do and you know I

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,890
didn't want to screw up this part of

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,180
dinner

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,460
and you're probably laughing I mean that

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,010
you know that's so stupid why why would

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,210
somebody freeze over something that is

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,150
so basic but I guarantee you that users

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,639
run

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,639
to this all the time or maybe it's just

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,960
me I will allow for that possibility as

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,440
well so to give you like a real example

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,169
of this relating to documentation part

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,880
of the reason that I'm so kind of

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,820
passionate and I spend so much time

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,259
thinking about documentation is that my

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:54,789
first example working with computers was

00:04:48,259 --> 00:05:00,350
an apple 2e or two plus way back in 1981

00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:01,729
1982 or so and what was kind of cool is

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,039
putting it back then you got a computer

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,800
it came with a manual on how to program

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,690
for it you don't quite get that nowadays

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,350
which i think is kind of unfortunate

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,560
what am I missing out on things and so I

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,240
had just seen the movie Tron I wanted to

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,539
be a programmer so I could do stuff just

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,550
like Tron and I get this book out and

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,860
look at it and it starts off really

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,720
really simple right so we're gonna write

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,729
a two line program in basic and you

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,630
could see it on screen there line ten

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:40,870
print two plus three line 20 print two

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:43,909
minus three very very simple there's no

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,510
possible way that somebody reading this

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:51,080
could screw this up except I did I

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:58,510
screwed it up I did it I ran the program

00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:01,789
and I got a syntax error now ie I

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,389
remember just like like this being again

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,220
frozen like I what could I do wrong when

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,510
it's it's that short of a computer

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,919
program like you know certainly I've

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,860
done something wrong with it thoughts

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,860
are wrong or something I did not know

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,139
what to do so after a like re typing

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,960
this in back for an hour you know stupid

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:28,520
mean come back to the docks and I

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,470
noticed that after the code listing was

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,000
this lie and a highlight makes it a

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:37,090
little bit hard to read there and

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,449
remember each line must be terminated by

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,210
pressing the return key oh yeah let me

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,970
go back look at my code so you know what

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,280
I did I saw that in the book I saw 10

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,310
Brent two plus 320 print to my history I

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,830
typed n print 2 plus 3 and then to make

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,229
it look like what the book had I hit the

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,970
spacebar until the cursor actually

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,729
wrapped all the way around the screen

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,570
and came back to the next line and then

00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:07,600
I typed the next line that's why I had

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,330
syntax errors so now you know 30 years

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,680
on I look at documentation like this and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,530
I can say you know what that line of

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,810
text we're gonna move that buddy

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,370
before the code line we're gonna take it

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,710
out of parentheses because in general

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,289
like my brain sees the parentheses and

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,090
thinks that's a side note it may not be

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:28,000
as important as what I'm really learning

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,070
there's so many things there that could

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,880
be done based on the use of feedback

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:37,870
that I went through and that kind of

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:41,260
experience I think really color my my

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,060
life and you know unfortunately I have

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,220
continued to make those types of

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,669
mistakes from them from from from then

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,940
on and I've truly kind of got this this

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,440
this notion in my brain that Doc's are

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,020
really really important whether it's

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,919
open source or not but I would say more

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,460
so for for for open source Doc's are

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,610
really everything so you know I have

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,710
through my last 30 or so years working

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:13,750
with multiple different products out

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,750
there I have got some opinions I wrote

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,180
this up about maybe two years or so ago

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,389
and I've updated it since then a few

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,979
times excuse me but I wrote like a

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,349
treatise on like what I thought was

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:29,590
important and this presentation is based

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:33,580
on this and by the way in the in the

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,800
chat channel I shared the URL for the

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,260
slide deck and I'll do so when I'm done

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,250
as well if you want to grab this lives

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,890
and get the links and stuff like that so

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,410
I also want to a quick apology I'll be

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,610
calling out some company

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,879
that I like and some open source

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,649
projects that I like for mistakes

00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,279
because these are real live examples of

00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:58,620
things I see wrong out there so sorry

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,209
but also kind of not sorry as well and

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,769
I'll point out that pretty much every

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,600
mistake that I'm pointing out is

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:09,329
probably something that I have done

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,579
myself so if we start with a basic rule

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:13,920
and that is documentation is required

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,629
that seems really really obvious

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,490
everyone in the room is probably saying

00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:20,100
yeah yeah course documentation is

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,959
required but in 2020 I feel like we

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,170
still need to say this because I still

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,259
see projects that will say all right

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,819
documentation is nice we don't

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,860
necessarily need to do it or we could

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:35,810
shift product or a ship of feature and

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,120
just document it at some later time and

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:44,970
I just think that is like a cardinal sin

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,459
and in fact I blogged a lot so I've had

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,069
my blog up since 2003

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,750
I try to blog about once a week by

00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,660
typically do about 10 blog entries a

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,579
month so I'm always blogging and in

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,290
general like I will not blog about

00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,180
something that's not document so if you

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,790
tell me here's a product and as a school

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,040
feature but not document yeah but I'll

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,750
now tell you how it works I just think

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,730
that they won't even talk about it on my

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,860
blogs I don't like people out there to

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,339
have to suffer through you know trying

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,100
to find out how something works so part

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,930
of having a good open source project is

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,389
making documentation required and

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,279
actually making that in making that a

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,980
rule you know don't literally just say

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,610
that but actually kind of make it part

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,720
of the classes so if you're adding

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,579
something to learn new feature you know

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,649
typically folks are used to saying you

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:37,709
know part of that will be running a test

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,649
framework for that feature part of the

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:42,870
process will be doing a security check

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,500
to make sure we haven't opened any holes

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,809
in our product or expose data of some

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,720
source but certainly in that same

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,939
checklist there should be a line item

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,550
for having the documentation written and

00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,620
even better if it's somebody who didn't

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,290
actually work

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,290
on that particular feature somebody else

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,750
on the project per se have them come in

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,040
have them look at what you did have them

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,720
look at your rough notes for example and

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,290
from that actually write the

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,210
documentation being that you perhaps

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,330
actually built something you were

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:24,440
extremely familiar with it and may not

00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,180
be aware of the inherent knowledge that

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,250
you have about how this works that

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,280
people who are new to the project won't

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,690
necessarily have so if you're lucky

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,970
enough to be on an open-source project

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,280
that has more than one person first of

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,310
all you're lucky but second of all you

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,340
know look at having somebody else do the

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,410
documentation for what you wrote and at

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,830
the end of the day you know we want

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:51,170
well-written perfect documentation but I

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,690
will absolutely take documentation

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,430
written by maybe someone who doesn't

00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:01,700
know English very well I'll take that

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:04,100
any time over no documentation at all as

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,590
just some more kind of things to think

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,100
about in terms of making documentation

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,070
required I did some checking to see what

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,770
kind of ways that were out there to kind

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,830
of enforce that I couldn't really find a

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,680
way to say you know on this project if I

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,720
add code and this particular folder then

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,430
I have to have a corresponding piece of

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,050
documentation as well

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,360
I couldn't find a way to automate that

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,090
there are things that are kind of

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,930
related to it text length for example

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:39,410
we'll look at your documentation and

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,950
look for things like terminology that

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,450
may not be explained look for gendered

00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,030
content so I could say things like he

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,560
does this will kind of flag that as I

00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,260
something that you may want to look at

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,680
so it's not really for you know making

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,810
sure you did right but can look at the

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,540
quality of your documentation and try to

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,940
make it a little bit nicer Swagger I

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,100
will say I saw just on their website

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,190
they seem to have something in their

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,200
process for ensuring that you actually

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,790
write something I only know a little bit

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,830
of swagger but I'll

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,770
just share that as something that you

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,660
may want to look at if you are already

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:22,910
using swagger in your particular

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:25,940
projects the other aspect that comes to

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,010
mind to me a lot is what to include in

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,890
your documentation and also when to

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,430
include it so the answer to what to

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,800
include you may just want to say hey we

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,920
should include everything right because

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,320
you know there's nothing wrong with

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,240
giving the user too much text right

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,290
nothing can go wrong with that I have a

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,010
great counter example to my why you may

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:55,640
want to reconsider how much you put out

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,000
there about two jobs or so ago I worked

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,860
on a table zero and I was in the group

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,130
that worked on a project called web

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,600
tasks what task was a really really cool

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,790
project was one of the easiest way to

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,050
build serverless functions I could do it

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,330
all online at a great editor you know

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,550
terms of working with server lists it

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,340
was one of the easiest solutions out

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:23,690
there unfortunately they had to shut it

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,390
down because Bitcoin miners were making

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,420
use of it to Bitcoin mine or mine

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,430
Bitcoin whatever they do but the

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,200
documentation at least when I started

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,180
there I had this little interesting

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,760
issue so I had a great kind of getting

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,680
started that really did kind of get you

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,270
up and running in 30 seconds it got you

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,260
an easy win which is something I'm going

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:48,950
to get back to and a few minutes it

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,020
started off really good now I typically

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,390
will start on page one in the

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,480
documentation and then go to page two

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,490
and you know so forth

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,290
starts off good and then the very next

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,810
page is extensibility in a multi-tenant

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,990
platform when I joined the company I

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,700
didn't know but multi-tenant was and you

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,810
know I kind of went into web cast and

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,600
you know it's a way to make service

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,450
functions and then it starts talking

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,260
about running untrusted customer code

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:24,410
and multi tenants and a trading platform

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:30,050
and everything that was on this

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:33,290
Paige was true information it was useful

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,980
to somebody but absolutely not useful to

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,129
me

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,050
in terms of actually learning how to use

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,730
this particular product and then it only

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,040
got worse going to the third page I

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,350
remember thinking okay this is not for

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,149
me I'll just skip ahead and then the

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,610
next page you know I think if you see an

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:52,279
Aristotle quote then Harding already

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,110
you're kind of like having a red flag up

00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,930
there like what the heck is going on

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,509
here and this particular page was

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,740
talking about client-server programs and

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:07,910
architecture and all that and again

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:10,610
factual information yeah you know

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,459
client-server stuff is old I get that

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,720
but nothing in that is actually helping

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:20,029
me use web tasks you know and I don't

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,850
really care per se about what happened

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,420
in the 60 so one of the things that I

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,639
did while I was at the company was to

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,829
kind of look at the documentation and

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,920
then come back later and deploy a much

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:37,579
slimmer version of that where we still

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,380
had that getting started you know we had

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,380
a good simple intro for that quick win

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,329
and then immediately went into you know

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,930
actually writing service functions so

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,449
way the programming model and the main

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,100
thing passed into your service function

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,680
was a context object so that was the

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,019
very next topic and one of the things

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,480
that people typically would want to do

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,069
is pass parameters and the easiest way

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,309
to do that was via Chris Frank so that

00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:06,620
was the next topic so I pretty much got

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,490
rid of anything that didn't pertain to

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:14,809
actually learning how to use web tasks

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:17,089
and focused more on you know the actual

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:20,600
nuts and bolts of working with this

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:24,100
particular product and I will pause for

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,100
a dramatic moment to have a sip of water

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,730
so in terms of you know when do you

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,270
actually include something so you know

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,410
if you've determined that I do need to

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,410
document you know

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:42,110
and why what should come first

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,700
and you know what should I put in front

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,380
of the user first so I in my mind I kind

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,880
of make two buckets in terms of using a

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,670
product there are things that you have

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,370
to know and typically that's a much

00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:58,160
smaller bucket so like you you have to

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,290
install the product to actually use it

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,660
yet to do the NPM install to to grab it

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:07,520
down but then there's a whole set of

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:11,720
things that you may want to do that that

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,960
you may even never do so in general I

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,570
tend to focus on you know what do I need

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,360
to do to do anything at all and get that

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,130
information to the user up front so when

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,710
I'm looking at a project in general

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:29,330
let's say it has no documentation at all

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,490
I absolutely love the start with a you

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,980
know kind of quick introduction of some

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,020
sort of explaining what it is and that

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,540
could literally be like two sentences

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,510
depending on the size of project that

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,370
I'm working on talk about the insulation

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:49,790
and this could be complex but in terms

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,250
of a new user coming to my site I will

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:55,430
typically prefer to focus on the most

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:59,870
simplest and direct insulation route and

00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:03,410
as a counterexample and let me just open

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,710
this up and let me just see yes all

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,180
right

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,360
wasn't sure if the new tab was showing

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,000
up as well this is beautify I'd like you

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,910
to find a line but it's insulation Doc's

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,880
are very very extensive and to me a bit

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,920
overwhelming as well so you have a CLI

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,290
install you have an next install yeah

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,380
web pack you have electron you have PWA

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,710
you have cordova you have capacitor and

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:32,480
everything here is useful it's it's

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,240
factual but I would possibly suggest in

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,040
the QuickStart it's a bit overwhelming

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,690
so I think the QuickStart in this

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,030
example it would have been great to have

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,720
just a CLI install because that would

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,280
apply to everybody or would apply to

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,330
someone who is learning to beautify and

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,059
once that hello world that

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,669
kinda quick demo up and running and then

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:56,309
perhaps have a whole second section just

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,950
on insulation I even call it insulation

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:02,100
techniques where each of these different

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:05,480
ones is listed out you know perhaps an

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,000
order of what the most common one is so

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,370
you know PWA is probably more important

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,279
and then electron orchid OVA I would

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,059
have that higher up in that particular

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,309
chain in case you could see right there

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,679
again my personal preference so again I

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,990
like it getting started I like giving

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,850
the person that quick win so that they

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,600
feel that that they've done something

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,730
with them so the quicker that I can get

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,010
you to get my my particular project

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,010
installed and get it showing the shiny

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:41,130
fun thing on screen I think that's

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,460
better for that user and encourages them

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:47,480
to to carry on and then after that

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,850
everything else and everything else

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,309
again the order can be you know based on

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,950
what you think is important so this is

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:58,830
view router and what I discovered is

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,380
that getting started actually like met

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:05,130
like 50% of my use cases like I stopped

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,620
there because for the first couple of

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,350
projects I used that's all I needed and

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,659
it took me a while before I needed to do

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,610
anything more and I was able to kind of

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,860
jump ahead for example programmatic

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,230
navigation I remember I needed that

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,769
before dynamic route matching before

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:25,590
nested browse but because the getting

00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:28,230
started kind of gave me that inherent

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:33,539
knowledge of what I needed I was kind of

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:35,909
good to go from there but wait and so

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm gonna contradict myself a bit as

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,120
well

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,799
when you kind of think about how people

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,899
with your dogs don't forget that they

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,679
absolutely will also come to your docks

00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:49,740
and not start at getting started so for

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:54,090
example if you google for stripe API

00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:56,520
products you will end up on this

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,260
particular page I'm just verifying in

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,620
the room

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,929
yep it's showing up there okay so by the

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,580
way I really like stripe a lot so I

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,950
mentioned earlier I was not picking up

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,320
you know people a few times this is an

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,120
example of it so and in fact our

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,919
particular Docs from my company we make

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,010
the same as that mistake that I'm

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:18,530
showing here so Google sent me to the

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:21,290
right place in terms of the stripe API

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,450
for products but the big thing that I

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,660
see missing here is that I have no idea

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:29,240
what the URL is for this endpoint

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,120
I see it's definitely slash 1 V 1 slash

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,100
products but somebody said hey you know

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,200
what we only have one room URL let's

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,380
include that at the very beginning and

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,179
don't repeat it every single time

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,150
however because I didn't come in via the

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,309
front door I don't know what that URLs

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,600
now obviously I could find it I could

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:54,440
scroll up this will stop me for five

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,260
seconds at the most but just visually

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,000
looking at this particular box here at

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,880
the endpoints there's a lot of space

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,790
there you could probably fit that URL in

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,429
there and just save me that five or six

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,210
seconds they also make another mistake

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,120
here

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,549
that again our Doc's have this issue as

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,070
well in some places where it's actually

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:19,850
pretty easy to get to that full URL if I

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,169
just click on that v1 products I didn't

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,390
know that and the reason I didn't know

00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,880
that is because unlike tradition

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,040
there's no underline for that link now

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,140
we've been kind of trained where we know

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,120
that if I see a navigation on the left

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,850
hand side I'm pretty sure those are

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,160
links and the plain text paragraph you

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,059
see here in the middle the different

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,799
colors stands out as you know links over

00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:44,120
here on the right hand side it was white

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,940
text with no underline

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,790
I really did not know that again I could

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:54,230
be dumb I didn't know that I could click

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:57,380
on that and then get to the link it was

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,020
only when I scrolled my mouse over that

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:04,490
I actually noticed that so just

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:07,640
something to keep in mind as well so in

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,870
terms of code samples yes you know we're

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,110
talking about open source technology

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:16,140
projects typically involves code you

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,450
normally want to actually have a code

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,190
sample but it's important question to

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,820
think about how much you want to include

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,620
so as an example I wanted you to imagine

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,380
that I'm trying to teach you about the

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,650
placeholder option for a foreign field

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,110
so one way that I could do that would be

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:37,080
it can show you an HTML page so this is

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:40,490
a full HTML page it has a header in the

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:45,360
body the full form all the attributes

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:48,600
this is a proper good HTML page thumbs

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,980
up to me and yada yada yada however you

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,110
know I if I'm teaching you about

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,049
placeholder the code that's actually

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,799
relevant to my knowledge is a very small

00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,480
part of this particular page so I may

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,620
consider doing something a bit simpler

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,360
like only showing the form or I could

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,890
say you know if you've come in here

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,409
because you're learning about form

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,990
tricks or I have a library that's

00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:16,049
related to making forms easier to use

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,809
it's probably safe to assume that you

00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,240
already know about forms syntax and I

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:23,490
could focus just on the aspect that I'm

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,440
actually modifying in this case the

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,210
input type now I want to be clear that

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,010
I'm not saying that you should

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:33,149
absolutely bring it down to the smallest

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:36,029
part you just want to give some thought

00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:38,070
to the balance between what you're

00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,630
teaching you know what your Docs are

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,390
illustrating at that particular point

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,399
and the rest of the code in that

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,799
particular block you know you want to

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,149
think about you know how much the user

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,279
is going to have to parse you know you

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:53,039
can like if you go back to that first

00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,190
example your brain is gonna work like a

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,020
web browser and then parse that and you

00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,970
know they have to find the part that's

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,340
important for them to learn what's going

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,630
on here so things that you could do to

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,529
make that a bit easier

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:10,860
could be nice I think view does an

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:12,659
amazing job at this where you know all

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,600
their examples typically involve

00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:18,450
JavaScript and HTML they could do a

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,090
complete HTML page with a script block

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:23,250
at the bottom but instead they have two

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,410
two code blocks and

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,800
hopefully y'all can see it it's a bit

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:32,370
faded but this say HTML on the top blog

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:35,310
and jeaious on the second blog they did

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,050
that and they be understood that you

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,240
know if you're a view developer you most

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,070
likely are past the point of building a

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,320
basic HTML page I don't want to show you

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,550
the HTML tag the head tag the body tag

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,960
etc and much like if you're learning

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:51,510
view then you should know JavaScript

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,700
ahead of time I don't to show you that

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:58,590
this is you know so-and-so died J's file

00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,450
or that it's within a particular script

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:04,200
block for example so I think they do a

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,210
really good job here in kind of you know

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,210
highlighting the important parts and not

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,760
making you read noise you know valid

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,440
HTML or valid JavaScript but they're

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,540
getting rid of the noise and then kind

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,520
of focusing more on the crucial bit so I

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,770
would say like one of the best things

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,500
that you could do is include that short

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,510
snippet but then link to a full example

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,720
where you do have full HTML pages and

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,470
things like that just is pretty good for

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,570
that

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,700
I think code pen is probably the best

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,600
because the person can actually run the

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:42,180
code and then modify it they could tweak

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,240
it so yeah so the hello world I could

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,880
say hello ray that makes a user feel

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,190
powerful and then allows them to kind of

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,350
go beyond what your Doc's have and

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,950
actually sort of playing with it as well

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,410
I tend to use code sandbox only in cases

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,110
where there's a good built process of

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,050
some sort so I'm doing a simple view

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,660
blog post I'll use code pin if it's a

00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,420
more enhanced view application I'll use

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:13,080
code sandbox and again that's just my

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:17,850
particular way of using those particular

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:21,030
tools if you are showing code blogs 20

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:24,030
is a code formatter I use prism on my

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:26,690
blog I'm using revealed ijs for the

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:30,470
slide deck and it uses highlight jeaious

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:33,030
both of these make it pretty easy to use

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,210
basically you know wrap your blocks of

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:39,169
code and then let the library comes

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,450
and makes it look a bit nicer so in

00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:45,860
terms of things to avoid don't do a

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:48,110
picture of code again yeah I have many

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,240
things on look I have many things on

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,429
this light that I feel like super

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,250
obvious and then I shouldn't have on

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:57,620
here but then day to day I still run

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:02,330
into people doing this and the other one

00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:05,840
is code you can't copy and I saw this

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:08,690
last week where for some reason the the

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,720
CSS was set up to prevent me from

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,090
copying some code off a page now I know

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,270
what happened in that case somebody did

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,059
a CSS change to make something else look

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:23,080
nice and the side effect was preventing

00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:25,070
me from copying code from a web page and

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,860
that's a god thing or I would say hey

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,830
you know what you know that particular

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,299
UI enhancement makes sense but if you're

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,710
making it more difficult for me as a

00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,110
developer I would rather it look a

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:40,490
little bit uglier and then actually have

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:43,510
the ability to to copy by the way don't

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:47,059
do stuff that changes people's clipboard

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,760
there's almost never a reason to do that

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,309
I'll mention an example in a bit about

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,230
why you would want to you but don't do

00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:55,760
that stupid thing where you copy text my

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,380
webpage and then you change it so that

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,539
when they paste it it says pasted from

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,840
blah blah yeah just just don't do that

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:05,809
especially for developer documentation

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,010
another consideration this is from the

00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:12,020
11a documentation I love the lemon 11e

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,480
it's a static site generator it's the

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,750
one I use for my blog it's the best

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,130
thing ever invented ever but from their

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,409
quick start there's something a little

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,289
bit interesting in here so they have

00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:27,679
this command echo single quote pound you

00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:31,279
know yada yada yada so if you do this

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,980
and then look at the output when you run

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,220
11e to get the generated output you

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,460
actually get incorrect output and the

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,260
only reason that you do is because the

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,049
echo command the one that they have

00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,590
on-screen here works differently on

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,090
Windows versus Linux now I know that

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,590
every

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:56,770
loves or MacBook Pros everyone loves OSX

00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,560
I love Abu - I use that on Windows but

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:02,410
there are a few people one or two who

00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,430
use Windows who use command exe who use

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:08,050
PowerShell and I cannot tell you how

00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:11,110
many projects I see where they just

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:13,270
assume that that you know or that you're

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,190
on UNIX and that you if you're not then

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,710
you know what the equivalent command is

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,800
another one I see quite often as well is

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:24,220
to use touch touch does not work on

00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,830
Windows so you know it's a minor thing

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,210
like if you say hey touch this file with

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:32,290
the assumption that makes a blank file

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,690
to use later if I see that I know and

00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,930
also I am on a bun - on Windows so it's

00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:40,270
not really an issue but simple small

00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,980
things like this can stop a user and

00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,560
stop them from reading you know kind of

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,570
imagine the deer-in-headlights type

00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,360
thing that you don't want developers to

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,400
go through another great example is from

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,500
a company called pipe dream another

00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,620
service I think is pretty cool they have

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,680
a curl command and it is delimited at

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,680
over two lines and if I copy and paste

00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,930
this and the windows I'm sorry if I do I

00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,700
get in here Windows actually does

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:12,520
support multi-line commands but it's a

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:16,270
carrot I think it's the hat it's a hat

00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:19,480
symbol which will work in command

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:22,960
exe unfortunately he doesn't work in

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,220
PowerShell so when I googled this there

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,510
is a way to make it work in PowerShell

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,220
but it was so weird

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,740
I was like yeah no I'm just not gonna

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,100
bother doing a slide for it but again

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:36,340
it's it seems so minor like a user will

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,650
mind though they'll know what to do but

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,660
at the same time you know do the right

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,600
thing they make it work you know find an

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,580
example so I forget what documentation

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,390
all right Spotify everyday what's on the

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,050
screen so they basically they made the

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,210
curl command readable but it's not using

00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:58,540
something that would break on my system

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,220
now by the same token it's not copy and

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,170
paste of all or if it is I have to copy

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,560
to time

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:08,170
but I think that's a good balance now a

00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,650
few minutes ago I mentioned never messed

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:14,020
with somebody's clipboard last week I

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,700
actually blogged an example where you

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,090
could present something like this on

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:22,090
screen have a copy command and when it

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,620
copies it copies it has one line so that

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,170
the person could actually paste that

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:30,810
into any operating system that supports

00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,810
girl and not to worry about line breaks

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,460
so a quick recap of what I said so far

00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,680
you absolutely you absolutely want to

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,660
have a policy where Doc's are required I

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,520
really think it needs to be spelled out

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:46,150
because if you don't spell it out people

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,580
won't do it and again I absolutely to

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,580
this day see projects where they just

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,470
don't care something that's documented

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,350
think about what you should document and

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:59,440
when and also you know give good thought

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,990
to your organization of when you present

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,640
information so that's kind of some high

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:07,390
level things to consider I have a couple

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,370
last set of tips to share with you kind

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,610
of my pet peeves or kind of smaller

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:15,820
things to think about so animated gifs

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:18,070
everyone loves animated gifs I hate them

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,380
this is a great example and I'm not sure

00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:23,200
how well this is gonna string but this

00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,020
is a CLI command that will print an

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,570
animated gif to your terminal and in

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,900
this animated gif the CLI command is

00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,240
actually onscreen for about one second

00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,670
and then the gif is on screen for eight

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,400
seconds I can't tell you how many things

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:42,340
I've come across where they had a good

00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,710
example in the jiff not in the text and

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,940
I wanted to try what they think that

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,400
that's what that's how I learned all

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,620
right you talked about a feature I want

00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,440
to run it myself and have to wait for

00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,660
the damn animated jiff the cycle or it

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,760
goes so fast you know that there's

00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,460
something like four arguments I type in

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,180
one I wait I've been another one and I

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:07,990
wait I just in general I would say try

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:10,210
to avoid animated gifs in documentation

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,010
as much as possible in this particular

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,770
example I would have had the command

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,680
there's a screenshot of the enemy jet or

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:23,090
an MAF of just the jet being rendered

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:26,230
not the command on screen so yeah enemy

00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:29,210
Jets just don't do it do it don't do it

00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:32,480
in terms of jokes when I give

00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,220
presentations you know less so online

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,960
because you can't see people and you

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,420
can't see if they're groaning or smiling

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,990
or laughing I tend to include a lot of

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,830
jokes in my documentation I rarely

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:48,650
rarely joke because you know I think I'm

00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,650
a pretty silly person even at 47 I still

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,660
feel like I'm silly and light-hearted

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,420
but when it comes to Docs I kind of just

00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,700
want to get things done so I will rarely

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,760
use jokes in my technical documentation

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,770
I will do like nerdy things and my code

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,450
samples so I'll use names like Luke

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:10,190
Skywalker for a you know variable name

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:15,140
or a variable value or stuff like that

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:17,270
I'll typically express my creativity in

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,300
sample data and stuff like that and in

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:22,520
actual Tech's keep the joking to a

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,550
caution in blog posts I'm a bit more

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,350
looser but in Docs I you know I

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,150
understand that you're probably

00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:33,790
struggling to get something done Friday

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:36,320
at 5 p.m. and you don't want the humor I

00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:39,860
required login I have seen this a couple

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,350
times where a person's project was so

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,930
crucial that they want you to log in to

00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:47,060
actually read the docs just don't do

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,490
that that's not so much an issue with

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,280
open source projects I never seen that

00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:55,910
with open source but I just bring that

00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:00,980
up to state don't don't ever even

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,990
consider doing that and I will say going

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,150
back to that I'm going to bet that most

00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:07,610
of the time when you see that somebody

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,770
had a KPI for their manager to say we

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,360
need you know user signups like oh I

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,940
know I know a great way to get people to

00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,280
sign up I'll force them to sign up just

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,300
to look at her Docs so yeah don't do

00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,890
that

00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:24,440
offer a way to have people help out and

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,970
make it kind of obvious what are the

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,760
simplest ways just to have a

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:31,400
link to github to edit and have an

00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,190
example here this is the native script

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,890
view documentation on the introduction

00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:40,250
and if you scroll down you'll see a link

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:43,790
and prove this document and if you click

00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:47,150
it you go to the github markdown page

00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,490
for this and github to their credit has

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,690
done really great work to make this as

00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:54,740
painless as possible

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:57,590
I use get every single day but if I had

00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,400
to fork your project just to fix a typo

00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:03,220
via the CLI honestly I probably wouldn't

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,020
do it like it feels like a lot of work

00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,150
github has made this as painless as

00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,030
clicking the edit it will fork it for

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,010
you you do your edit and then it's like

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,260
hey do you want to do a PR it's right

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,940
here just click this next button it like

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,990
holds your hand throughout the whole

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,150
process and makes it very painless to do

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:27,740
an improvement like that

00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:31,849
that being said still improve I still

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:34,310
add some form of contact 1 you know some

00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,960
way of a poor person to reach out so

00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,670
that vikins write you an email and say

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,099
hey there's a typo on this page please

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:43,010
fix it that way if they don't have a

00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:45,500
github account they can still send you

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,170
that quick feedback by the way a Twitter

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,270
link is not a feedback form it's not the

00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:54,589
same if you are lucky to have people

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,750
more than one person on your project

00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,930
then you know look at having somebody be

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,200
the official talks Docs person this is

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,330
great for the less technical aspect of

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,210
your organization so someone who may not

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:10,520
be a hardcore programmer but like me who

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,920
struggles a lot I would be perfect to

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,869
write your ducks because every every

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,240
possible thing that could go wrong I

00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:18,859
will find it and I will have that

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,300
problem and I'll make sure the docs

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:27,859
cover people like me in terms of formats

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:30,080
I course HTML but look at supporting

00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:31,400
offline usage because what are the first

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,500
things I think about is that oh this

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,180
project is great I'm getting on an

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,280
airplane yeah pretend that we still fly

00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,920
you know I know we don't fly anymore

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,349
I'm getting on an airplane I wish I had

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,210
a way to get this on the airplane so I

00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:47,869
could still hack without paying 15 bucks

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,710
for a poor Wi-Fi so if you do have a

00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:51,260
good PWA

00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,900
online support for your docs actually

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,670
tell the user that don't just do it like

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,089
tell them someplace like hey we're using

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:03,380
fancy PWA technology to support this

00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:06,829
offline it's done do that look at

00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:10,609
swagger for doing anything for api's and

00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:15,140
then also look at PDF now I know it's

00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:16,790
probably like a PDF really but for large

00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,450
sets of documentation

00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:22,280
I just find PDF a bit easier to read so

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,550
if you're at the point of having a

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,339
couple hundred pages of documentation

00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,920
which is definitely possible PDF gives

00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,220
me one nice file definitely with offline

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,440
support that could be a bit easier on

00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,020
the eyes and also I kind of like having

00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,900
a PDF open and having a web browser open

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:46,310
from my work the PDF or the dots my

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:48,170
browser while I do stuff so in terms of

00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,300
what next I would highly suggest

00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,630
checking out right the dots that work

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:57,410
it's an entire organization just about

00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:00,380
writing documentation with a huge amount

00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:04,940
of resources you absolutely want to

00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:11,329
check that out and with that I am going

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:15,920
to look back on the screen and see if I

00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:19,460
can see some questions and by the way so

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,230
I am going to go from the backward to

00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,270
the from the bottom up I've seen a few

00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,859
people mention open API I absolutely

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:29,599
should have mentioned that alongside

00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:32,450
with swagger I apologize um Thank You

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,839
Matthew Foley Lennon Floyd my favorite

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:38,390
language I'm primarily JavaScript or

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,050
English that answers both of your

00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,050
questions I think

00:41:47,519 --> 00:42:00,019
I'm sinking talks about hoppin cool oh I

00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:13,440
I told y'all I would share the slide URL

00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:16,740
on github then markup yeah like markup a

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:21,029
lot to Visual Studio code makes it much

00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:23,220
much easier to work with Mateus

00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:26,309
I apologize if I say your name

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:31,230
incorrectly I have not used git book so

00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:33,809
I can't comment on that in terms of Carl

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,390
in terms of platforms I really like the

00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:38,220
way github will will serve HTML and

00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,160
write down files without having to think

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,079
about hosting at all so if you're using

00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,680
github or ready for documentation you

00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,740
have a built in HTML viewer I guess as a

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,480
way of saying it for that for static

00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,180
sites in general which is typically how

00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:58,440
I would build documentation I would look

00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:07,140
at net the fie that's right sir my my

00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:09,089
blog cool no II mean so is that pan doc

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,609
will do markdown the PDF I've not gone

00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:13,529
from markdown to PDF before guys for now

00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:17,150
I've done HTML the PDF not markdown the

00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:17,150
PDF that's pretty cool

00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:25,890
kimili so I have a degree in technical

00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,869
writing it was the English degree with a

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,460
focus on technical writing but right out

00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:31,920
of college I went to the web industry

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,910
where I did kind of everything so I

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,769
never got a job as a technical writer so

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,960
unfortunately I can really help with

00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:44,250
that certainly having a lot of examples

00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,400
helps again I used my blog as a way to

00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:51,000
have an online presence for my technical

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,250
writing and that I believe helped me get

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,160
jobs writing books and running articles

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,950
and things like that for those who may

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:04,619
not have a blog take a look at

00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:06,660
practical dev or debbie oh I got in they

00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,430
have a blogging platform that's very

00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,809
friendly to developer it's not like

00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:15,690
medium and would get you up and writing

00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:20,280
right away very easy to use editor very

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:22,859
great interface and free actually blog

00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,930
on death dot too as well but it's like a

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:31,440
reblog from my personal blog of that

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:48,329
makes sense and no one has asked but yes

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:50,640
that is a def star behind me the

00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:52,730
croissants are fine I still like I still

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,930
struggle I still like stop for a second

00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,579
but what I what I have turned what I

00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,220
found out is that the kids don't care

00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:06,020
how croissant they look or how Crescent

00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:06,020
eat they look they just eat it so yeah

00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:15,450
yeah I look over a little bit you can

00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:17,250
see more Legos yeah if there was an easy

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:22,440
way to turn my webcam around I would

00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:28,530
show you the rest of the office it's a

00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:30,450
little bit full Amy I won't speak for

00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,770
the organizers but I'm pretty sure they

00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,990
said that they're gonna make everything

00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:36,510
available later especially since there

00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:39,299
are so many sessions going on at once so

00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:45,089
I am 99% sure that it is being recorded

00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:47,780
and will be available later YouTube

00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:47,780
channel here we go

00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,280
by the way thank you to everyone who

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,020
listened I'm just gonna hang out here

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,910
for the next few minutes and try to

00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,320
answer any more questions but thank you

00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:12,740
for for hearing me out I definitely

00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:12,740
appreciate it you're all welcome as well

00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:36,900
you are all welcome my contact

00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:43,460
information one more time Twitter I'm

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:43,460
Raymond Camden and blog is Camden

00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,830
Wesley I think it's one of those things

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:22,870
where like until you feel the pain

00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:26,200
yourself it's hard to understand I think

00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:29,140
you know it may be it may be indicative

00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,150
of the web community where there's so

00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,790
many of us that don't have a traditional

00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,940
background there's so many of us who

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:39,700
come from English the social study you

00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:43,510
know the liberal arts for example versus

00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:45,730
pure hardcore engineering there you know

00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:52,890
for us augmentation I think maybe a bit

00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:57,100
more a bit more apparent you know it's

00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:59,530
it's being a clarion call I know at my

00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:02,470
organization you know I love my company

00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:05,680
we're not perfect but at my company we

00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:08,140
you know those of us in developer

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,270
relations we look at it as like our

00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:13,720
primary goals then sure our Docs are

00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:15,190
clear and we we nag engineering if they

00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,630
excuse me they put something out there

00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,420
that that's not clear

00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,940
thank you such a small little small

00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,620
little point we will it will harp on

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,850
that like you have to make the docks

00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:29,320
clear you have to make anything that's

00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,870
obscure or anything that could be

00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,870
misread that we have to do a great job

00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,760
on that and I think that they get in I

00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,350
think that's not their you know the

00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,200
thing they think about all the time and

00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:44,440
so that's where can we come in and think

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,870
about the user in terms of ensuring that

00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:51,760
that is is done you know outside of

00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,350
making clear that this is all someone

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,390
comes to your product this you know

00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,620
you're it's maybe open source but you

00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,320
still have a product you still want

00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,330
people to use what you have built you

00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,210
want them to contribute to to what you

00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,980
have built so having the documentation

00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,600
makes it easier for them the on board

00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,260
and purchase them to actually do

00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,260
something to help out

00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:33,280
so so Wesley I would think that harp on

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,600
that like in your class when you want to

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,180
talk about documentation that's a

00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:40,000
perfect way like here's a live example

00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,230
right now we are struggling because the

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,870
last semester didn't document this and

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:50,080
if I was you I would find a project like

00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:52,210
that like leave a loan for kit keep it

00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,070
there and then use that every class

00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,530
alright let's actually use this oh no we

00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:59,050
can't because they didn't document how

00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:05,070
to do something BAM that that's your

00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:05,070
lesson like right there Thank You Thomas

00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:46,200
you were all welcome so I'm not sure

00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:48,359
exactly how to end this I know the next

00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:53,010
session is like in three or so minutes

00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:54,390
so so most of y'all gonna hop out again
