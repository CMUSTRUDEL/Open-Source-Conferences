Description: 
	Predict the Future with Watson Studio AutoAI

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Jenna Ritten, IBM

Abstract: Learn how to build and deploy your very own AI predictive models from IBM Developer Advocate Jenna Ritten. IBM Watson Studio AutoAI automatically analyzes your data and generates customized predictive model pipelines. It categorizes data as needed, does features engineering and optimizes hyperparameters to get to the best possible model. We will show you how to integrate Watson Studio AutoAI into your projects.

Using AutoAI, you can build and deploy a machine learning model with sophisticated training features and no coding. The tool does most of the work for you. We will walk you through how to deploy your customs models to your application.

The AutoAI process follows this sequence to build candidate pipelines:

- Data Pre-Processing
- Automated Model Selection
- Automated Feature Engineering
- Hyperparameter Optimization

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,799
so to get started

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
um i would just like to first say thank

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,680
you all for taking the time out to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,039
come to my session i hope your weeks are

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
going a little better

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,920
um especially since uh

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,560
you're all able to attend this really

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,840
cool virtual conference

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
with all things open source

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
sorry

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,079
my name is jenna written i'm a developer

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
advocate at ibm

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680
um i do a lot of work with cloud

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,520
developer

00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,320
api tooling blockchain

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
i've been doing a lot with some watson

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,479
studio

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,920
features like auto ai um

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,479
i primarily work in react and

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,759
python and javascript and php

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,200
uh and this is my social media handle so

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,880
feel free to connect with me

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
on twitter linkedin um youtube i've been

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,360
live streaming a lot of my

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
uh workshops more recently um so you'll

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,280
be able to find them there as well

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,840
um one thing i would like to do

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,439
is for all of you to just take a second

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
and answer these questions about

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,200
yourself

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,360
in the chat um so we can all kind of

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
get to know each other uh maybe you can

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
can connect with someone else who's um

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
in the session uh maybe they're from the

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
same city maybe you're interested in the

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
same topics

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
um

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,119
so for example my name is jenna i'm a

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,079
cloud developer advocate at ibm

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,439
um i'm currently joining from detroit so

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,880
i'm from detroit

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,920
um i work in austin um i'm here

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
for the time being working from home um

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
something i love

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,920
uh are my dogs which you probably heard

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,280
growling and fighting with each other

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,720
um i have little yorkies and

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
they just refuse to ever be tired for

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
some reason

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,000
and a cork so something that's uniquely

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,760
weird or different about you

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,440
so um

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,599
for myself um i have an obsession with

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
tuna so tuna salad sandwiches two

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
amounts if it's on a menu

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
i feel compelled to order it i just

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,319
can't help myself

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:51,840
and if it's not very good i do not end

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,840
up returning to that particular place

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,519
so thank you all for um sharing where

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
you're joining from some of your

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
students some of you are professionals

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,239
um this

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,440
uh workshop is for everyone so

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
it's not uh particularly for data

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
scientists

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,480
however it can exponentially help them

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
do their jobs

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
it's not specifically for developers

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
however

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,319
this is a way for someone with little to

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
no data science

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
background or experience can get up and

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,159
running quickly

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,360
using ai machine learning

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,560
tooling and having a lot of the

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,080
back-end data science uh automated and

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
done for you

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
by ibm watson and allow you to deploy

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
your models and incorporate them and

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,799
integrate

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:50,000
them into your personal projects

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
so to get started

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
this is the link for the slides i've

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,560
posted it in the chat i also will be

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,080
posting uh the links and resources and a

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
slide as well with them at the end of

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,159
the session

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,159
so uh do not worry you have time

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,239
and this is the um

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,320
link to create an ibm cloud account if

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,759
you don't already have one

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,160
um a an ibm

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
cloud an ibm cloud account is required

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
in order to

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
uh work through the entire workshop

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,040
however

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,120
um you will be signing up for a

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
free light tier so it's at no cost to

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,919
you and you can take advantage of

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
all of the different uh offerings we

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,240
have in our

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,040
ibm cloud catalog with the

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
light tier option

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
so you might be thinking you know i i

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
don't know

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
ai or machine learning right like i

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
don't really know

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
where to get started i don't really know

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
what these things are

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
um so we're gonna kind of look at that

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
today from a more

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,320
high level and show you how to just get

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,199
up and get starting without getting

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,880
uh too into the weeds um

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,759
yes thank you todd um if you need any if

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,680
you need anything

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
uh feel free to message todd or any of

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
the other um

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,199
uh any of the other organizers if you

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,639
need help with anything

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,240
um yeah so this is this is a quick start

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,039
to get you up and running

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
um uh without getting too much into the

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,440
weeds or having to learn

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,080
too much about um ai and machine

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
learning

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
uh beforehand so think of machine

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
learning as a sophisticated if else

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
statement so if you're a developer

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,160
you're writing and you're writing

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,360
functions and trying to build out

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
applications

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,120
um or apis you're writing a lot of these

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,240
if else statements right

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,919
so what you're doing is

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,440
you're giving data feeding data

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,240
into watson studio to you'll be creating

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
a

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,240
custom machine learning model that'll

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
serve as a sophisticated

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,800
if else statement so if um

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,520
it receives some data um it will

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,280
process it a certain way else it will do

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
something else right so what we're doing

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,440
is we're giving it data so

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,720
it can try an assortment of algorithms

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
to optimize the model so that it can

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
make those determinations for you if

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
you're a data scientist

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,440
you probably have spent days weeks or

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
months

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,080
building your own machine learning

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,199
models

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,720
writing writing algorithms to create and

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,759
generate those models

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,280
it can be very time consuming

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,960
watson can uh take a lot of the burden

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
off of you and do that very quickly for

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,720
you

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,759
so machine learning in a nutshell

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,199
is just a way to make data useful right

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,720
you have all of this data and what do

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
you do with it so machine learning is a

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
way to take that data and really put it

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
into option

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,319
so that you can use it in your own

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
projects

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
or at your own companies and i will be

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
showing you

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
an example in just a second an ai is

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
just

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,880
intelligence without human intervention

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,160
right we want

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,759
to create models

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,639
and what i mean by models are a model is

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
um something that you can feed data to

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
and it will give you a predictive

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,039
response

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:39,280
um so what we want to do

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,639
is do that very quickly and easy

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,639
easily ai

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,120
essentially the purpose of ai is to be

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
able to

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
uh demonstrate and display some sort of

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,599
some form of

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:58,720
intelligence and um uh

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,800
actualization of data without us as

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,680
developers or data scientists having to

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
intervene

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,400
uh too much to get them to the right

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
answer

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,800
so watson is a question answer system

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,800
so we can give it data it will

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,919
try different algorithms and

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,080
hyper parameters and different ways of

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,720
optimizing to create the model it will

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
do all of that testing for you

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
so that essentially you can feed it data

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
and it will give you

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
a highly accurate response

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
so watson studio is going to be your one

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,560
stop shop for your ai

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
machine learning needs for your teams or

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,959
individually if you're working on

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,399
projects at home

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
and so we're going to get started

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,560
so let me just

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
change my view here

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
okay

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:23,839
all right just a moment

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,070
up let's see them

to uh my ibm

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,839
cloud account um this is a personal

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,480
account not

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:14,160
a work account so you will be able to um

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
see what uh

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,600
real expectation for you um will look

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
like

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,880
okay perfect

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
all right

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,440
so um oh okay

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,120
all right we're good um so if you don't

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
already have an ibm cloud account

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,440
please use the link the links that i

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,160
posted near the top um to set that up

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
um again you can also uh i will give you

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
access to the slides so you can do this

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,839
at home

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
um it does take some time to um

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
for the models and things to finish uh

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
generating

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,199
um but i i do want to show you so when

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
you create your um

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,560
your cloud account this is the dashboard

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,760
you will see

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:09,279
so what we're first going to do is

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,839
open up our watson studio so as you can

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,040
see

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,600
i already have watson studio instance

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,920
running

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,959
because i've already done this before

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
for those of you

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
uh you this is what you would see from

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,279
the catalog results

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,839
you can also search in the catalog here

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
so i'll select watson studio here

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,199
and you will need to create a new

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:41,839
uh instance of watson studio

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,839
and that's what this looks like here

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
so as you can see um you can only have

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,320
one instance

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
of watson studio in the light plan um if

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,480
you have an upgraded account

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,720
you can have more than one that's fine

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,320
um so i'm going to just go to my

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
instance of watson studio

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,839
that i have here

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:23,839
i'll open this up

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
so just while that's loading there for a

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,399
moment

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,440
um just so i can show you

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,440
um what you will see

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,759
oops if you don't already have an

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,759
account

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,240
here's the link you will be creating an

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,839
ibm cloud free lighter account

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,839
and this is what that will look like

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,839
when you go to sign in

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
so what i'm going to show you here is

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,920
this here's my watson studio i want to

00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
get started

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,240
so let's all pray that the uh demo gods

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
are in my favor today

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,679
is running a little slower than usual i

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,679
think i'm just

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:33,679
we have too much going on with the

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:36,160
internet right now

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,160
okay

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,039
i'm not really sure uh things are moving

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:47,840
very slowly

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,840
at the moment

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,400
so plan b

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,360
i have everything screenshotted so we

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
can go through it

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,080
perfect so this is what will you'll see

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,320
when you open up your

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,799
instance of watson studio and you're

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,360
going to click create a new project

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
so i'm going to call i i actually ran

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
through all of this earlier today just

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,880
to double check and make sure

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
all of my documentation was updated and

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,559
and

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
up to date um so uh we're going to

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,760
create a new uh

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,960
auto ai experiment uh from blink

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,679
and you can give it a name um for

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
for reference in this instance the data

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,960
set we were we are going to use

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,400
is um data set from uh the survivors of

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,520
the titanic

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,600
so you just call my experiment

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
um the name of the session predict the

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
future with watson studio

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,679
auto ai um and then you'll be brought

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
here

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,360
so what the first thing you're going to

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,520
need to do is add a data source

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,280
um the data source the titanic.csv

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,400
file you can find um in the

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,240
github repository which i also posted in

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,320
the chat

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,679
um so once you uh you'll need to

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,240
download that locally to your computer

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
and so what you can do here is um you

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,880
can

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
browse for that data

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,840
you'll need to select your asset

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,960
um and so we're i've i've already

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,160
uploaded this data set

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,559
into my um watson studio instance

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
my in my new experiment that i started

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,640
um

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,240
so what i can what i did here was i'm

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,440
selecting it um uh my data set

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,880
um from a from an from

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
a project so um here i'm adding my data

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
source

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,440
that i've already uploaded and what

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,799
we're looking at here we want to

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
configure this data

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,000
so that um we can optimize it

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
and there's a lot of ways to customize

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,200
which i will show you

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,600
for this experiment so

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,440
um for reference

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,520
you know some of you that are new that

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,240
are like what does this mean

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,039
what is this data look like like what

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,039
are these things

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
where do i find this stuff i do have

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,880
some links

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,400
in the um resource

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,960
resource section of my slides as well

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,280
to share with you as well so you can use

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,520
things like craggle and google scholar

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,520
um but this is what our data looks like

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,840
so we have um which class

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,440
people were in and these are um all the

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,640
people on the titanic so

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,280
um uh we have um

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,360
survived or not survived is just a

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,840
binary classification

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,280
so we have one for survive zero for not

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
survived we have their

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,799
uh which class ticket they bought their

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,480
name

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,120
their sex their age and then they looked

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,880
at

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,039
whether or not they had siblings or

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
spouses on board and how many

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,039
so this person had three this person

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,280
didn't have any this person had four

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,440
and then if they had parents or children

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,720
on board so this person had two this

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
person had five

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,039
and then what fare they paid so this is

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,000
an example of what

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,720
a good set of data looks like to feed

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
into

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,840
a model and again this is um

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
in the github repository for you to

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,919
download uh

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,919
with one click as well um

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,120
you go back here perfect

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,039
so the next step we're going to do um

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,440
what do we what do you want to predict

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
right so um this has been optimized as

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,200
well so it's easier for you to

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,799
use um so uh what we need to determine

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
here is what do we want to predict we

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,200
wanted to predict um

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,640
whether or not um they survived right so

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
um we are going to choose uh survived

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,960
uh it is an integer and it's a binary

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,000
classification

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,880
um and then uh what we can do next

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,960
is it's a little cut off here um there's

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,480
a

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,200
settings here for our data so

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,679
we can further configure our data sets

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
so

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
if you as you can see now uh we have

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,840
this by

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
uh prediction type binary classification

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,919
right

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,440
positive class is one that's all been um

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,760
entered in on its own um

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
automatically just in selecting what we

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,159
want to predict

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,159
uh the optimize metric is for accuracy

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,000
um

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,520
there we go so when we click

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
uh that the um bottom

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
left button uh we can come into our

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
experiment settings

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
so click on prediction uh we can take a

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,120
look our positive class here so

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,320
for instance if you um uh

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,640
needed to change this uh for any reason

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,320
um you can also change what which

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
algorithms you would like to test again

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,840
this is default um

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,159
yes okay um

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
so you can choose which algorithms you

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
would like to test however this has

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,080
already been optimized

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,400
for you it's already uh it has

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
a default optimized settings set for you

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
but you can go in here and change it and

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,799
customize it

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,440
get a lot more hands-on

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,520
with your experiment settings that you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,200
would like to run

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,360
what i'm going to choose here is this

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,120
roc a auc

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,840
so this is going to measure how well a

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,240
parameter can

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,120
distinguish between two groups um

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,679
and the reason why i'm doing this is auc

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,120
r

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,120
r o c is a binary classification

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,880
and it's one of the most important

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,440
evaluation metrics for checking

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,480
any classification model's performance

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
so

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,919
um i'm going to select this um

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
this is a simple uh uh

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,320
binary classification problem so we just

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,080
want we don't want to predict

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,600
how old someone is or how much money

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
they spent we're just predicting whether

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,159
or not they survive

00:24:51,120 --> 00:25:00,000
um so i'm going to choose the rs

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,760
optimize metric roc auc here

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,520
so i've done that in the experiment

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
settings and then i can select

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,480
run experiment

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,320
and essentially this is the view that

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,159
you're going to see so it will tell you

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,440
your auto ai

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,720
experiment run has started um based on

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
the size of the training set and

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,360
configuration this run could take some

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,520
time

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,520
um so essentially um

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,679
so auto ai is going to predict the

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,919
survivors of the titanic forest

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,159
so first we load the datasets from our

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:36,960
titanic.csv uh file

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
next we select the survive column like

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,720
we just did

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
depending on the type of variable we

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,159
want to predict uh

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:50,000
which as we already discussed we want to

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,080
uh select uh we want to predict

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,039
survival rate so we want to predict who

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,000
survived whether or not they survived

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,600
uh so it auto ai is then going to

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
automatically select the

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,080
the metrics metric to optimize we went

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,120
in and changed it to auc

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,799
roc um so in this case since it's a

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,600
binary classification problem we

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,400
selected that auc roc

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,840
uh behind the scenes the tool is going

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
to split the data

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,360
um into training and hold out sets for

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,520
you

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,440
now if you are someone that's in data

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,000
science this is something that you would

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,039
uh

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,559
regularly need to do yourself um

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,120
watson studio will uh

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,960
separate the data um into training and

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,679
holdout sets for you so you do not have

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
to do that

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,440
you can just upload the data that you

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,520
want to test

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,120
and generate a custom model from

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,400
so it then is going to apply three-fold

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,880
cross-validation

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,039
to evaluate the viability of numerous

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,320
estimators so as you can see

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,159
we um we looked at all the different

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,000
algorithms that we can test

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,400
we have all of them selected at the

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,360
moment um

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,640
so it's gonna evaluate the viability of

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,279
numerous estimators

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
in order to predict new and unseen data

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,600
so

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,039
essentially what we're going to do and

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,159
i'll show you once we get to the end

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
here

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,960
we're going to feed our model new data

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,080
and then it's going to give us a

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,880
prediction based on what it's learned

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:32,000
from evaluating the data that we fed it

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:35,279
and training it with watson studios

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,600
algorithms and different hyper

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,600
parameters selected for optimization

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,039
so next the tool is going to generate

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,440
pipelines

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,840
using hyperparameter tuning and feature

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
engineering for each estimator

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,880
so here you can see and and as this runs

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,520
it will show you

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,520
which part of the processes process it

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,840
is in so here it's selecting

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
uh algorithms for optimization

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
and now it's starting to generate our

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,840
pipelines so

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
uh

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,039
under normal circumstances uh for

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,399
instance if you're a data scientist and

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,520
you do this

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,000
manually this could take hours or weeks

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,600
but with auto ai we're able to train our

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,559
first two pipelines in a matter of

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,960
seconds

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,880
so the system continues to run until the

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,159
process is finished

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,320
and this could take anywhere from

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
three to five minutes up to 10 or 20

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,000
minutes depending on

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,200
how much data you're using and how your

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,720
computer is running

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:47,919
um and uh

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,919
let me move forward here

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,399
so here uh we can see uh hyper parameter

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,399
optimization

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:03,679
we can see our pipeline 3

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,600
is as it's running this pipeline is

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,720
optimizing for roc auc

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,720
you can also see the

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,120
enhancements um being tested for each

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
pipeline

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:27,600
now we're uh working through some

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:30,880
feature engineering here

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,000
and again this will be uh as you work

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,760
through this at home

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,039
i would say this probably takes about

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,039
three to five minutes this part

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,080
uh we have pipeline here and again we

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,200
selected roc

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,200
auc for uh optimization um

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,840
so when it's finished running we'll have

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,840
a total of eight pipelines

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
um

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,600
as you can see here

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,799
oh it's a little cut off so pipeline

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,840
three um

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,480
is our top ranked pipeline uh and we can

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,480
see here

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:17,919
we have xgb classifier enhancement

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,840
we have uh feature transformers we

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,240
have a univariate feature selection and

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,440
feature agglomeration we can also look

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,279
at the other

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
pipelines as well um

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,799
so if we look at um pipeline seven and

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,200
pipeline eight we have

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,360
uh feature transformers we have square

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,000
uh we also have principal component

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,000
analysis

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:52,000
and again we have four pipelines that um

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,600
use univariate feature selection

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,720
and then we have two pipelines that used

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,720
feature agglomeration

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,840
and then we have four pipelines here um

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
that use the xgb uh classifier

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,720
so and i just um put examples here some

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,799
more views but our our top

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
ranking pipeline was pipeline eight it

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,080
was ranked first

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,480
uh it was uh have optimized

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,600
with uh roc auc um we have hpo1

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,200
fe and hpo2 enhancements

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,320
um and we can select this pipeline and

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,559
learn more about it uh

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,279
so here's a metric chart showing all of

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,519
the different pipelines

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:44,480
model name accuracy so um pipeline eight

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,159
uh we can we can we're right now we're

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,200
looking at the cross validation

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:55,279
set so my pipeline 8

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:58,480
has an accuracy of 83.8.58

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,840
we can look at a lot of other

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,720
more in the weeds than um

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,080
a developer would need but would are is

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,320
really great information for a data

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,640
scientist

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,760
um so we're gonna select our our top

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,799
ranking pipeline

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,159
that has uh optimized for roc

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,279
the algorithm um here is the random

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,279
forest classifier

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:29,600
um so we're going to take a look

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,360
how about that oh i apologize uh we can

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,039
look at the holdout data as well that's

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,679
what i was trying to show here

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,559
so here we can look at the holdout data

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
so if we

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,440
in the holdout data the top ranking

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,200
pipeline was pipeline two

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,880
we can look at the metric chart for our

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,159
holdout data pipelines as well

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,039
and we can um uh

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,919
we're gonna look at our uh cross

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,559
validation

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,360
uh pipelines so pipeline 8 was our top

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,360
ranking pipeline

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,159
just go back here and make sure there's

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,320
no questions okay um i want to make sure

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,159
i get through all of this for you

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,440
i had a little technical trouble in the

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
beginning so

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,720
um within this pipeline we can look at

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,480
the model evaluation

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,480
we can view our confusion matrix

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,880
we can also look at the precision recall

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
curve

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,519
we can look at the model information

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,000
the model transformations and the

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,000
feature importance

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,559
so uh this this tells us the um

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,760
ranking in uh order of importance of the

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,039
different features that

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,840
um we tested for um

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,559
the data that we fed it so it looks like

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,600
such

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,200
was the most important feature

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,760
in predicting whether or not someone

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
survived

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,799
so going back to our model evaluation

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,240
or you can be in any view really within

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,960
our top ranking our

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,079
first ranked pipeline uh you can click

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,079
save as

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,720
and this is really great so we can save

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,639
this as a model which we can then deploy

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,280
we can also save this as a notebook

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,560
which we're going to do a session on

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,159
in the next few weeks um

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,079
covering jupiter notebooks and how we

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,240
can uh

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,599
take our our notebook from here but what

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,960
we're going to look at today is

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:39,440
is our our custom model and deploying it

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,560
so um a lot of the model names and

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,480
pieces that you're do so

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,919
i didn't have to change my name this was

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,839
the model name that it gave me

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,520
so i just kept it and saved it and then

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,879
once you save it here

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,119
it will tell you model saved

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,040
successfully

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,040
and then we can view it in the project

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,240
so we can access it just from clicking

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,000
here

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,040
we can also uh access it from our

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,440
um project overview

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,440
um

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,079
so uh here is our model

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,920
we can view the summary uh input schema

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,680
um uh there's some other we can view the

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,040
evaluation which we don't have any yet

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,640
we can also view the

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
lineage that we don't have any yet

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,800
either but the really great part about

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,640
here

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,520
is that we have an area for deployment

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,200
so right now our model is not deployed

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,079
but we can change that we can add a

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,079
deployment so

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,440
we can click add deployment i just gave

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,520
the

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,280
deployment the same name as my

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,680
experiment that i'm running for in my

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
project

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,839
and as you can see here it's already

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,839
selected for a web service

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,960
and then what you'll see is uh your

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
deployment initializing

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,280
and again this takes about three to five

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,280
minutes

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,079
um

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,359
once your deployment is ready

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,280
this is what you will see that it's

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,480
ready

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,920
and then what you can do is um you can

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,839
click on the name uh

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,520
or you can click view um

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:37,839
so here we're looking at uh

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,839
i'm we're clicking on our deployment and

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,359
getting more information for it so here

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,040
we can see our deployment and some

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,680
information about it when it was last

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,520
modified when it was created

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,760
we can also get some information about

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,240
the model down here which was a little

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
cut off

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,720
here also you can click view

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,839
so here's some of that model information

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,839
the name the id

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,280
and if you see the next tab over we have

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,160
implementation

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,760
so this part is really great so we can

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,800
see the scoring endpoint

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,240
point here um authorization you'll need

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,320
to create a bearer token

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,160
we have some watson machine learning

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,520
authentication authentication

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,839
documentation

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,960
uh really easy steps for creating your

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,359
barrel token

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,040
um and then this should find your

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,440
machine learning instance id

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,560
so essentially you'll need your endpoint

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,000
your bearer token

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,839
and your machine learning instance id

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,839
and then we have some um

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
we can all uh sorry we have some code

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,720
snippets here

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,480
in some different languages so um this

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,079
is really helpful this gives you all the

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,560
code that you need and then again you

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,599
just need to customize your bearer token

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,880
and your machine learning instance id so

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,960
we have

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,040
curl java javascript and python

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,200
we also have scala so here's what this

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,960
looks like and it shows you where you

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,880
need to put in your tokens

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,400
so here's our instance id that we'll

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,400
need to change that here

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,599
and then here's a really great part

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
normally when

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,839
um you build an api

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,839
uh you need to test it right and postman

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,560
is really amazing for doing amazing for

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,880
doing that

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,720
but in these are any even easier way of

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,480
doing that without needing

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,480
your machine learning instance id

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,680
without needing your bearer token is you

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,200
can test it

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:41,440
right within the test tab within your

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,520
model so i put my information in here

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
and i wasn't on the titanic obviously

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,560
however

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,839
if i were uh our custom model is going

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,040
to tell me whether or not i would have

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,000
survived

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,200
so i selected that i'd be in first class

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,400
wishful thinking

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,560
my name uh i'm female

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,720
my age whether or not i have siblings so

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,280
i'm saying i'm bringing one sibling or

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,040
spouse

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,839
i'm not bringing any kids and i'm paying

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,119
75 for my hair

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,280
so then i can click predict and what i

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,880
get back is the json response

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,119
so congratulations to me i survived

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
remember that binary classifier that we

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,119
were talking about at the beginning

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,480
zero one so i survived with the

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,119
nine 99.9 percent probability

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,960
uh some other really great things so for

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,720
instance we can provide the input using

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,760
this form

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,359
we can also provide input as a json

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,079
request so let's say i wanted to use

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,000
postman

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,560
i could do that and here's what that

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,680
data looks like

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:56,240
uh then send a request to my model

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,560
to get get my prediction response back

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,760
and this is what it looks like so

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,960
congratulations

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,440
you have just created your first uh

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,839
custom machine learning model with

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,160
watson studio auto ai

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,240
so you should all feel very proud uh

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,480
developers and data scientists alike

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,599
uh this is this is bringing us all in

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,319
the same playing field

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,280
where we can um really do a lot more

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,480
with our data much

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,480
more quickly

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,760
oops sorry about that okay

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
so this is uh these are the resources

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,440
that i

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,480
mentioned earlier um again i'm going to

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,280
post uh in the slot in the

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,920
i apologize in the chat um for all of

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
you as well

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,359
i'm going to repost all of the links

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,560
that i posted at the beginning

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,640
you can also um view them here i'm sure

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,839
there will be a way to

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,119
send some sort of follow-up or something

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,200
of some kind

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,440
um but i'm going to uh

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,319
post everything in the chat again so

that you can all

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,440
have access to them

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:14,160
so here's one

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:18,160
here is so here's the workshop slides

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,160
here's the link for creating um

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,839
a cloud account

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:29,040
here is the link to the

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,040
github repository

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,839
and then oops

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,119

please feel free uh to

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,000
join our ibm developer austin channel we

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,680
have a lot of great

00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,359
um uh ibm developer advocates as well as

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,760
um uh federated advocate ibm's so these

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,000
are

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,960
data scientists developers other people

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,280
within ibm

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,000
that want to share products they're

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,359
working on

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,440
do workshops on things they're
