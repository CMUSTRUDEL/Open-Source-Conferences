	Predict the Future with Watson Studio AutoAI

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Jenna Ritten, IBM

Abstract: Learn how to build and deploy your very own AI predictive models from IBM Developer Advocate Jenna Ritten. IBM Watson Studio AutoAI automatically analyzes your data and generates customized predictive model pipelines. It categorizes data as needed, does features engineering and optimizes hyperparameters to get to the best possible model. We will show you how to integrate Watson Studio AutoAI into your projects.

Using AutoAI, you can build and deploy a machine learning model with sophisticated training features and no coding. The tool does most of the work for you. We will walk you through how to deploy your customs models to your application.

The AutoAI process follows this sequence to build candidate pipelines:

- Data Pre-Processing
- Automated Model Selection
- Automated Feature Engineering
- Hyperparameter Optimization
