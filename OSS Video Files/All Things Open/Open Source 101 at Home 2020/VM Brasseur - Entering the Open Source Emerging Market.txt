Description: 
	Entering the Open Source Emerging Market

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: VM Brasseur, Juniper Networks

Abstract: Free and open source software is an emerging market for most of the corporate and business world. It's a new land, abundant in resources and promise, and businesses are getting very excited about the possibilities. With such potential, a growing number of businesses are looking to enter the FOSS emerging market, which is no surprise.

It's also an entirely foreign culture, and many businesses are struggling to learn how to operate in this new land. This talk focuses on best practices for businesses entering this brave new world, including:

- Defining "emerging market"
- Why companies fail when entering emerging markets of any kind
- A framework for companies looking to participate in FOSS

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,000
so thank you all if you're not here to

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,220
see successfully entering the Foss

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,050
emerging market then I strongly

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,789
recommend you bounce on over to Deb

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,859
Nicholson's talk because she is

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,680
brilliant and you don't want to miss her

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,199
stuff either live or on video because

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,429
apparently this is all being recorded

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
which is great it's the first time the

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,070
all things open team have been able to

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,149
do that so I'm really grateful for them

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,460
to you to get that opportunity so um

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,340
these slides are already available right

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,010
now here's the URL for that I will also

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,719
show you this URL at the end and as you

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,399
can see here it's also in the footer of

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,550
a lot of the slides the ones that don't

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,070
have images on them will have a link to

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,280
this slide so you can go see those now I

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,899
also have a couple of practice videos up

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,190
so you can see how the sausage gets made

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:07,680
and um with that I will start the actual

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:10,710
content Western history is full of tales

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,750
of exploration we have Herodotus here

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,810
who while ostensibly was writing

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,080
histories of the Persian Wars here's the

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,580
world's first documented historian um so

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,229
while reading histories of the Persian

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,150
War the most interesting parts of his

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,250
writings are those about the new lands

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,250
and the new people that he meets along

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,619
the way Tacitus here in the middle was

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,869
covering Roman politics but he also

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,200
detailed the lives of exploration they

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,950
the people they discovered in far flung

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
and exotic places like Britain and while

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,770
they're very ancient historians slightly

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
less so is Marco Polo who after he

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,759
published his memoirs of his travels

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,649
throughout the Far East just inflamed

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,950
the world with a passion for Asian

00:01:52,649 --> 00:02:00,210
culture did wonderful things for the

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,920
perception of Asia within Europe but

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,710
it's not just a Western thing

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,340
exploration is a human thing we have

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,679
kupe who is a legendary Maori leader who

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,670
left Polynesia and discovered New

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,340
Zealand in a

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,630
new and the open waters of the Pacific

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,540
just amazing levels of hero of bravery

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,590
to do that we have here in the center

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,599
hyecho - was a Korean monk who left

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,390
Korea and was the first Korean to

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,220
explore India his motivation for doing

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,050
so was to become more familiar with the

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,870
homeland of the Buddha but he brought

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,000
home a lot of information about India to

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,330
the people in Korea and really opened a

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,150
lot of doors there and then we have Abu

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,560
Bakri who about whom there isn't nearly

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,850
enough information because there really

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,390
ought to be a movie about this man's

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,060
life

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,940
he was a fourteenth century ruler in

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,420
Mallya and he formed this massive Empire

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,580
so he's an emperor but he just that

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,920
wasn't what he wanted to do he wanted to

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,170
continue exploring so he handed his

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,540
throne over to a relative and then he

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,150
explored the Atlantic and he's said to

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,269
have landed in Brazil and be the first

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:16,109
person not from that continent to have

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:19,160
actually documented being in Brazil so

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:22,890
just amazing feats of exploration

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:27,329
however as we know we've what we've all

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,810
kind of been driven by this need and to

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,700
seek the unknown exploration

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,040
unfortunately isn't for altruistic

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,140
purposes most of the time optimistic

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,180
conquer it's the subjugate and more

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,780
unfortunate than that is that we are

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,030
still living today with the ripple

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,859
effects of that subjugation and the

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,950
bigotry that has come from some of these

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,530
explorations thankfully though we have

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,950
evolved because now exploration is

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,170
enterprise-grade we have given up mostly

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,150
the ships and canoes and camels which

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,150
used to take us to these exotic lands

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,049
and now we go for more things like

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,579
markets right so like most of the

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,519
explorers before us we're still very

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,069
interested less though in learning about

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,229
new people and but still very interested

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,650
in trading routes and new opportunities

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:22,409
to buy and especially sell products this

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,599
is where we get the emerging market um a

00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,950
lot of you are probably familiar with

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,810
determine of her

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,820
but you might not be as business-focused

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,590
as others on very business focused

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,220
despite being a free and open-source

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,050
software

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,720
advocate I do it on the indie business

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,970
space so um well I'm very familiar with

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,580
the emerging market most of you might

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,160
not be so I will be defining it so we

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,260
can all kind of be on the same page as

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,230
far as what it is in the context of this

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,550
specific talk and when you talk about

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,520
defining things the first place you

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,980
always go is Wikipedia there is a lot of

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,850
literature out there about the subject

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,680
of emerging markets but none of it none

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,990
none of it at all agrees on a single

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,270
definition so I'm just gonna start with

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,760
Wikipedia and in a few slides I will

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,610
evolve this definition now I will read

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,880
this definition out for people who are

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,250
vision impaired an emerging market is a

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,650
country that has some characteristics of

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,470
developed market but does not meet the

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,480
standards to be a developed market now I

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,250
have some problems with this definition

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,730
not least of which is that it's really

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,430
very limiting a very kind of tunnel

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,740
vision on country a market does not

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,360
equal a country if you know anything

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,770
about business you probably that was the

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,600
first thing you cop down to is that

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,770
market it's not a country a country can

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
be a market but a market is not a

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,630
country it's kind of like that square

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,300
rectangle thing um so a market it varies

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,210
by product by service offered and by the

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,420
receptiveness - and awareness of that

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,270
product or service so let's take for

00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,670
example avocado toast I love avocado

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,530
toast it's been popular in Australia for

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,480
years and years and years but recently

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,900
we've been seeing it a lot in the United

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,670
States

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,020
that's a good reason it's delicious I

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,480
love it um but is in this case for

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,940
avocado toast as it is entering the

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,370
United States is its emerging market the

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,100
entire United States of America well no

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,960
I mean maybe writ large it could be seen

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,540
that way but that's really not a useful

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,090
way to look at it um it's really far too

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,100
broad we've got the hipster coastal

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,310
urban areas like Portland Oregon where I

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,190
live and then the hipster inland urban

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,080
areas for instance like Omaha Nebraska

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,190
great city you should visit it and then

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,680
you have the

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,780
quite so hipster urban areas or the not

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,340
quite so urban are they fully rural

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,440
right there's just lots and lots of

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,660
different options here each town each

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,330
neighborhood each cafe which starts to

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,460
serve avocado toast is also serving

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,860
eight different market it's not simply

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,050
the market of the United States and as

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,510
avocado toast becomes more popular and

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,290
reaches saturation of awareness it not

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,750
only it becomes you know more available

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,330
but the markets its in stop being

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,160
emerging markets and they start to be

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:16,680
normal product markets for avocado toast

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,450
so with this in mind what exactly is an

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,160
emerging market or more specifically

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,830
what is the definition I'm going to be

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,090
using today now I did take that

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:31,320
Wikipedia of definition and I evolved it

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:34,140
a bit to again I will read for the

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,110
vision-impaired an emerging market is

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,750
one unfamiliar to or with a product

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,330
service enterprise or industry but has

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,510
the potential to become developed four

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:49,440
or by that product service enterprise or

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,390
industry and yes it still could use some

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,419
work maybe I'll workshop this one later

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,640
but it's technically accurate which as

00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,820
we all know is the very best sort of

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,050
accurate it's also a very good start and

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,460
it's going to work for the remainder of

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,080
this presentation so this is the

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,900
definition of emerging market I'm going

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,270
to be using going forward so now that

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,660
we're all in the same page it's story

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,000
time companies have been trying to enter

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,620
emerging markets for a long time I have

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,180
some examples of how it did not go

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:25,680
smoothly we have three examples here we

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,810
have coca-cola Coors and Electrolux so

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,400
called the cola looked at China when

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,020
trying to finally opened its borders and

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,580
said wow there's a whole lot of people

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,740
there and I bet they would love the

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,300
refreshing taste of coca-cola so we're

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,909
going to go to China and we're going to

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,180
sell our stuff so they did that and they

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,550
took the words coca-cola and they very

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,890
literally transliterated them into

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,430
Chinese characters I don't know which

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,540
dialect but Chinese characters now they

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,009
did this and today

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,649
they looked at and they said it means

00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:58,290
coca-cola but the people in China when

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,839
they saw these characters said well that

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,110
doesn't say coca-cola that says bite the

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,329
wax tadpole this because of course they

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,550
didn't exactly do any research they just

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,899
assumed that this is how the Chinese

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,940
language worked and so we're just going

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,889
to make coca-cola you know look like

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,690
this and they it did not go very well as

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,759
you can probably imagine it's funny to

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,069
us now but it was not funny to them at

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,209
the time which is the case with all of

00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,610
these stories I'm telling you it's

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,370
hilarious to us now but at the time it

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,670
was pretty bad for these companies such

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,259
as Coors now Coors is a beer in the

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,940
United States those of you who aren't in

00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,399
the US might not be familiar with course

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,430
but Coors is a a pretty venerable beer

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,889
brand in the US and they were looking

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,959
around us we've kind of concurred that

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,449
we've reached all the markets we want

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,269
there let's look outside of the US they

00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,550
looked at Spain which you know hot Sun

00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,680
beautiful weather great time to just

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,069
kick back with a cold refreshing Coors

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,889
right so they went to Spain and the

00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:01,529
slogan they chose to enter Spain in the

00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,829
Spanish area they were going they used

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:07,050
the Spanish phrase turn it loose Coors

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,790
turn it loose which you know they

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,470
thought it was really great on what they

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,720
did not know because they didn't bother

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,300
to do their research is that this big

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,110
marketing campaign was using the local

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:23,069
euphemism for diarrhea turn it loose met

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,540
diarrhea so Coors diarrhea um again went

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,970
about as well as you expected they had

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,190
to rethink that entire concept shall we

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,010
say and relaunch and try things all over

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,410
again and finally we have a country a

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,389
company not in the US trying to get into

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,360
the United States market and that's

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,310
Electrolux you may not know I did not

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,380
until I was doing my research years ago

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:47,069
I into emerging markets but Electrolux

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:49,319
is um it's a Swedish company today you

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,060
learn so it's a Swedish company and it

00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:53,550
was entering the United States market

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,009
which great market for them and they

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:00,209
were doing it with a slogan nothing

00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:03,750
sucks like an Electrolux which ok true

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:04,480
definitely yes does exactly what it says

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,329
on the tin

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,670
vacuum cleaners sucks which is not

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,579
really something that you want to say in

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,350
the US because succs means different

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,990
things than you think so

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,089
yeah these are situations where they

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,399
were pretty amusing to us but these

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,519
entries into emerging markets for them

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,139
completely flopped and things went very

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,339
very badly and they spent millions of

00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:32,529
millions of dollars on this sort of

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:34,600
stuff so that's that's unfortunate so

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,250
those are really dramatic hilarious

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,959
examples but most of the failures

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,589
entering the emerging markets are very

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,839
quiet but they still fail what happens

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,600
most often is that companies invest a

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,779
lot of money into launching their

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,550
products in these markets but they don't

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,870
see any return on that investment they

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,980
get maybe single-digit percentage on

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,260
revenue that's coming in from those

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,880
investments or they get none at all or

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,810
what happens more often as they spend

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,269
all the money and they don't get

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:08,350
anything back which is negative frankly

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:10,269
so um eventually they'll notice this and

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,100
then rather than seeing what's wrong

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,720
they'll just pull out of the market

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,410
completely leave it to their competitors

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,819
so they will pave the way you know Bend

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,010
those initial explorers into that

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,180
emerging market and then walk away their

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,579
competitors kind of pick up where

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,050
they're left up and do much better with

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:28,209
launching their emerging market because

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,089
they bother to learn whereas the company

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,940
that failed did not so and this happens

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,889
over and over again and why why do we

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,990
keep making the same mistakes well we're

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,490
humans we do that and one of the things

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,209
I do on this side is I like to study

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,639
failure so a lot of the failures I see

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,139
in this particular talk are just human

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,720
things that happen over and over again

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,959
that we don't bother to address and one

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,639
is we're arrogant we are so arrogant in

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,040
companies in particular are arrogant

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,149
they look at any merging market and

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,399
they're like well there's some business

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,399
I know business I'm going to go in there

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,899
and do some business to it um so they

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,720
walk into an emerging market with

00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:10,480
business as usual attitudes but an

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,550
emerging market I'll get into this a

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
little bit more later but an emerging

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,889
market businesses

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,110
anything but usual it does not work by

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,449
the same rules you are used to as a

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,480
company your usual go-to-market approach

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:26,100
doesn't work your usual messaging will

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,259
not resonate unless you're trying to

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,139
tell people to literally bite a wax head

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,399
bowl so the language you use isn't even

00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,709
the same one that will be understood in

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,889
the same way by the market that you're

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:41,040
looking to enter business is not usual

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:43,350
in an emerging market and they go in

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,540
there with these attitudes because they

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,149
don't do the research required again

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,250
with the arrogance right they think we

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,769
know what's going on we don't have to

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,870
learn more about this and so they don't

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,569
do the research into the new market or

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,550
its culture or its communication norms

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,279
or its language or pretty much anything

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,889
else having to do with that market and

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,579
this isn't only arrogant it's also

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:11,879
incredibly disrespectful to that market

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,730
that you're entering this leads to a lot

00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,069
of unrealistic expectations if you have

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,110
your business as usual image in your

00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,420
head and you haven't done any research

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,519
to dislodge that you're going to be

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,850
working under one set of expectations

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,889
where the emerging market actually has a

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,350
different one in reality different

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:33,300
expectations so companies will go into

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,550
an emerging market thinking they can

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,259
mold it through force of numbers be it

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,360
human or financial if we just throw

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,420
enough product out there we just

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,149
participate a lot then we can make a

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,160
difference but if the market isn't

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,990
receptive to that and it doesn't have

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,000
the same expectations of interaction as

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:57,120
the company that will still fail in

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,620
trying to root a an emerging market is a

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
relationship you're starting a

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,610
relationship here and like any

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,790
relationship between two people or a lot

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,259
of people takes time to do it properly

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,870
and takes time to make it last in it

00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:12,540
especially takes time to build and earn

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,610
trust and that's how you become more

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,579
successful by building and earning the

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,100
trust of those in the relationship it

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:22,860
also means that it is a relationship and

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,079
it's not just one person with my way or

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,610
the highway one company with my way or

00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,950
the highway there are multiple

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,140
perspectives there

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:33,850
have to consider those if you want your

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,980
entry into a market to be successful

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,920
from all of these criteria above the

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,870
weight companies are entering free and

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,700
open-source software is a lot like

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,920
entering an emerging market they are

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:52,880
making a lot of the exact same mistakes

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:55,070
and these things are fixable so for one

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,630
thing they are entering this emerging

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,850
market because it's trendy it's cool

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,040
ohmygosh open source it's really awesome

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,540
I mean they're all these big companies

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,750
that are getting involved now you got

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,450
Amazon Facebook Netflix and Google and

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,800
Microsoft and hello Microsoft welcome to

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,900
the free and open source software world

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,850
I'm so glad I'm legitimately glad you've

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,480
joined us that's one of the miracles of

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,010
this decade is Microsoft legitimately

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,750
joining open-source but look they're a

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,310
great big company if a big company is

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,860
doing it I should be doing it too right

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,240
it's trendy so lots of companies are

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,650
starting to get into free and open

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,600
source software and it's very buzz

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:35,090
worthy right now um it's also unfamiliar

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,920
though it is a foreign world for a lot

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,750
of these companies not only are these

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,060
people just giving stuff away for free

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,010
but they're doing so the goodness of

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,620
their own hearts or you know there's

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,650
there's lots of reasons why companies

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,510
aren't familiar with with free and

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,850
open-source software and how it operates

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,280
a lot of it is thanks to decades of

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,630
propaganda by other businesses which

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,000
thought that free and open-source was a

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,100
competitor but we also have to lay a

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,720
fair bit of blame at the feet of free

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,730
and open source software itself for

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
doing a dreadful job of marketing and

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,440
reaching out to companies and so there's

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,630
there's plenty of blame on both sides

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,190
that's okay it's all fixable we can we

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,079
can learn from the past and and move

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,520
forward but at the moment we do have

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,209
companies that are not as familiar with

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,699
free and open-source software and just

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,860
like emerging markets a lot of companies

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:27,230
fail when they enter this particular

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,240
market when they step into this foreign

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,740
land a free and open source software now

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,480
I am currently director of open source

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,850
strategy at juniper Networks but prior

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,670
to this I was a freelancer helping lots

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,220
of companies do better at free and open

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,060
source software and release contribute

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,680
and

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,110
participate in free and open-source

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,610
software projects in a way that's good

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,350
for their bottom line

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,470
just strategically good for their bottom

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,350
line but also for the communities that

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,360
they're participating in um and what I

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,250
saw over and over again so that

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,440
companies just didn't know what they

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,140
were doing they would just fail but they

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,550
would keep trying because there were

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,930
really good reasons for them to be

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,650
participating in free and open-source

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,140
software projects for starters just

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,200
using free and open-source is this huge

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,700
rocket boost for your company it doesn't

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,250
matter whether you're a software company

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,770
or just a soft a company that uses and

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,720
develop software using free and open

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,320
source software for that same massive

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,540
step up it gives you a boost above your

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,730
competition who might not be using free

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,850
and open source solutions right and if

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,230
you're looking to develop and innovate

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,180
doing that where you don't have to build

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,040
fundamental pieces of the building block

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,040
but you don't have to build for instance

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,490
your own database my gosh you just saved

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,290
so many hours and so much time and so

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,420
your company is able to innovate on the

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,010
other things that actually do matter so

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,440
that's a great reason for companies to

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:57,440
be participating in and using free and

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,570
open source software but as they are

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,360
doing this defining that there's a much

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,090
lower cost of ownership for that

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,660
software because that cost is shared

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:11,240
it's a Commons everyone is using and

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,610
contributing to that database everyone

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,740
is helping to build it so you don't have

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,990
to do it yourself your cost of ownership

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,360
you can own this thing without have to

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,820
pay for all of its care and feeding and

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,620
that really helps a lot of the bottom

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,250
line of companies in it it makes a

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,570
dramatic difference to businesses but

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,950
one thing that a lot of companies don't

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,440
talk about and probably should a lot

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,150
more is the recruiting involved in this

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,340
and not simply bringing in new people

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,170
but also getting them up to speed the

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,030
onboarding process after our reward

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,770
which is also part of recruiting as far

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,200
as I'm concerned that's just part of the

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,810
whole hiring process so as you are

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,090
recruiting if you're participating in

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,610
open source projects as an authentic

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,450
community member of your company when

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,750
you have openings you can go

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,750
to your community and say hi we need an

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:03,200
InfoSec engineer and a senior front-end

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,580
dev who in the community is interested

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,310
not only are you going to get people

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,010
whom you know are good because you've

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,840
seen their work you know are not jerks

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,450
because you've seen them participate in

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,940
the community but when they come on

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,740
board and you hire them they know your

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,480
stack and they're able to get up to

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,830
speed so much more quickly they knock

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,600
your staff because they bloody well

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:30,600
built it so there's a lot of great like

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,850
benefit and MCS you found in a company

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,920
being CENTAC member of freight opens to

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,770
software communities this is why they

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,710
keep doing it unfortunately they do keep

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,680
doing it wrong because they do steam in

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,060
their business as usual

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,760
the free and open source software

00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,530
business as usual does not work even if

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,570
you are a software company and you think

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,910
you know how software development works

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,650
we does software we can do this just

00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,040
steam into an open source project and

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,910
start doing what you're used to that

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,130
ain't gonna fly

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,340
it's you're gonna fall flat on your face

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:08,460
and probably offended the community that

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,770
you probably rely on that's because open

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,320
source projects aren't really they're

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,980
not business they right at the edges of

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,640
business and now I'm gonna get literate

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,590
on you um emerging markets free and open

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,810
source and otherwise are liminal zones

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,880
and in literature a liminal zone is a

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,700
place of transition it's literally a

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,310
Lehman a Lehman is a threshold of a door

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,040
it's that spot in between outside and

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,230
insights neither here nor there it's

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,270
where the water reaches the shore right

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,270
where they touch that's a liminal zone

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:46,230
it's neither water nor land it's this

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:49,200
really magical place in an inner turret

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,510
and in mythology in particular this is

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,880
where the magic happened transformations

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,900
happen at liminal zones because the

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,880
normal rules do not apply here

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,530
heroes are created and destroyed in the

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,780
liminal zone

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,930
Fatah's for instance here dipping her

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,100
son achilles into the river styxx to

00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,700
make him

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,919
much invulnerable had one little thing

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,110
that that broke him down but pretty much

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,690
embalmer bullying she was in the liminal

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,350
zone when she did this so your real

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:24,600
world real world rules don't apply in a

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,220
liminal zone there are new rules and if

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,940
you don't take the time to learn them

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,530
then you will suffer the consequences

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,510
but the good news is that while your

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,669
usual approaches to software development

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,100
probably won't work the way you expect

00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:40,860
them to you're also free to think out of

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,150
the box and try new approaches a lot of

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,159
companies aren't comfortable with this

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,600
um but it's unfortunate and those are

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
also the companies that aren't really

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,500
able to innovate and probably aren't

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,510
going to be going anywhere but the

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,870
companies that do become comfortable

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:58,740
with this are no longer held back by the

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,720
their usual constraints and because they

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,020
no longer have the usual constraints

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,990
they can start the unusual bits that I

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:13,470
mentioned earlier so they do have to

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,570
format with these or to do this all

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,590
hosts healthy relationships there is

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,059
more than one perspective as companies

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,340
participate in free and open source

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,900
software they got to get something out

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,530
of this as well it can't simply be a

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,120
one-sided relationship so look at the

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,580
projects that your company would be

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,770
participating in and do things like pay

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,549
people to build new features that are

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,549
strategically

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,610
pay for their cloud-computing bill's

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,350
sponsor wonderful things like open

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,600
source 101 we have some beautiful

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,760
sponsors here I do you could check them

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,280
out in the expo hall if that's real

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,310
important to communities like be able to

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,050
get benefit that your company can give

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,840
them is sponsoring and making events

00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,360
like this a reality and also the

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,890
communities can get absolutely wonderful

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,380
technical contributions that they might

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,570
not get otherwise if my company needs a

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,300
feature that we develop internally we

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,700
can release it to the community who can

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,850
get wonderful new things new security

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,160
new user interface new documentation

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,800
that they wouldn't get otherwise so

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,070
there when done properly this is a good

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:27,630
relationship and both sides get ample

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:30,100
benefits which actually brings us to a

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,950
very important question which is how do

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,260
you do this properly as a company how do

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,670
you get into the emerging market of free

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,770
and open source software there are right

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,990
and wrong ways to do it and you don't

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:44,500
want to be the company that goes biting

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,220
the wax tadpole so how do you do this

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,100
well anyway

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,700
and really respect and consideration do

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,370
an unfamiliar culture and at a company

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,170
low I guarantee this is an unfamiliar

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,060
culture I don't care if you have that

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,070
one person who has been a core

00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,920
contributor on this one free and open

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,440
source project for 15 years that's one

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,080
person your company is much larger than

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,550
that so don't think that you know how to

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,790
do free and open source software because

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:18,520
you employ one developer somewhere who

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,160
has been doing this before this is a

00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,420
cultural issue that your company has to

00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:27,520
grok how does it do this well you have

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,770
to look at the markets that you're going

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,720
to enter as with any emerging market

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,840
look at the market before you enter

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,360
right pause reflect research and listen

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,030
they are for very small words but

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,430
they're heavy there's a lot hiding

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:44,200
behind them particularly pausing and

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,330
reflecting which are two things like

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,270
human beings seem to be incredibly bad

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,280
at so don't just dive into these

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,840
emerging markets following you

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,630
you'll playbook take some time to

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,340
prepare before getting started with your

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,460
company's participation and great open

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,460
source software starting with finding

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,530
out why you're there in the first place

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,560
this is one of the biggest causes of

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,940
failure across all human endeavors it's

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,390
not knowing why you're doing it to begin

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,800
with

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:16,060
just doing it default to action so what

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,200
does your company hope to get out of

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,240
this you are going to invest a lot of

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,610
time a lot of talent and a lot of

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,320
treasure into participating in free and

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,680
open-source software but what are you

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,680
going to get out of it you have you know

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,930
duty in your company to do business you

00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,090
can't you're not a non-profit you're not

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,920
a charity you have to get something out

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,320
of the investments that your company is

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,620
making so what do you hope to get out of

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,670
it

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,680
and if you don't know why you're doing

00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,590
this then you're just following a trend

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,650
and trends are not strategic and trends

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,840
do not return on your investment so do

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,610
make sure you figure out what your goals

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,590
are strategically as a company and once

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,480
you do figure out what those goals are

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,010
they don't have to be lofty they don't

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,800
have to be huge they don't have to be

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,510
you know something that's gonna end up

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,120
getting you written up in some beautiful

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,650
Harvard Business Review thing it doesn't

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,510
have to be that way it just has to be

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,850
some concrete thing you want to get out

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,880
of this participation but what does

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:22,480
success look like because if you can't

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,810
identify success then you also can't

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,810
identify failure because they kind of

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,910
look the same if you're looking at them

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,810
one or the other when you put them next

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:37,480
to each other they are opposites but if

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,610
you only have failure without success

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,440
you can't compare them so do define what

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:46,660
success looks like because otherwise

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,160
you're likely to fail and then only then

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,480
once you have your goals then you can

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,400
start to figure out what actions can

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,660
take you there can we have a default

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,000
towards action it's one of those things

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,650
that human beings do we don't go don't

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,840
come up with goals we don't define what

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:01,030
success looks like and we have a default

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,830
action that can be quite admirable

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,960
someone's falling in a well

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,019
drowning you default to action take

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,519
action right there but as a company you

00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,630
probably want to thank some things

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,820
through a little more

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,120
so what actions are going to meet you

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,919
towards you get you towards your goal is

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,960
it open sourcing something internal is

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,700
that what makes sense for your company

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,269
and its goals I don't know I don't know

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,130
your company

00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:25,840
I don't know its goals I don't know it's

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,059
projects so I don't know whether that

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,590
makes sense but it might be that that's

00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,070
what makes sense for you to release

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:35,049
software or it might make more sense

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,220
purely for you to contribute and this is

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:38,799
something frankly it makes sense for

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,260
every project to do or every company to

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,970
do because you your company is probably

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,080
built on software and your software is

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,799
built on open source

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,630
I guarantee and the open source is part

00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,659
of your software supply chain and their

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,510
links in that chain and there are links

00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:57,730
that might be weak what happens when

00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,740
that chain snaps when that link gives

00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,539
away tablets your company what happens

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,120
to your product but happens to your your

00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:07,299
users well that's a mission-critical

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,090
project that you could be participating

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,399
in and forging stronger links in your

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,350
software supply chain and if you're not

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,559
doing that then you're putting your

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,059
company at great risk as well as the

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,279
project that you are not supporting

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:25,450
they're also likely to disappear if

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,639
you're not helping it might make sense

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,919
for you not to do that stuff and instead

00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:32,019
it might make more sense for you to

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,500
probably throw money at the problem and

00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:38,470
join a foundation it might make sense

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,960
for you to join a foundation at a board

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,090
level and start to help to direct the

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,730
governance book project that can

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,620
sometimes give you more say into what

00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,840
features are developed or maybe the

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,490
budgets of the project that might make

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,950
more sense for your company I don't know

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,919
you can mix and match all these I don't

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,380
know it but you do because you take the

00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,179
time to figure out your goals but you

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,980
can't figure out what actions make the

00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:06,190
most sense if you don't have those goals

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,230
you know you're trying to shoot a target

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,560
in a dark room when you can't see that

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,930
there's not a target at the

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,490
their end so you absolutely need to have

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,700
your goals before you do anything it

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,560
helps once you have those goals you have

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,180
your actions you can start to come up

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,310
with some sort of metrics and metrics is

00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,010
kind of loosey-goosey term here it's

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:27,290
just how can you tell things are working

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,360
right it could be a billion sort of

00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,600
thing now that can count as metric in

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,400
the case but are things working and they

00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,170
have to be actionable and they have to

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,880
be tied to goals because metrics that

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,980
aren't tied to goals are just vanity

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,950
metrics they're usually the ones that

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,780
are really really easy to gather and

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,680
therefore easy to put on a slide when

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,070
you're talking to your board of

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,450
directors but they're not useful and by

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,220
useful I mean they can't tell you

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,500
whether you're on track to meet your

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,390
goals so you can check in on the metrics

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,010
more often and see whether they're

00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,690
starting to go off and if they're

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,850
starting to go off you can pull them

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,230
back but if you don't see these metrics

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,490
you don't have them and you're not

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,220
checking them you'll never know whether

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,690
you're not going to meet your goals so

00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,300
if you don't have goals if you don't

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,010
have metrics that are tied to actions

00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,680
and your goals then you probably also

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:19,790
don't have any hope of success sorry I

00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,250
don't make the rules um and once you

00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:24,800
have these things I'm assuming although

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,670
I should not assume that you also know

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,320
what projects you're going to

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,840
participate in I have a whole different

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,370
talk about that but um let's assume you

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,200
do and these are emerging markets for

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,700
your company that you're going to enter

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,540
these emerging markets before you do

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,120
that do some research you know who are

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,310
the coop key players in that project how

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,900
do they does the product prefer to

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,180
communicate what's our jargon how they

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,000
handle contributions do they have a

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,350
history of past companies trying to

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,240
participate with them I've seen this

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,340
happen where things went very badly in

00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,650
the past and the projects are now a

00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,840
little standoffish of other companies

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,060
participating you know that's usually

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,520
something they're a little they can be

00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:09,470
open about if you're bothering to listen

00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:11,180
so knowing that can help you as you're

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,470
entering this market you can do it a

00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,850
little more gently a little more

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,980
empathetically although you should be

00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,430
gentle and empathetic in any way but

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,160
knowing that can help you avoid

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,770
countless missteps but also can help you

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,560
avoid

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,610
missteps is getting just one person who

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:31,830
speaks the language one native speaker

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,890
one person who knows the culture really

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,570
really well because that one person can

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,390
look at the goals can look at the

00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,940
actions and just say hey you know that's

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,190
not going to work the way you're doing

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,920
this is going to be antithetical to how

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,750
this open-source project works or you're

00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,940
going to offend them or you're going to

00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,150
steamroll them or whatever that one

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,240
person can raise the red flag and keep

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,220
your company from screwing up you should

00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,130
give them the support necessary so they

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,140
feel free to do that because having just

00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,640
one person do that can be rather large

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,770
burden so you do have to support them

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,630
appropriately but that one person can

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,390
also work wonders for the success of

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,770
your company and it's emerging market

00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,270
free open-source software

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:20,190
efforts and then you do have to get over

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,470
you buy a season the best way to do that

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,480
is to start by admitting we have them

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,760
thanks to you again a couple of decades

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,570
of smear campaigns by large corporations

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,550
a lot of businesses have have

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,050
misinformation right and related fear

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,580
about free and open source software and

00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,070
your company needs to overcome that if

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,050
it's going to be successful

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:43,080
leave your biases at that liminal zone

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,450
at the door what sort of things might

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,960
you need to unlearn well first of all

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:52,200
stop being afraid of licenses licenses

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,970
are good the underpinning of all of free

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,790
and open source software is copyright

00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,460
and licenses or how you share your

00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,800
copyright um so licenses are amazing

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,170
they're wonderful to learn the basics

00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,810
jim jag had a talk earlier today that

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,070
you can check the recording out and it

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,740
was the basics of open source wipes

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,050
licensing right now Deb Nicholson has

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,230
another talk right this very moment also

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,550
about open source licensing um but the

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,960
biggest problem I find with companies in

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,669
open source licensing is they don't

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,800
bother to figure out what that open

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:24,780
source supply chain is so they don't

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,909
even know what links they have in their

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,919
chain let alone what the licenses are if

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,380
you don't know your license then you

00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,640
can't be in compliance with it so you

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,580
know just figure out what those links

00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,380
are track what you're using the version

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,930
the licenses and then make sure you're

00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,790
in compliance and yes that's

00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,990
oversimplification and hand-waving

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,630
license compliance can be a very

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:48,650
complicated thing but it's not as

00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:51,390
complicated as not doing it at all so

00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,610
stopping afraid of licenses stop being

00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:56,160
afraid of copyleft stop being afraid of

00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:59,280
bla bla bla and just pay attention

00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,750
because attention and intention is

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,410
really all that's needed to do this

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:07,700
properly there are a lot of people who

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,990
have a spread thud I should have

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,940
unpacked backronym but is fear

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,430
uncertainty and doubt

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,320
so spread fun about free and open source

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,810
software being less secure than

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,610
proprietary solutions and those are

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,650
people who are just trying to sell you

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,050
their proprietary solutions frankly

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,610
because while there are bugs hidden in

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,590
free and open source software it's

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:32,010
because no software is perfect

00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,780
um what they find over and over again is

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,560
that those bugs security and otherwise

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,940
they are fine found and fixed far more

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,000
quickly with free and open source than

00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,500
an other proprietary software so in that

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,080
way free and open source is actually

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,690
much more secure than proprietary what

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,390
does not happen quickly unfortunately is

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,400
that companies update the software that

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,230
they're using you can't update what you

00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,700
don't know you're using and that's often

00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,370
what happens is again they don't know

00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,510
those pieces of their supply chain so

00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,750
they don't know that one of them is

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:06,870
getting weak or is already broken or it

00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,550
has been compromised so um that does not

00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,170
happen and so companies shoot themselves

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,140
in the foot by not paying attention to

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,360
these things a couple of examples of

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,370
this are heartbleed we may have heard of

00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,760
this you may have heard this heartbleed

00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,440
was a problem with open SSL the primary

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,780
problem with heartbleed however was that

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,000
a lot of companies had started using

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,370
open SSL and never bothered to update it

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,380
so they were using out-of-date versions

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,920
the biggest problem of course was that

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,580
they were using open SSL and not

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,680
contributing back or otherwise

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,400
supporting the project but that's

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,350
another talk and another situation that

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,000
got a lot of attention because it

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:48,960
affected literally billions of people

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,230
was Equifax Equifax was compromised

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,280
and lost the very private information of

00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,740
billions of people

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,500
um what's a billions million anyway a

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,270
lot and this obviously hit the news

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,000
people got a little cranky about it

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,950
turned out it was hacked because there

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,540
was a vulnerability in an open source

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:10,410
project that they were using Apache

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:13,260
struts well there was a vulnerability it

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,310
had been fixed but Equifax haven't

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,859
bothered to keep their software

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,700
up-to-date and so therefore they got

00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,700
compromised

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,280
that's not struts fault that was the

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,710
poor behavior of the Equifax development

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,050
process so again this is a situation

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:32,550
where a little a tension can go a long

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:36,119
way we also need to ditch our

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,740
stereotypes over the years free and open

00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,410
source software participants have been

00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,170
painted as a bunch of unwashed fedora

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:46,109
wearing anarchic neck beards working in

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:48,089
the dark in their parents basements and

00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:51,300
I'm sorry to report that what I just

00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:54,810
said was an almost verbatim quote from a

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,700
serious business article I read and they

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,010
weren't using it sarcastically they were

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:02,310
being serious about who develops free

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:05,580
and open source software I the the image

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:07,740
is as incorrect as it is offensive free

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,380
and open source software participants we

00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:14,430
come from every country every walk of

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,589
life in every belief system so as with

00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,930
any other emerging market as your

00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:21,300
company is looking at it despite old

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,490
fashioned perception perception so you

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,109
just gotta leave those again leave them

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,990
at the door leave them at your Lehman

00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:30,450
and your liminal zone and recognize that

00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:33,330
the inhabitants of this new market are

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:37,890
not savages they are people just like

00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:41,070
you so as you are entering this emerging

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,140
market it is a relationship and as with

00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,150
all relationships each parting has needs

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,270
and perspectives that have to be heard

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:51,810
and respected by both sides company and

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,490
create open source together so do be

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,099
patient and remember it takes time to

00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,480
build up that trust in the relationship

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,369
but it's worth that effort and it's

00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,790
worth the weight it takes to get that

00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:01,790
trust

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,400
and as you're taking that time do you

00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,010
remember to continue revisiting your

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,900
goals revisit the goals and the metrics

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,450
related to them and because if you're

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,819
not on track your company has the

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,160
responsibility to fix it but you can't

00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:19,990
tell you're off track unless you look

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,089
you know if you're not looking at your

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,890
path you might not recognize that you're

00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:26,650
veering off in this direction if it

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,599
otherwise looks the same so if you have

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,490
the wrong tactics if you're in the wrong

00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,250
project if you have the wrong goals even

00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:34,809
you know continue looking so you can

00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,779
adjust these things these are carbon

00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:42,430
jellow not stone you can always make

00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:44,559
changes as you are looking to do this

00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:47,289
consider getting somebody to help you

00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,940
with that process especially if you are

00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:51,789
going to be releasing an internal

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,680
project as an open source project get a

00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:55,569
community manager because that's that

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,119
person who stands in the liminal zone

00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:59,920
they stand in between the project and

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,420
the company and they can translate

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,250
between the two they are the conduit

00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,859
through which both sides of the

00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,230
relationship can communicate and as a

00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:10,779
primary point of contact between the

00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,150
company and the project they're in a

00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:14,890
great position to be tracking those

00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,079
metrics that you came up with earlier

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,789
and they will see before anyone else

00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,130
when your company is going off the rails

00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:23,289
and when it's no longer on track to meet

00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,950
its goals so this person can save you a

00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:28,660
lot of damage later on just get them

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:34,150
support them and they can help your

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:36,339
company a great deal and finally don't

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,109
don't just learn all this don't do all

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,869
the work of coming up with a strategy

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:44,289
and entering the market and then click

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:46,539
set everything on autopilot the world is

00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:49,119
constantly changing evolving your

00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,980
company is evolving in the projects are

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,619
evolving so pay attention what's

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,279
happening inside your company and in the

00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,400
free and open source software

00:40:54,279 --> 00:41:00,250
communities in which you engage then

00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,740
adjust your your strategies adjust your

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:07,180
tactics adjust everything accordingly

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:09,430
don't fall asleep at the wheel so that

00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,069
is my last slide we have I think three

00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,630
or four minutes I am the embrasure

00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,810
director of open source strategy of

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,150
Juniper Networks I also happen to be

00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,550
this book here pictured on the screen

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,140
forge your future with open source it is

00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,730
the first and only book about how to

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,860
contribute to free and open source

00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:29,340
software projects and completely

00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,290
coincidentally it is 50% off this week I

00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,060
was really happy to see that happen

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,480
yesterday my publisher told me about

00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,760
that

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,160
so it's 50% off right now with the code

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,820
that's on the screen you can get it at

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,600
that URL foss4g calm again these slides

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,340
are available on Internet Archive um

00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,420
thank you all thank you open source 101

00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,580
for having me and thank you all for

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,930
being here now I'm going to flip on over

00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,150
to the chat see whether there are any

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,100
questions I will be ignoring anything

00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,930
that is a comment concealed as a

project that might be a good starter

00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:11,849
