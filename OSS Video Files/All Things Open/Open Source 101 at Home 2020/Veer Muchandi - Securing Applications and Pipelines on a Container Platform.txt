	Securing Applications and Pipelines on a Container Platform

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Veer Muchandi, Red Hat Inc

Abstract: While everyone wants to do Containers and Kubernetes, they don’t know what they are getting into from Security perspective. This session intends to take you from “I don’t know what I don’t know” to “I know what I don’t know”. This helps you to make informed choices on Application Security.

Kubernetes as a Container Platform is becoming a de facto for every enterprise. In my interactions with enterprises adopting container platform, I come across common questions: 

- How does application security work on this platform? What all do I need to secure? 
- How do I implement security in pipelines? 
- What about vulnerabilities discovered at a later point in time? 
- What are newer technologies like Istio Service Mesh bring to table?

In this session, I will be addressing these commonly asked questions that every enterprise trying to adopt an Enterprise Kubernetes Platform needs to know so that they can make informed decisions.
