Abstract: Open source today can be big business. Open source has not only eaten then software world, it's eating the software business. An open source project is not the same as and open source business, but developers can get from one to the other with simple, common-sense planning and knowledge -- and without losing your vision for an open source world. This session will discuss how commercial open source businesses make money, and what you can do to avoid missing opportunities to monetize your project.

[Music]

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,059
hello everyone let's get started

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,900
[Music]

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:24,720
bear with me as I figure out exactly how

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:31,289
to do this so let's see looks like we're

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:33,390
going strong here okay looking good I'm

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,460
gonna start if there's any technical

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,070
problem or anything please send me a

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,910
chat so that I can fix it okay so I'm

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,879
Heather Meeker and I'm sure I've met a

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,980
few of you before if we were in a live

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,059
room I'd be able to figure that out

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,329
better I'm going to talk today about how

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,530
to turn an open-source project into a

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,830
business and just a little bit about me

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,350
to begin with I'm a lawyer and a venture

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,299
capitalist and I have been specializing

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,460
heavily in open source software for

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,729
quite a few years now maybe longer than

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,220
it's been cool and so I'm here to ship

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,170
to share some thoughts with you today if

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,299
you're interested in turning your

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,570
project into a business how you might go

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,450
about that so we're going to talk about

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,900
licensing and business models and so

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,490
forth

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,979
so here we go okay so we all know that

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,530
open source can be a labor of love and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,780
that's great you know there are a lot of

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,009
projects that are community projects

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,680
that are never you know intended to be

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,060
commercial at all and that's fine this

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,799
presentation isn't to suggest that the

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,649
only thing that you should do is make a

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,820
business out of open source but to

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,350
provide you with some structure and

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,079
guidance about how to do it if you're

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,820
interested in doing that because lots of

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,490
people want to make a business out of

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,360
the things they love so let's talk about

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,060
how that happens so open source these

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,920
days is not only business it's big

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,880
business

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,180
and I'd like to point out that actually

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,239
you know I wrote an article a while ago

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,090
it was actually before all of this

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,420
unfortunate pandemic stuff hit it was

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,459
about a year ago about how most of the

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,550
big open source businesses were actually

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,380
started during down economies and there

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,720
are a lot of reasons for that that I

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,989
won't get into because of our time

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,180
constraints but actually times like

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,120
these that are difficult tend to produce

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,280
a lot of really interesting open source

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,819
projects that become big businesses so

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,500
it's perhaps a message of hope here that

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,200
people who are stuck at home writing

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,970
software right now I like to think that

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,330
they're coming up with the big game

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,220
changer as we speak here so let's see

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,019
what happens in a year or two when these

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,019
companies sort of come out into the open

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,910
to prove my point that open source is

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:17,450
big business this is an index that's

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,900
maintained by Joseph Jack's who is my

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,030
partner in open source software capital

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,910
and you can take a look at it if you

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,400
like but it looks at some of the biggest

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,650
open source companies and gives some

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,380
interesting thoughts about it including

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,019
roughly what their business model is but

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,760
it's very impressive list and it

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,810
includes a lot of companies that have

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,620
had you know rather spectacular exits so

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,079
you know once upon a time some people

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,820
used to ask me how can you really can

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,310
you really make money doing this and the

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,019
answer is absolutely yes there's no

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,910
question about that at this point in

00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,930
time it's just a question of how you're

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,660
going to go about it

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,660
and that's the index which you can look

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,209
at online if you like later very

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:10,190
interesting okay to turn your project

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:12,440
into a business from project to profit

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,639
there are a few things you need to think

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,880
about and we're going to talk about

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:19,669
those today so the first important most

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,859
important thing is to understand what

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:24,770
your business model is and we'll talk a

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:27,020
lot about different business models

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,000
you might want to consider the next

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,340
thing that you need to do is you need to

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,770
take care of your branding and you need

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,659
to take care of it early and often it's

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,729
almost one of the first things you

00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:41,539
should do we'll talk about that a little

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:44,240
bit but if there's one thing that I like

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:46,909
bit of advice that I give people who are

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,909
starting open source businesses that I

00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:52,220
think tends to help them a lot it's to

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:54,949
pay attention to branding from day one

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,830
and then I'll give a few tips which are

00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:00,380
not exactly legal advice but sort of

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,060
general commercial you know kind of

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,400
straddles legal and business advice

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,750
about getting your project ready for

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,610
primetime in order to release it okay

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,419
I'm gonna talk first about business

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,969
models okay so my first piece of it is

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,300
don't be the underpants gnomes no to

00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:23,539
understand this meme you have to be a a

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,210
South Park fan and I understand that now

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm dating myself by using this meme at

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,710
all but the underpants gnomes were these

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,569
little creatures who went around and

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,580
stole Underpants from people and when

00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:37,880
they were asked why they said well we

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,729
have a you know a business plan phase

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,669
one collect Underpants phase two

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,500
question marks phase three profit scope

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,259
you need to understand what's in that

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,419
question mark here phase one would be

00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:54,259
having an open source project in phase

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,659
three is profit and we need to talk

00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,389
about how to get from A to B because if

00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:01,490
you want to run you know a healthy

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,199
company and maybe you want some

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,000
investors you're gonna have to explain

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,750
the question mark so now we're going to

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,740
talk about that okay so in every every

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,810
open source business model is to some

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,009
extent what I would call a razorblades

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:22,960
model so this is another mean much older

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:25,849
than me even you know it came at least

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,400
theoretically from King Jillette who

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:32,060
started the Gillette razor company and

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,210
what he said was give them the razors

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,669
and sell them the blades so in any kind

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,990
of business model that involves giving

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,300
some

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,860
way you have to be selling something if

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,840
you're not selling something you don't

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,610
have a business you may have a labor of

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,380
love but you won't have a business so

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,600
the main thing about open source

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,370
businesses is to figure out exactly what

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,080
you're selling and there are a lot of

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,390
different approaches that businesses

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,510
have used all of them have been used

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,180
successfully so the first and most

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,160
obvious is maintenance and support and

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,050
I'm going to tell you in a moment that I

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,440
think this pure model doesn't really

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,930
exist but I will explain why so the the

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,360
idea is you have an open source project

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,430
so people can use a software freely for

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,990
anything they like and then you offer

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,610
maintenance and support and

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,440
theoretically they come to you because

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,350
you're the one who knows the most about

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,680
the software so this business model

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,720
certainly works the thing is about

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,630
maintenance and support is that it's a

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,660
human resources heavy business model and

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,600
it requires people with lots of skill

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,960
and that's all great but it's what we

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,480
say not scalable in the in Silicon

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,580
Valley because in order for a business

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,910
to scale you need some kind of product

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,940
and pure human resource type services

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,130
are very hard to scale and make high

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,350
profits on so if you're trying to get

00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,000
people invested to invest in a business

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,280
you have to show them what the return

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,500
philosophy is now I'm a lawyer for the

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,900
most part and so I'm intimately familiar

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,540
with the fact that human resources

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,970
businesses don't scale well it's exactly

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:16,030
the problem that accountants and lawyers

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,640
and consultants have you can make a

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,100
business out of it but it tends to be

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,780
very bounded by the number of hours

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,990
people have in the day that they're

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,960
willing to work so while this is an

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,360
obvious model it's not how most of the

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,420
really successful companies make money

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,790
this is more like providing a job for

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,380
you which if you're the starting the

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,840
open source project which by the way is

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,400
fine it says if you want to kind of take

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,650
it to the next level you have to go

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,950
beyond maintenance and support and by

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,410
the way you know people tend to use

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,350
these terms together but technically

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,680
maintenance

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,170
is updates and so forth and support is

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,110
the human interaction of helping people

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,730
to do things so maintenance in an

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,710
open-source project is really free to

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,100
anybody right nobody has to pay for that

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:10,070
because you're releasing new you know

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,650
updates to the general public and

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,960
anybody can use them so this is really a

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,020
model about support and that's why I say

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,770
it's not scalable okay but now I'm gonna

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,390
say that the companies you think of that

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,640
are running a maintenance and support

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,980
model are really selling you something

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,010
else and what they're selling you is

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,160
Quality Assurance okay so my picture

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,340
here is at the pet rock which also dates

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,370
me this is a fad I think in the 70s or

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,440
80s and it's a basically they put some

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,540
eyes on a rock and put it in a box with

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,470
a nice logo and sold it and it was

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,090
hugely popular a big fad so what's the

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,600
difference between the rock and the pet

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:56,690
rock well somebody is applying their

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,730
like branding and their quality control

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,280
to it because I guess you know you

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,980
wouldn't get a rock with jagged edges or

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,100
something like that right so what people

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,600
are doing here it would you know

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,710
analogizing the open source situation is

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:17,240
they're saying here's my product and it

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:18,350
has my brand on it and that means it's a

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,860
product you want

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,100
okay so branding and quality insurance

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,070
get quality assurance go hand-in-hand

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:31,670
okay so here's a thing people don't buy

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,830
source code customers buy products and

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,160
that means a products that's been built

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,990
and has a certain reputation that it's

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,380
going to be maintained over time and so

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,970
forth

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,690
so when you look at the really big

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,400
companies that are basically deploying a

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,490
maintenance and support model like say

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,530
Red Hat which had an enormous exit

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,260
really what they're selling in a sense

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:57,140
is quality control and their brand means

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,330
a lot people by Red Hat software because

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,030
it's Red Hat software and they're not

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,760
paying for licenses but on a certain

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,320
level IT managers don't care

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,880
you know they're buying something that

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,730
will work for them to solve a problem

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,190
and that's not intellectual property or

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,890
copyright right licences that's an

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,350
actual product so if you're going for is

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,660
kind of the most basic model you're

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,970
really selling a quality assurance to

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,030
people now this is a hard model to

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,360
deploy and the conventional wisdom is

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:32,810
that quote-unquote there's only one red

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,250
hat and the reason people say that you

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,460
know a lot when they're talking about

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,920
open source businesses is that Red Hat

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,510
had a huge project behind it like the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,590
biggest most valuable open-source

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,900
project in the world

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,440
and so they had a huge marketplace and

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:51,320
so they could they could benefit from

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,990
economies of scale okay so that's one

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,810
model the next model I'm going to

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,870
suggest to you with online services this

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,540
model has typically worked really well

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,630
in the small to medium enterprise area

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:09,200
so think about WordPress they WordPress

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,880
is a great product wordpress.com which

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,610
is by the way where I run my own

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,160
personal sort of website and blog is

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,380
basically online services and it's there

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,080
for lazy people like me who don't want

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:27,590
to run their own website so that works

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,300
great but it sometimes tends to work

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,600
better for people who don't have their

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,910
own IT system so the sales tend to be

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,960
high volume low price sales now the

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,460
exception that proves that rule is

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:47,860
github which is essentially online

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:53,480
services for the git project but github

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:56,120
you know very smartly created a platform

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,960
where everyone wanted to be because they

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,260
were sort of an early market entrant and

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,430
they provided a lot of extra bells and

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,070
whistles and and shall we say

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:13,040
conservation of the of the online

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,230
platform and community so that's the

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,200
online services model you're using an

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:21,530
open-source piece of software which

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:26,470
maybe made available I like the comments

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,470
about but in the image job by the way

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,680
they they provide services surrounding

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,160
the software but theoretically anyone

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,160
could run their own instance of it okay

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,380
next is professional services and again

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,270
this is a model that doesn't scale very

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,870
well because it's human resource heavy

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,370
and there aren't a ton of you know

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,980
businesses that you would recognize

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,460
today that are doing this and making

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,560
lots of money in the open-source space

00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,920
one that I remember was a company called

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,590
Monta Vista which did custom Linux

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,900
systems mostly for embedded and there

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,850
are certainly people still doing that

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,980
they don't tend to be big companies they

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,410
tend to be small developers so

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,350
professional services around open-source

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,470
doing customizations may be custom

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:22,190
features that is definitely a business

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:25,220
model but it has scaling issues the next

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:28,970
on is sometimes called widget frosting

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,920
that's a cute term but what that means

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,860
is that you're taking the open-source

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,190
software and you're using it to sell

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:44,270
custom hardware so an example of this

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:48,620
might be like the Kindle it might be the

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,120
the Digium telecom platform and so forth

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,710
what you're doing is she's saying I'm

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,410
giving away the software then to sell

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,900
you the hardware and the limitation of

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,390
this model is it hardware sales have low

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,980
margins so you have to have high volume

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,020
but it's definitely a business model

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,180
that can work and by the way there are

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,070
tons of companies who release open

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,810
source software in order to get you to

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,940
use their custom hardware products

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:15,530
that's all over the place you know

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,240
almost every IOT device right then

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,040
here's an interesting one that most

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,130
people don't think of and I call it the

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,130
embargo model so what happens here is

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,410
that you have an open source project but

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,410
you give early access to people who are

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,410
paying for it what that

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,300
means is that you're doing a custom

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,670
proprietary software agreement with your

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,690
best customers and they get a first look

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:45,490
at new features now this works well in

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:48,819
markets where a you know a small entry

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,529
advantage is huge for instance consumer

00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:53,589
electronics which you know have a

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,779
half-life of about 15 seconds or you

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:59,620
have to buy a new one right so if you're

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:02,189
doing software for say smartphones

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,379
you're doing software for some kind of

00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:07,029
consumer electronic device then you can

00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:09,279
provide your customers with a lot of

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,649
value just by giving them early access

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,079
and then later on you give the community

00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,389
access so this is sort of a staged

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,490
release model and by the way a lot of

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,649
companies do this and really don't make

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,470
much hay about it but that's how they

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:28,149
are sort of eking the the business

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:31,959
benefit out of the open source model the

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:34,990
next is dual licensing and the the

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,920
pictures here the first picture of the

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,029
really cute little babies is

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,730
representing when you have dual

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,250
licensing where the products are

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,720
identical but the licenses are different

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:52,569
so this model was pioneered by MySQL and

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,220
basically it's saying here's a software

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:57,459
and it's usually under something like

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:02,050
GPL or a GPL a very like strong coffee

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,390
left license and and we'll give this to

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,730
you for free under the open-source

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,409
license and if you don't want to abide

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,510
by the conditions in that license you

00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:13,179
can pay us for an exception so that's

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,909
what I would call classic dual licensing

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:18,640
and then there is a variation on that

00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,500
which is sometimes called open core or

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,510
upsell or lots of other things we're

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,000
going to talk about that in a bit but

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,370
the picture there is of fraternal twins

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,500
so they're almost the same but they're

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,799
not quite the same and one is going to

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,020
be the commercial the commercial or

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,700
Enterprise version and the other is

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,710
going to be the open-source version and

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,120
typically when companies do this they

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,059
they put the features in

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,160
the commercial version that are of most

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,430
used to the biggest customers so

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,320
essentially what they're saying is

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,360
here's the community version and maybe

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,460
small to medium enterprises or

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,070
individuals will use that but if you

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,980
want to deploy this at scale we're going

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:07,870
to provide proprietary upsell for you to

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:11,470
do this so I'm going to talk a little

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,450
bit more about open core and the reason

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,710
I'm doing that is that if you look back

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:21,940
at our like Koski index that I started

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:24,309
with you'll see that many of the most

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,670
successful companies deployed this

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:31,420
particular business model so in open

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:34,240
core you've got a core that is true open

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,330
source under an open source license and

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,960
then you've got add-ons that are under

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:47,500
other kinds of licenses so there are

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:52,380
tons of examples of this and and some of

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:58,140
the most you know well-known ones are

00:18:52,380 --> 00:19:00,490
confluent Redis elastic those are not

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,290
coincidentally all in the sort of little

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:08,110
weird database space and and there have

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,270
been lots of examples of this over the

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:13,360
years but what you do in this model it's

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:16,030
a fraternal twins model so you say the

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,160
core is an open source project and you

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,620
may or may not as a company even run

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,780
that project but what you do is you

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,090
develop the enterprise features for the

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,040
product and then you're the experts in

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,600
deploying that in the enterprise and

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,360
when you sell it to the enterprise

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,429
you're essentially licensing it under a

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,870
proprietary license providing

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,179
maintenance and support and all the

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:42,210
other things that one would expect from

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:46,900
an open source of from a business model

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:50,350
okay so that's open core where you have

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,890
oh good you can think you can see my

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,790
cursor moving so you've got the OSS core

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,310
and by the way these days

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,850
almost all of them are under Apache too

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:04,340
because that's become such a popular

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,040
license particularly for corporate use

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:11,120
and then the add-ons are under other

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,390
kinds of licenses and those licenses can

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,600
actually vary quite a bit I see a

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,850
comment here Magento is like that

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,990
Enterprise Edition is community plus

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,240
proprietary add-ons

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:28,820
yeah Magento I believe is one of the

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:31,070
companies on the Koski Index isn't Red

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,500
Hat well that's the the question is

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,840
isn't Red Hat like this as well I think

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,790
you might get some controversy over that

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,460
and it won't speak for where I'd had but

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:44,990
I believe Red Hat doesn't have any

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:48,290
proprietary features but they do have

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:51,080
you know a like maintenance support

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:54,560
quality control and also they have their

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,750
own builds that they sell and that lies

00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,350
somewhere in between software and

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,330
services right but they're not doing the

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,890
open core upsell the way a lot of the

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,410
other companies are I'm just going to

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,900
answer a couple of the comments here

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:14,600
let's see at what point it changes from

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,240
open-source software that you can use

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,390
free to product you use to make a profit

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,460
well so that depends on where you're

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:26,060
gonna set the line between these things

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,070
so let's talk a little bit about more

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,720
about how you do this and I'm pausing a

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,030
long time on this open core slide

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,370
because this is what most people want to

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,350
do in business these days although there

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,650
are all those other models so if you

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,390
wanted to play a business like this you

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,450
have to figure out what the dividing

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:48,800
line is between your open core and your

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:51,470
proprietary upsell models and also there

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,920
may be more more than two buckets so

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,220
what we've what I've demonstrated on

00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,750
this slide in a very simplistic way is

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,020
essentially a two bucket model so you've

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:05,780
got your core under Apache to say and

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,120
you've got your add-ons under your

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,610
proprietary license and because you are

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,590
the developer

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:15,160
at least of the add-ons you get to

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,010
decide where this dividing line is so

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,070
you have to make a decision about what

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:23,860
people will buy and so you'll get money

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:29,020
for it and therefore that will be the

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:31,660
maximum benefit to your business whereas

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,340
for the core which is open source that's

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,460
where you're going to get community

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,340
support get people contributing to the

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,320
project and so that will also have a

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,600
benefit to your business but you're not

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,070
going to get money for licensing it you

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,470
might get money for maintenance and

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,230
support and so forth but not money for

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,080
licenses so the trick to deploying the

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,090
open core model is figuring out which of

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,150
the parts should be free and community

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:07,120
supported and which parts are your

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:10,630
business ok I'm gonna no look the wrong

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,750
way okay I'm gonna go back here I'm I'm

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:17,680
going to answer a question or read a

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,780
couple of the comments the biggest

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,850
drawback to open core is that it signals

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,400
to open source users what features won't

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:27,490
be available to them I tend to avoid it

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,800
as a consumer and I think that's an

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,940
interesting comment in it and it points

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:36,220
up how much art there is to deploying a

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:41,200
model like this because you don't want

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,230
to alienate your your community by

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,350
putting too many things in the upsell

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:51,820
buckets right you really want the upsell

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:56,020
buckets only to be for the the software

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,360
that is going to be for people who don't

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,440
want want to buy it and don't want to do

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,900
it themselves right and so the corollary

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,870
to that is you need to understand your

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,880
market right so if you don't understand

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,010
the market and who's likely to buy and

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,630
who's not likely to buy see your

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,520
customers are making a build buy

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,550
decision and they're gonna make that

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,470
based on the license terms and also how

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,420
much effort it will be to deploy things

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,410
themselves so you have to figure out

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,380
where to draw that

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:29,020
in order not to alienate your community

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,160
I see another comment that says both

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,260
ends of open-source licenses are booming

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,540
copy left and not copy left with

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:41,170
response with respect to Apache 2 and a

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,120
GPL and that's true but the clients that

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,070
I work with and the businesses that I

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,180
work with these days they're

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:55,450
overwhelmingly choosing a Apache 2 as

00:24:49,180 --> 00:25:03,630
their core because oops I'm sorry go

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:07,900
back here wait sorry about that

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:10,720
and not behind the wheel ok so yeah I'm

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,460
seeing mostly Apache but the reason for

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,260
that is that one of the philosophies of

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,170
deploying an open core model is that

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:23,170
your open source element whatever it is

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,210
the core you want massive adoption of

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,680
that very quickly and it's easier to

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,330
accomplish that with a permissive

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,570
license than it is with a license like a

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:34,360
GPL a GPL will do more to forestall

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,490
competition it's an imperfect way to do

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,310
that by the way and that's kind of

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,620
another subject from this talk but the

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,450
point is that people are overwhelmingly

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:48,030
choosing the permissive licenses because

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:53,140
they are so easy to get people to adopt

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:56,110
ok so I'm going to move on here I'm

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,540
gonna mention a project that I was

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,630
involved in and I'm not gonna go into

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,170
this a lot because this is a whole

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:07,090
another hour of dock right but if you

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,630
were looking at what happened in late

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:15,100
2008 and early 2009 sorry late 2018

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:18,130
early 2019 a lot of companies that were

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,580
open core model were sort of rebalancing

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,730
their portfolio so to speak and take and

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,360
taking some of the code and maybe from

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:33,430
open source to their proprietary buckets

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:37,030
and and vice versa right and when that

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:39,160
happened a a kind of license started

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,110
becoming very popular which I would call

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,940
source available there's not really a

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,370
great word for what it is but it's not

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,490
open source because although it makes

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,860
source code available it is it has

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,170
license restrictions and once that

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,210
happened I actually started this project

00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,790
to write some standardized licenses and

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:01,600
the reason I did that is because I love

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:03,520
standardization I'm a big fan and one of

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,890
the great things about open source is it

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,660
is standardized I mean even setting

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,430
aside you know the fact that it's really

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,470
great that it you know grants you all

00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,540
these rights and freedoms and so forth

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,730
it's standardized and that makes that

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,130
that makes it easy for adopters to

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,440
understand it so I started this project

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,180
in order to give little open core

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,340
companies a way to adopt a standard

00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,830
license so if you're looking at

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,270
deploying an open core model you want to

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,980
you might want to take a look at this

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,420
project and if you have more questions

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:36,220
about it feel free to reach out to me so

00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,010
the way that this would work for

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,620
instance is that the core is Apache and

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,310
then the add-ons instead of being

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,430
full-on proprietary or just SAS are some

00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:50,470
source available license and I suggested

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,810
here non-commercial which is essentially

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,520
a license that says here's the software

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,860
you can use it for all non-commercial

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,680
purposes and this force stalls a fair

00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,920
amount of competition but not all

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,780
competition and so this is a way to get

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,720
out the door quickly with an open core

00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:12,580
model okay now I'm going to move on to

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,260
branding and by the way I'm going to

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,940
reserve a little bit of time at the end

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:21,550
for questions so hope there will be some

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,530
so if you have questions that that you

00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,250
want to make sure get answered feel free

00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:30,040
to save them up until then or I'll try

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,860
to I'll try to just follow the the

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,510
comments as it goes on so let's talk

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,170
about branding so I told you that

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:40,780
branding is the most one most important

00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:44,410
things that you have to attend to to

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,480
deploy an open-source business so let's

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,480
talk about some of the businesses we

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,250
love here and what they're doing with

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,970
branding

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:57,810
so here you've got the support and

00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:01,220
quality control type business and you'll

00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:03,960
see that these brands are you know

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,230
extremely well known brands you've got

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,540
the open core model which I just give

00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,030
confluent as an example of it and then

00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:17,850
you've got the cloud services model

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:20,910
which is you know you've got cloud era

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:25,650
and hadoop and you've got git and github

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:28,590
there so all of these companies one

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,620
thing that they did well in deploying

00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,130
their business models was that they paid

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,130
attention to branding from the get-go

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:42,450
and what I'd like to point out to you

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:45,180
about this is that the brand for red hat

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,780
is different from Fedora which is their

00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,580
open source project and the Brantford

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:53,130
confluent is different from kafka which

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,320
is their open source core and the brand

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,800
for cloud era which is built around

00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,080
Hadoop is entirely different and the

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,330
brand for github which is built around

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:08,610
gibb yet well those are kind of similar

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:11,040
but they but you probably don't think of

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,200
them as entirely the same thing so what

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,390
I wanted to demonstrate to you here is

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,880
that the businesses who are doing a

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,970
really good job on branding are creating

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,330
a separate brand for their commercial

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:27,210
offering different from the open source

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:30,120
that is the basis for their business and

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:34,530
while this can be a kind of a hard sell

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,600
in the marketplace does give me it's a

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:39,030
very good thing to do so if you're

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,480
thinking of deploying an open source

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,900
business it's much better to start out

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,120
thinking about how you are going to

00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:52,230
differentiate your commercial project

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:55,200
product from your open source the core

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:58,260
of your business and to go in fairly

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,500
different directions with them if you

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,940
call your business some variation of the

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,019
open source core well

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,059
get in github that's doable but at the

00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:11,950
end of the day you're going to have a

00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:14,250
lot more business advantage with a

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,750
separate brand and so I highly recommend

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:19,690
that people think about this when

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,700
they're starting an open-source business

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:25,750
Pablo I see your question for the end

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,570
and I will answer it when I get to the

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:33,039
end of my prepared more or less prepared

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,870
remarks thank you okay now I'm going to

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,750
talk for a couple of minutes about

00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,669
getting ready for primetime so what I

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,879
mean by this is that when you're going

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:45,340
to release a project that's going to

00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:46,720
form the basis of a business there are a

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,090
few things that you ought to think about

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,269
and some of these are going to be

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,889
painfully obvious to you I think most of

00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,889
the people who are attending here are

00:31:53,889 --> 00:32:00,340
developers but when I talk to in-house

00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:03,639
lawyers and sort of CEOs and so forth

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,610
who are not technologists they typically

00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:09,220
don't know about this stuff and so I

00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:12,100
like to say this so that people have a

00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,980
kind of checklist for getting ready you

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:20,070
know to put your best foot forward when

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:23,970
you do your open source release okay so

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:26,799
when you release an open source project

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,590
there is a tendency and it's not wrong

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,419
to just get the code out there and get

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,940
people interested in it and that's all

00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:37,090
well and good but when you are going to

00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,409
use your open source project as a basis

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:42,100
for a serious business

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:44,559
you need good documentation and you know

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,629
I used to be a programmer and I know

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,610
that donek documentation is never good

00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:51,759
because there's never enough time to

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,529
create all of it but you really need to

00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,470
take a look at how professional your

00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:58,419
documentation looks make sure that

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:02,649
you've got documentation that is for

00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:05,820
both users and developers and and make

00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,779
sure that it looks professional you know

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,830
you know put it through the spell

00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:13,840
checker and everything so if you want to

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:16,059
release a project and have it be like

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,510
taken seriously from business point of

00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,490
view by your customers who

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,230
are thinking of adopting it or even

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,780
playing around with it when you first

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,480
release it it's best to have some good

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,630
documentation so take the time to write

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,460
that and and pay attention to it because

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:36,230
it matters next you may have seen there

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,450
was you know there's been a fair amount

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:44,360
of news lately about codes of conduct in

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,180
open source projects and I won't go into

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,770
all the gory details about that and if

00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,420
you're interested in this topic there's

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,300
some stuff on my blog about it and

00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,360
plenty of other places too but you know

00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,820
these days a professional open source

00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,950
project has a code of conduct and you

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,650
know the codes of conduct basically say

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,750
you know be respectful of each other and

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:09,530
and and then they say something about

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:12,710
how complaints are going to be handled

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,780
and that's so you do not want to go down

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,600
the route that some of the open source

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:22,000
projects have gone down having you know

00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:25,340
people get alienated you know started

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,909
Twitter war and so forth about how

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,860
they're treated when they try to

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,899
contribute to a project if you want your

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,850
project to be taken seriously by

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,770
business then you have to pay attention

00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,710
to the culture of business and these

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,690
days the culture of business requires

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,230
this kind of sort of professional

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,850
interaction the the days of I wouldn't

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,480
say that the days of the kind of the

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:54,200
incredibly blunt benevolent dictator for

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,450
life are over but if you want your

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,040
open-source project to be business then

00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,750
you have to treat it like business and

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,060
code of conduct is one of the ways to do

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,610
that by the way if you want to just grab

00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,800
a code of conduct take a look at the one

00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,770
that Mozilla promulgates it's a pretty

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,140
good one and that's just an example

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,970
there are plenty of different examples

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,780
out there are plenty of different styles

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:21,560
but consider coding a code of conduct in

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,240
github repository from day one the next

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,420
thing you have to figure out is your

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,470
contribution licenses and again this is

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,630
a completely separate topic

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,250
when you release an open-source project

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,599
and you apply a license to it like

00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:42,040
Apache or like a GPL what you're doing

00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,660
is you're saying what license terms are

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,970
what license rights are flowing from the

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,359
project out to the world so we call that

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,270
an outbound license but when people give

00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,579
you code as a contribution you have to

00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,130
figure out what the inbound license is

00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:01,099
and there are essentially a couple of

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,710
ways of doing that one is by using

00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:06,470
what's called licensing equals license

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,720
out and that's very popular with some

00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,630
projects for instance the linux kernel

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,630
is like that everybody who contributes

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,000
is contributing under GPL two which is

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,619
the outbound license as well they

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,140
actually use something called a

00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:23,990
developer sort of certificate of

00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:26,180
originality which is not a license but

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,790
it's sort of a guarantee that the person

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,820
actually wrote what they are

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,890
contributing but that's the license and

00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,010
equals license out model and by the way

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,950
if you run a project on github the

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,619
github terms actually say that if you

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:45,349
don't say otherwise and this is in the

00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:48,349
Terms of Use that apply to contributors

00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:51,020
if you don't say otherwise then the

00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:55,220
contribution will be under the outbound

00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:58,099
license however there are some projects

00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,440
particularly ones that run corporate

00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:04,369
projects that run under something like a

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,589
GPL or GPL and they actually use what's

00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:08,630
called a contribution license and what

00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:11,990
that means is that your contributors are

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,390
giving you a broad unrestricted license

00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,970
to use whatever they contribute so why

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:19,490
why why might you need to use that well

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:23,569
if the contributors are contributing to

00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,849
the proprietary bits of your open core

00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:28,609
model you need to actually clear those

00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:31,099
rights so you need to decide how this is

00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:33,770
going to work for your project and there

00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:36,680
are lots of roads you could go down here

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,520
you can use either scheme that I

00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,020
described and also you can for instance

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,670
not take contributions to your propriety

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,970
cherry pieces if you're running open

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:51,150
core but you got to figure that out

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:53,070
maybe not on the day you launch but you

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,630
have to figure it out before you take

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,760
your first contributions from the

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,250
community so it needs to be done early

00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,910
on and that's probably a conversation

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,790
with a lawyer unfortunately so need to

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,590
figure that out and deploy it in your

00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:12,300
open source launch and then also this is

00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,370
also something that you might get away

00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,440
with not doing on day one but

00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,000
governments and succession planning are

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,520
really important if you want your

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,110
customers to take seriously the fact

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,110
that you're offering a commercial

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:28,740
product you need to make sure that the

00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:32,670
project does not go away when the person

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:36,630
who started it either moves on to

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:39,690
another sphere or you know retires or

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,760
whatever so having some succession

00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,970
planning is one of the elements that

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,220
will give customers confidence that your

00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:50,580
project is going to be supported going

00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:53,400
forward and of course customers not only

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,690
want that on a business level but they

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,940
want to make sure that you're going to

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,310
keep the products secure going forward

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,140
so you have to have some kind of

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:04,290
sustainable model to keep it going

00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,720
and if that is a corporation that has

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:09,420
investors and stockholders and so forth

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,510
great but you need to make sure that

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,350
that your open source project is not

00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,210
sort of a cult of personality that is

00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:22,410
dependent on a single person paying

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:24,720
attention to it okay

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,000
so those are some suggestions about

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,030
things to think about to make your

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,560
project sort of ready for primetime on a

00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:36,330
business level I'm going to answer a few

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,350
of the questions we have about five

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:42,810
minutes left and I see one and it says

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,870
you said a GPL three is an imperfect way

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,120
to forestall contant competition I'd

00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:51,660
like you to elaborate that also why you

00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:55,590
assumed a GPL three would be chosen for

00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,730
that purpose okay so I'll try to make

00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,890
this kind of the short for

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:03,660
because it's potentially a long topic

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:07,200
but a Faro GPL was created because of

00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:12,270
the so called you know sass loophole in

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:15,120
GPO so if you put well let me start over

00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:19,140
again if you go back in time about 20

00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,540
years most software was distributed if

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:26,100
it was in a commercial prod product and

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:28,920
so if you put software out under GPL you

00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:32,370
would make it difficult to impossible

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,310
for somebody to incorporate that into a

00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:37,020
commercial project product and sell it

00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:40,410
because they would probably be

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:43,380
distributing software as software moved

00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:46,500
to the cloud there was something that

00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,170
was called the SAS loophole or a few

00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,870
other names and the thing is that the

00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,330
obligations of the conditions of GPL to

00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:58,020
share source code don't kick in until

00:40:54,330 --> 00:41:01,050
you distribute the software and so more

00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,630
and more people were offering software

00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,670
as a service and when they did that they

00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,310
weren't distributing the software and so

00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:13,110
they weren't obligated to abide by the

00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:16,620
conditions of GPL so the the Free

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:19,890
Software Foundation when it when it

00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,870
moved to GPL version 3 made an alternate

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,490
version called a pharoah GPL and it was

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:26,250
called out for historical reasons

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,070
because there was a product called a

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:34,530
pharaoh that had a similar license and a

00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:36,750
pharaoh GPL treats SAS use sort of like

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,150
distribution in the sense that if you

00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,670
use a software for SAS use and you

00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:44,670
modify it you have to make the source

00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:47,790
code available to users so that was

00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,340
typically considered at that point the

00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:56,240
best license for a dual licensing model

00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:58,590
because it was seen as as as

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,290
discouraging people from using the

00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:05,100
software in commercial settings then

00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:07,710
what happened was that people would

00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,720
start using the software for SAS but

00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:13,030
when they were creating sort of

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,750
extra bells and whistles for it to sell

00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,310
momently

00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,530
they would actually create those bells

00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:23,470
and whistles outside the scope of the

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:29,050
program that was covered by a GPL and so

00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:31,119
you saw a bunch of really big cloud

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,680
services providers when you see people

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,300
talk about this in the news are always

00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,280
talking about Amazon but it's not the

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,250
only example all of the big cloud

00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,880
services providers we're using a bunch

00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:44,770
of open source software and they were

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,720
making lots of money from it and not

00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,540
really sharing anything back with the

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:54,070
developers and so that was the issue

00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:55,840
that arose in late 2018 and you saw a

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,330
bunch of the companies that were in the

00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,859
database and middleware space saying a

00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:05,109
GPO isn't enough to keep us healthy as a

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:06,730
going concern because all these

00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:08,859
companies are using our stuff without

00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:13,810
paying us so that was the essential

00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:16,630
issue with a GPL and why you know it was

00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:18,310
very popular as a dual licensing model

00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,650
for a while but it has become less

00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:26,500
popular over time another question we

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:30,520
have a couple minutes left George hi

00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,080
George nice to see you on here what

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,150
factors would you consider in

00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,010
determining if a project is suitable for

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,589
profit-making number of downloads

00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,369
contributions etc well that's a really

00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:42,250
good question

00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:45,640
this downloads don't really equate to

00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:47,320
sales there may be an indicator but

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,500
they're not a sufficient condition for

00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,619
sales so I would say that's really the

00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,869
difference between sort of the question

00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:58,869
mark for the underpants gnomes right a

00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:00,160
lot of downloads are great but that

00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,130
doesn't mean people are going to pay you

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,780
for your software and so in order to

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,400
figure out whether it makes sense to

00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,670
make a business out of an open-source

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,530
project on you have to figure out what

00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:16,000
you're going to be selling for people to

00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:17,890
pay you and it's going to depend on what

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,750
the what your average customer is going

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,150
to look like big small what are they

00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,369
doing with the software it's going to

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,990
depend on what the

00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:28,539
you know what you think your profit

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,749
margin is how many other kinds of

00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:33,609
services you can sell in a bundle like

00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:35,680
SAS and maintenance and support and so

00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,930
forth and so sorry to give a namby-pamby

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,869
answer here but there are a lot of

00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:44,859
factors but downloads' is a good

00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:47,380
indicator of a potential project for a

00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:49,809
business but it's not a sufficient

00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,640
condition it's really a separate

00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:55,089
analysis to figure out whether it works

00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:01,869
as a business I got one more minute I

00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:04,869
see a question from let's see from

00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:06,640
Nathaniel are there specific gotchas or

00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:09,309
considerations for building business

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,309
around another orgs open source project

00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:15,579
github forget cloud era for Hadoop etc

00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:17,740
yes the main thing you got to figure out

00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:20,019
there with two things I think first is

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,480
branding if someone else is running the

00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:24,339
project you can't use their brand and so

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,230
you really need to put a lot of effort

00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:28,720
into establishing your own brand so

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,690
that's super important the other thing

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,710
is that you your much you're probably

00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:39,579
much better off being a robust part of

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:41,440
that project then you are forking it and

00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:44,200
so you need to make sure that you're

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,160
keeping up excellent relations with that

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,569
project and they you know you won't go

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,319
your separate ways because that won't be

00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:55,589
good for probably either of you so I I

00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,989
see where at the end of the session I

00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:01,660
thank everybody for attending this was a

00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:03,730
lot of fun and thanks for all the

00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,769
wonderful questions and comments that

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:09,549
was that was really great to see all of

00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:12,039
the interaction there and if here by the

00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:14,289
way on this slide is information about

00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,109
my book you can get a free copy by going

00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:19,720
to my website and following the

00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:21,999
instructions there and I'm the easiest

00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,200
person on world in the world to find so

00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:26,109
if you have any follow-up questions

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,900
please reach out I'm happy this is my

00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:32,049
favorite topic thanks everybody enjoy

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,220
