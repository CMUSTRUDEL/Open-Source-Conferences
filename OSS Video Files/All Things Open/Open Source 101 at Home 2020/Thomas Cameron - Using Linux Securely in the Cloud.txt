Presented by: Thomas Cameron, Amazon Web Services

Abstract: Securing Linux can be a challenge, whether in a datacenter or in the cloud. But, because of the multi-layer security provided by cloud providers, it's easy to lose sight of the need to harden your Linux instances. In this talk, Amazon Web Services Senior Solution Architect Thomas Cameron will discuss hardening your Linux instances for cloud computing. Thomas will discuss choosing package sets, enabling, disabling, and hardening services, firewalling options, logging, user management, patching, Security Enhanced Linux, and more. By the end of this session, attendees should have an understanding of the various options and responsibilities they have to keep their workloads secure.
