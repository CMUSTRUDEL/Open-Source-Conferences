Title: Open Source 101 at Home 2020: Jennifer Davis - Open Source in the Time of COVID-19
Publication date: 2020-05-18
Playlist: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Description: 
	Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Jennifer Davis, Microsoft

Abstract: COVID-19 presents us with an unanticipated crisis that many of us are continuing to struggle with. While open-source often focuses on what you can do for the community, Jennifer is here to tell you it's okay to ask "what can the community do for me?" - whether you are a maintainer, a contributor, or a first-time open source participant.

In this talk, Jennifer will get personal about the struggle of work during a crisis and leveraging the community of open source to strengthen connections, learn new skills, and contribute in meaningful ways.

[Music]

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,059
thank you so much for joining me today

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,869
for the open source on the time of Kovac

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,320
19 so I want to be clear that this is

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,720
not a talk about productivity I don't

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,210
want you to just jump in and start

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,849
putting as much pull request and

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,529
continue open source do what you need to

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,829
do in this time and if Animal Crossing

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,540
or baking sourdough or doing nothing is

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,059
helping you that's the right thing for

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,160
you to be doing we do have an

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,590
opportunity to shape and direct the way

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,170
we work to embrace more strategies and

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,539
processes from open source and I'm happy

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:54,570
to talk about those over in chat or in

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:56,309
the Microsoft Azure booth area so I'm

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,820
going to get personal here and I might

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,039
get a little feels it started with a

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,379
slight fever my three-year-old son

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,420
seemed a bit irritable and his

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,850
temperature was measuring at 99 degrees

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,430
so we weren't really worried it wasn't

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,229
high fever we've been following our stay

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,840
at home orders here in Santa Clara and

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,369
the last socialization we'd had was at

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,340
his preschool so it wasn't a big deal

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:27,990
until the next morning his screams woke

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,689
me up I can't breathe mama he was

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,990
burning up and his temperature was 104

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,829
he was gasping he was wheezing and on

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,630
one level I knew that talking was a sign

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,850
that he was breathing because you can't

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,340
talk if he can't breathe on another

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,850
there was a slow panic brewing like what

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,100
is this we called her doctor and they

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,920
said come in and we went to one of these

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,840
driving clinics and we're told to wait

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,060
in the car I hadn't bought through it

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,189
the whole idea of Frankie meeting a

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,070
doctor he doesn't know and personal

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,390
protective equipment he's only three so

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,549
we explained that the doctor was a

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,459
superhero who wanted to help him feel

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,910
better well Frankie appreciates a good

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,410
superhero story so he let the doctor

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,600
take his temperature

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,480
take his blood pressure in his oxygen

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,390
saturation Frankie wasn't sick enough to

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,450
be tested but we were told assume that

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,930
he is positive for kovat so now we were

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,520
going into a next level of isolation

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,620
those in the next two weeks tested me

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
and way is that I just frankly wasn't

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,040
prepared for

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,220
I was watching worldwide impacts and

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,430
death tolls mounting I was watching my

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,910
son struggle and every night all of this

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,270
screaming then my partner's grandmother

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,780
died so I've dealt with so many personal

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,030
crisis but this was at a level at which

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,240
I've never felt before

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,820
well some people talk about having an

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,250
anxiety disorder and it like enabling

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,900
them in this catastrophe is a superpower

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,090
for me it felt like wow all of my coping

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,790
strategies are gone I can't go and have

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,590
coffee with my friends and just talk and

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,580
let go I was feeling very overwhelmed

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,770
[Music]

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,780
working from home isn't new to me this

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,510
level of anxiety and lack of certainty

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,730
was beyond anything I've experienced

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,150
before I'm a developer advocate at

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,120
Microsoft supporting open source so my

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,530
job is essentially to constantly learn

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,950
connect with people across different

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,680
communities sometimes write code speak

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,300
write documentation and support the

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,390
community through building bridges into

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,410
companies how do I do any of that when

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,650
we are all faced with this onset of some

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,740
personal and global scale trauma

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,600
unprivileged I have a job I have solid

00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,800
management that have been thoughtful

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,920
through this whole period and

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,170
communicated next steps every part of

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,440
the path as we have progressed through

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,320
this disease I still struggled my

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,740
creative my creativity my purpose and

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,480
work my flow felt blocked today I want

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,670
to talk about my path to finding

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,609
meaningful work even in this time of

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,049
crisis and how community can support you

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,390
through building and strengthening your

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,530
relationships learning new skills and

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:31,590
contributing and meaningful ways

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,240
so prior to all of these events I had

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,780
started talking to Carolyn who is this

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,770
amazingly smart awesome engineer here at

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,259
Microsoft she has been involved in so

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,360
much different communities with an open

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,979
source and she is so well known for

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,560
creating welcoming and inclusive

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:53,580
communities she has this project called

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,620
Porter and Porter is this project to

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,539
help encapsulate all the different ways

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,840
that you might want to manage everything

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:04,860
it takes to install uninstall upgrade

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,340
and operate an application so

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:12,750
like hell more terraform Raz the azure

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,819
CLI or AWS or cute cuddle it includes

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,740
bash scripts or configuration files

00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,439
docker images all of these different

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,500
things so something that I'm very

00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,240
interested in so there are a lot of

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,419
projects out there right now that are

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,919
doing kovat related initiatives that can

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,840
help and support people those areas were

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,949
not something I could even consider

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,490
helping out the feelings even now are

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,610
just still raw so that wasn't an option

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,699
for me but I knew that Porter appealed

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,310
to me because it was solving one of

00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,960
these complex infrastructure challenges

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,779
that's often overlooked

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,879
it's eeling with the glue that between

00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,620
different components so rather than

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,650
dumping individuals into a project with

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,689
this long checklist of like step one set

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,539
the stalker container Oh even before

00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,250
that install this docker and then set

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,930
this container and then setup these

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,370
other pieces in your infrastructure

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,120
before you get to the point of

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,219
developing or installing code Porter

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,509
solves that you create a manifest and

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:23,699
get people going faster so there are two

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:26,190
primary community channels outside of

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,500
github issues for communication with the

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,270
team zoom and slack there's this

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,460
additional maintainer meeting to get

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,080
together and talk about what's next and

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,129
squash particular issues that have come

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,620
in so once I had my face needs met right

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,370
I've got security I've got a solid path

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,500
to getting food from my family my child

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,689
is feeling better not I was trying to

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,360
find the capacity to work again that

00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:54,750
motivation this weekly maintainer

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,460
meeting was so critical for me because

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,199
it was opportunity to connect with other

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:06,300
people doing the work but also

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:08,279
connecting with people during my first

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,839
bug squash I learned about the different

00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,930
labels that are used to qualify

00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,759
different issues that are raised I

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,819
really like the use of the different

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,230
emojis to signal not as the urgency but

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,850
also

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,460
sets the tone for the collaboration with

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,470
the team this is like a little hack that

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,420
he never even thought about and I mean

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,580
you could debate whether chocolate or

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,220
doughnuts or Pete's are more important

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,030
it was just a little bit of humanity

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,000
that I needed I was promoted from

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,130
community member to contributor being

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,930
recognized for my contributions of

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,360
providing feedback about the bugs and

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,190
helping to close some of them really

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,380
mattered to me in that moment

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,720
I felt like something was starting to

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,680
unblock me I felt just a little bit

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,040
better so I was determined to keep

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,190
contributing I wanted to I wanted to

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,810
continue to feel more normal if there

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,720
can be such a thing as feeling normal

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,520
right now Porter is written and go and

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,860
that's an opportunity for me to learn

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,990
though while also contributing open

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,460
source it's not something I already know

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,230
I started walking through the

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,500
contributing guide and discovered some

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,970
discrepancies in the process so with the

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,730
next maintainer is meaning when we were

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,650
reviewing the road map I asked to have

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:30,080
improved the new contributor experience

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,640
at it and now I have a project as I was

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,849
thinking about all of these different

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,700
pieces I realized that it's an alignment

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,530
with the five components that are often

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,740
recognized as being part of being happy

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,870
and work this freedom to choose what

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,510
you're working on being challenged

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,900
learning from your work having a

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,750
positive atmosphere to work in and

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,910
making meaningful contributions happy

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,460
might not be the right descriptor to use

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,130
right now but I do find that these same

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,890
qualities helped me bridge out of the

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,750
anxiety funnel I was in spending time

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,270
talking to awesome welcoming people

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,430
working on a project that I didn't

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,770
already know the ins and outs and the

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,350
language I don't know felt like this

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,390
achievable challenge I'm learning new

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,940
things regularly like last week I

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,800
learned that with Bill modules we don't

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,110
need import comments anymore so I can

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,560
eliminate some code rather than allowing

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,020
it to just stay in and suffer in this

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,639
repository so I'm making meaningful

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,800
contributions that help keep

00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,059
the open-source community has been doing

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,029
remote communication and collaboration

00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:44,180
so we're really well prepared for social

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,610
distancing research from dr. Nicole on

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,889
screen on github repositories shows that

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,259
other people must be recognizing this

00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:55,990
value of the positive feelings as well

00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:59,899
because Co contributions are thriving so

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,350
you can find your community your project

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:07,220
you can help the kovat projects you can

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,930
also find your areas of entrance if you

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,279
love puppies there might be a puppy

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,680
project that could use your help right

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,779
now if you're passionate about prutte

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,240
improving the infrastructure experience

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,990
maybe join me and Carolyn over it on

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,509
Porter find your people first then find

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,399
your project the Yun's book on forge

00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,290
your future with open source is an

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,759
excellent resource for finding a project

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,189
if you're completely new to open source

00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,559
or you can come hang out with me and the

00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:36,850
azure booth after this talk and we can

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,199
help find you a project to contribute to

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,689
but I want to encourage you to challenge

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:43,490
yourself and find projects that are

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,860
working in languages and tool sets that

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,860
you might not be familiar with your

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,189
contributions in design visual diagrams

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:57,679
support documentation and a myriad of

00:10:52,189 --> 00:11:00,800
other areas will be meaningful we're all

00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:04,160
suffering right now in different ways be

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,679
kind to yourself value what you can

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,199
contribute if you can contribute and

00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,410
bring kindness with your contributions

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:16,279
help nourish the positive environment of

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,990
open source community thank you so much

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,720
for your time and the opportunity to

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,269
share my story I hope you lean into the

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,240
available support from the open source

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,540
community if you want to check out our

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,600
Microsoft Azure booth and learn some new

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,970
skills there's also some documentation

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,040
here that I'd link to as again I've

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,199
mentioned before I'll be over in the
