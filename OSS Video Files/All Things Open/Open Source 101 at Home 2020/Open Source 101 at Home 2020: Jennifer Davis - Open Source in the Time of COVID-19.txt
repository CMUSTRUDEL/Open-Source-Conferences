Presented by: Jennifer Davis, Microsoft

Abstract: COVID-19 presents us with an unanticipated crisis that many of us are continuing to struggle with. While open-source often focuses on what you can do for the community, Jennifer is here to tell you it's okay to ask "what can the community do for me?" - whether you are a maintainer, a contributor, or a first-time open source participant.

In this talk, Jennifer will get personal about the struggle of work during a crisis and leveraging the community of open source to strengthen connections, learn new skills, and contribute in meaningful ways.
