Description: 
	Beyond Coding: The Hallmarks of a Great Open Source Engineer

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Dr. Shallon Brown, North Studio

Abstract: Being a software engineer with longevity means more than obtaining a degree or certificate and knowing how to code. Often engineers may excel at coding, but still struggle with their careers long-term due to a number of other factors that stifle their career potential. In addition, many engineers enter the workforce without knowledge of what interviewers are really looking for, what it will take to prosper as it relates to a successful project, and how to avoid burnout. In this talk we will cover how open source engineers can overcome these challenges and enjoy a long, successful career.

Dr. Shallon Elizabeth Brown, a 20 year veteran of the software industry, explores the nuances of being an exceptional open-source developer for this talk. This will especially apply to anyone who is newer to mid-level as an engineer, and is interested in learning what specific things they should do to avoid burnout and thrive within a software development environment. This is also for hiring managers who want to know what qualities to look out for when interviewing new candidates.

your next project or support so beyond

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,979
coding again the hallmarks of a great

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,070
open source engineer again thank you all

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,920
for attending I thought a lot about this

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,320
topic and did a lot of research before

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,659
diving in and and really presenting this

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,439
so here's the agenda first I'm going to

00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,820
give a little bit more of an

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,710
introduction about myself and my

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,439
background and then talk a bit with you

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,750
guys about the definition of great again

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,679
I think it's really important to put a

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,209
some type of firm definition because the

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,380
understanding of what great is is indeed

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,510
ambiguous and

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,550
something we should discuss so putting

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,710
just for the purposes of this talk some

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,470
barriers around what great is because

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,290
great is it can be quite a deep hole to

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,960
go down then we're going to talk about

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,910
kind of the basics of the expectation of

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,770
being a great open source engineer and

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,020
kind of the foundations for it what

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,210
typically your boss is looking for as I

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,460
say or what those of us that are in the

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,080
senior level work or that are in a more

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,090
executive position are now looking for

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,670
out of you so that you understand the

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,070
expectation I think that it's hard it

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,800
was harder for me when I got into my

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,120
career earlier to understand really what

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,470
my boss is looking for and I knew that

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,360
he or she would be looking for the

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,770
coding skills and delivering things on

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,210
time but I didn't know a lot more beyond

00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,340
that and there is so much more beyond

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,350
that so I want to touch on that I want

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,480
to touch on what they don't teach you in

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,070
school as some internet as well as some

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,540
interviewing skills that are specific

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,890
for our field I think there are some

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,900
specific things that are definitely

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,880
things that I want I think are important

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,130
for you all to know and this goes not

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,450
just for engineers I am NOT under any

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,840
assumption that everyone that will be

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,510
here at this talk is an engineer or is

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,430
someone that is even all that technical

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,170
but even for those that are a part of

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,000
this decision-making process that are

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,250
project managers that are organizational

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,840
leaders all of these are things that are

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,430
important for you to know because of

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,650
course this is your craft as well this

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,870
is what you do and I think these are

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,520
good things for you as well to hone in

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,810
on as far as finding talent that is

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,120
going to stick around that is going to

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,710
stay with you that is good at what they

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,600
do but also brings the organization

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,880
together which is another big key thing

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,220
how to play nice in the sandbox and what

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,650
that means as I touched on in in the

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,170
keynote panel that it really is gonna

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,570
boil down to your communication skills

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,980
but also networking and things like that

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,320
so I want to touch on that

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,470
the burnout factor and how to control it

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,690
and then just some key points of sage

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,390
wisdom as someone who's been at this for

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,850
about 20 years now and watching the

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,490
progression of the change specifically

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,400
in the open source community as it

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:20,040
relates to like things like content

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,540
management systems understanding kind of

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,210
what the sage wisdom is that I would

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,530
tell you as someone that heads again it

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,810
does have a doctorate and has been out

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,360
long that are things that I wish someone

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,220
have told me a long time ago and so

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
again thank you all for coming it means

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,850
the world to me just again it's this is

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,840
a real dream and I'm just so

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,840
appreciative of your time

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,590
okay so again a little background about

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,050
me I am chief technology officer at

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,240
North Studio I do have my doctorate and

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,040
information systems engineering the

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,620
title of my doctorate or I should say my

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,360
manuscript was motivation as an open

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,330
source a quantitative study in Drupal

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,669
and academia it was the first manuscript

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,669
at the time to ever be published on

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:05,790
Drupal in the world I was the first

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,790
african-american woman of our publishing

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,440
a paper published research paper on open

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,480
source at the time as well like I didn't

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,550
know that until I graduated they told me

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,919
right when I was doing thesis defense

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,430
but it was a pleasant surprise I did

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,930
graduate 4.0 GPA top of my class and I

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,050
was the youngest in my class at the time

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,240
to do it I've been in the industry for

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,190
about 20 years I feel like I've been

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,669
kind of a jack-of-all-trades but really

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,340
specializing in PHP flavored things for

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:38,669
the past 14 ish years I've done Drupal

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,740
since core 5 since round about 2007-2008

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,270
so I've been in the Drupal community a

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,460
very long time I've watched it go

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,740
through a lot of transition for those

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,050
that ask it is still blooming we do

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,520
still get quite a lot of business it is

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,080
definitely our primary business model

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,000
for where I've worked for a long time

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,350
yes there are is competition in the

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,390
industry and that will always be the

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,770
case moving forward our industry is

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,330
diversifying but there is no shortage of

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,310
availability of opportunities for a good

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,830
talented triple engineers out there as

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,169
well as wallboard WordPress full-stack

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,740
in general our shop happens to be more

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,210
of a reaction angular and there is heavy

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,620
competition or I should say heavy

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,600
discussion on the open market right now

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,390
as to which is necessarily better or

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,000
more sound but that is that is my

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,520
background in a nutshell I worked for

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,740
nonprofit and a large nonprofit for 8

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,780
and a half years I worked for a number

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,520
of very large-scale companies as well

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,229
that are in private sector in government

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,370
johns hopkins local university and

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:41,100
medical side Afiya BestBuy I've worked

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,420
for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,340
I work for a lot of local state

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,880
government implementations as well the

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,550
IRS I was one of their lead engineers

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,900
during their time of understanding how

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,670
they were going to progress more into

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,560
open source models as well for some of

00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,740
their systems and did a lot of the

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,350
architecting for that proffer for some

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,170
of their products internally so again

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,960
thank you okay so defining what is great

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,390
so in a nutshell I'm defining great as

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,000
number one first and foremost mastery of

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,820
craft you know mastering what it is you

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,610
do and really you know loving and having

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,380
a passion for it go hand in hand as well

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,930
as being well-versed in a variety of

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,150
what's going to encompass your fields a

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,030
thorough understanding of the history of

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,130
your craft is really super important

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,560
you've got to understand where you've

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,600
been as as a trade to understand where

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,580
you're going there's no way around that

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,380
the ability to code of course according

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,220
to the industry standards of your

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,570
specialization whatever that might be

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,030
understanding you know that it's it's

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,890
also scientific and semantics that

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,550
includes in our case repository

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:53,040
management you know having code sniffers

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,980
and code checkers in place you know

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,960
having robust having robust pipelines

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,510
that have a process of checking them all

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,790
of those things go without saying able

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,800
to mentor and lead and be articulate to

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,330
the non experts and that's not just what

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,890
other leading other developers but

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,760
helping your project managers and

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,130
leading them through the process

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,720
remember that a lot of times their job

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,300
by definition is not to be but so

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,400
technical and that's okay there is a

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,490
flavor for technical project managers so

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,080
there is a sharing entity to that but a

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,470
lot of times if you can get a really

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,140
good well-versed engineer that's got a

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,330
lot of seasoning and a lot of experience

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,500
and their proven track record of success

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,520
success but also manages to code well

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,890
that I mean and speak well speak

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,210
intelligently than that is often what

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,310
your PM's are looking for as to what

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,469
makes the difference between a developer

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,650
and a tech lead and or your met your

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,940
managers in general so an understanding

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,530
that there are really three major

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,050
business components here that we as

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,550
executives are looking for finance

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,529
so that's balancing budgets

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,000
Engineering so that is all that comes

00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,980
with you know the actual execution

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,940
implementation of the software and then

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,100
there's marketing and business

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,050
development side so that is you know

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,390
getting your company in front of other

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,070
organizations so that they can win new

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,560
deals get more business get more

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,630
projects to be working on and what have

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,760
you so that's kind of a definition of

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,800
great is the understanding and practice

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,420
within those those definitions

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,950
okay so flavors are great understanding

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,630
that you know you don't have to master

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,910
all of those elements to necessarily be

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,339
a great engineer or a great part of the

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,880
engineering process it is code stack

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,709
management it's it's operate a lifecycle

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,390
management it's coordination of those

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,399
technical resources somebody has got to

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,110
make a blueprint for the house and dole

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,130
that out to the other engineers in a way

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,690
that's succinct it is coordination of

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,910
you know proposals content writing on a

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,850
technical level and technical sales your

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,620
sales guy probably needs your help I've

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,600
always said that if you want the best

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,579
way to get some free doughnuts and

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
coffee easily is to make the friends

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,290
with your sales and business development

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,329
team because oftentimes if you go over

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,790
and say hey you need a paragraph or two

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,899
written for you I'd love to help you out

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,370
they want to be your best friend because

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,170
they know you you have the way to

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,029
describe this in a way they cannot and

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,890
that's important like it's important to

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,390
be able to have a description of what

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,709
you're doing for new prospects and to

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,300
get in front of new customers or even

00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,839
existing customers and explain that

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,190
intelligently architectural planning

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,829
technical deliverables somebody has to

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,600
write these things and be sure to

00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,450
present a plan of attack to your

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,250
customers and clients um times you do

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:38,230
have to just take your tech leaves on

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,930
site to be able to give them you know it

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:44,230
direct interaction clients and that's is

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,670
something that takes time even if you

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,920
wear an engineer you're somebody that's

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,120
more on the other side of things you

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
know learning to speak well and

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,420
intelligently about clients as to how

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,720
much information to give out but not too

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,420
much information how to you know make

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,579
them feel trusting with the bond of your

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,410
organization but not you know

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,690
overstepping your bounds this is all a

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,279
delicate dance and learning to do that

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,150
takes time and you will mess it up

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,010
sometime as you

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,570
we all do and that's a part of the

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,530
process but it's an important part of

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,720
the process to becoming great so what

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,640
your boss thinks great is all of the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,890
above it's all of those things so you

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,440
will find very quickly as you work your

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,060
way up on the totem pole that a lot of

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,580
what you will hear as you start to get

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,010
into management or in detect leadership

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,750
or whatever you want to call it more

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,370
about you know more kind of again the

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,690
bird's eye view of the organization and

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,510
less in the weeds at least to some

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,250
caliber your boss is gonna expect you to

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,140
do all that to get your hands there not

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,280
to be afraid to get your hands dirty to

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,690
not be afraid to give solid criticism to

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,190
your developers in a way that is

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,020
constructive that will help them get

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,820
better to bring your organization

00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,710
together and bridge those bonds to reach

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,210
out whenever you see something that you

00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,430
think that we can improve as an

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,110
organization they're gonna expect you to

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,430
reach out and start that talk because

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,830
they're not going to know they're not

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,850
necessarily technically versed and

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,160
they're going to look to you to do that

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,510
and to do that without prompting they're

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,420
going to look for you to be able to help

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,820
with RFPs and the sales and going on the

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,250
road to conferences and yes you know

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,720
eventually if you are hopefully you're

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,570
good at writing they love that because

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,910
then the technical writing that can pass

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,440
technical muster for for expansion

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,090
especially for government contracting

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,010
here in the United States as big as many

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,200
as you know and there's the Liberals

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,700
that have to be done you know they want

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,070
you to try to be able to do all of those

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,200
things and so you know as I mentioned on

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,670
my original keynote panel I have a

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,980
picture here of Gordon Ramsay and the

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,100
reason I have him here it's because I'm

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,810
a big reality TV junkie of his

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,990
specifically that which is you know my

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,000
trash TV that I like to watch but but

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,430
specifically because I've also watched a

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,950
lot of him behind the scenes and how he

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,750
got to the fame that he is and

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,540
understanding that what it takes to be a

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,250
Michelin star chef I think for those of

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,920
you that love to cook as I do because

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,020
I'm a big foodie you know and who love

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,150
food and appreciation for food and

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,720
passion for what you do you see a lot of

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,250
that there and I as well think that that

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,870
is something that goes without saying

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,760
for being great as well it is a passion

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,470
for what you do it's the one thing I

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,970
can't teach you I can't give you that I

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,750
can give you the tools I can give you

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,550
the licen

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,190
in the software and this and the

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,870
training but I cannot give you a passion

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,330
for what you do that comes from within

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,620
and so I think that what I would tell

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,080
all of you and encourage all of you to

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,050
do is to find your passion for you if it

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,210
is technical writing by all means you

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,980
know go for that if you find and maybe

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,320
your passion will switch over time and

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,910
that is totally okay and that's

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,380
something that no one told me growing up

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,910
that I wish or coming along in my career

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,280
I should say I wish that they did that

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,680
it's okay to do that it's okay to

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,440
experiment it is okay especially with

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,120
the kind of cultures that we have now

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,550
NIT especially with the burnout rate

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,890
with the turn and burn jumping around is

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,110
the new norm for better for worse and so

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,850
at the end of the day mastery of craft

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,290
you know again it's yeah there's you

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,970
know the marketing aspect there's you as

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,300
to who you put out in the world as far

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,130
as your resume or you know your what you

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,230
what people see of you on paper and then

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,000
there is the you under all of that

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,460
that's driving that you know as far as

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,260
the heart of that engine and you know at

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,960
the heart of that for Morgan Gordon

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,420
Ramsay it's just a really great

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,160
amazingly great world-class caliber chef

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,320
the kind of great that doesn't come

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,020
around often in this world and I think

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,339
that's the same for our field is that

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,620
you know and under that which driving

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,870
that it the late nights for the you know

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,670
the food that is on his menu that is you

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,230
can't find anywhere else you know that

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,700
he perfected and stayed in that kitchen

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,470
long nights got up at 6:00 in the

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,720
morning to start cooking cooked all day

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,940
long restaurant didn't closed down till

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,470
9:00 p.m. and then once they busted

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,360
everything down he's still got to

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,680
perfect the whole menu and he's got to

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,510
stay up until 3:00 in the morning and

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,400
then he's got to go home to his five or

00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,870
six kids he gets two hours of sleep and

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,120
then he's got to doing it all over again

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,670
passion is what's gonna get you there

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,140
nothing else not not the money it's not

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,700
going to be any of the promise of Korea

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,650
it's not going any of that it's it's in

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,380
here you have to love it and love it

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,480
really in here that is really the key to

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,310
great and that's really the heart of

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,820
what I will hope that you all take away

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:22,510
from this okay so this you know this

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,270
diagram that I created you know what I

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,209
want to kind of talk about is finding

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,089
you know complex solutions to complex

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,350
problems and address to address specific

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,860
set of needs that's the definition of

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,990
engineer

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,730
and for us in school or in training or

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,740
however you star date or certificates or

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,610
even just basic learning on the job you

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,570
know that's the definition of

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,980
engineering whether you're an

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,080
open-source engineer whether you're in

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,960
any kind of engineer that's that's where

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,760
it starts but you know you see here the

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,250
rest of what's in you know this this

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,600
bubble what your boss wants out of you

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,340
and what they don't teach you in schools

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,010
all these other things communication

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,600
skills and teach team interaction you've

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,070
got to be we have to be able to get

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,960
along with each other to a certain

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,270
degree there will always be friction in

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,610
a certain amount and that's normal to

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,560
its a certain personality types

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,410
but understanding being able to put that

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,850
to the side and get the job done is what

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,710
we're all looking for at the end of the

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,450
day setting good estimates on your

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,070
deliverables learning how to do that for

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,710
whatever your craft is is going to take

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,690
time and it's a skill to be learned as

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,230
well and it's something that you

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,270
definitely can get caught up in or trip

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,520
yourself up in and it's it's good to

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,160
learn how to pad to the point where it's

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,020
comfortable for you to expect some small

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,000
overage but not pad to the point that

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,890
your clients are gonna be like whoa that

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,090
is a lot of time it seems like for

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,040
whatever you're asking for right it's

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,590
that delicate dance client satisfaction

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,240
with the product even though you as an

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,710
engineer may or may not have direct

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
client interaction you are going to be

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,880
held responsible at least to some degree

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,160
to making them happy and so know that

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,140
that is the case yes now your project

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,120
manager in general cases is going to be

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,030
heavily the one that is responsible for

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,620
the client relationship and keeping the

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,990
project moving and that's a given in

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,310
those cases but for all their intents

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,500
and purposes the actual product we

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,540
deliver has to be quality right

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,280
avoiding burnout I will touch on that a

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,890
little bit more in a minute dedication

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,230
enthusiasm professionalism again putting

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,330
on everything else to the side and

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,610
getting it done leadership qualities

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,200
adherence to internal and industry

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,880
standards and deadlines and time

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,770
management all of those are the bigger

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,330
part of the equation and it can be

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,070
overwhelming it doesn't it feels to me

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,030
have felt to me like you know I got out

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,160
of school and I started to really

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,720
balance work and sometimes had two jobs

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,340
to balance a full-time job and a

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,080
part-time job going to school for my

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,850
master's degree by then or starting to

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,530
get back into that mode and you know

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,030
just feeling like you know pulled so

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,010
thin was lucky to get a couple hours

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,350
sleep at night and you know you feel

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,970
like you know I got to school

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,500
I loved coding like that's why I got in

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,120
it and now it's all of these other

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,020
things how did we get here

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,280
so talking about that a little bit so

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,480
how do you know that you're gonna get

00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
into this job you know you're out of

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,750
either and I keep saying school I

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,340
understand that you know understand that

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,780
I'm saying that he's no simply because

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,669
that's the road I took but I know a lot

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,950
of you come from other places and other

00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,230
careers or switch careers or didn't go

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,630
to school and that's okay I know some of

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,520
the best engineers I know have don't

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,710
don't have formal education and so I

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,570
applaud anyone in any way you choose to

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,850
do this but specifically about my path

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,250
and my understanding or I should say my

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,220
sage wisdom to you interviewing a job

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,780
hunting 101 so remember a couple of

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,850
things for me for you open-source

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,640
engineers particularly like myself and

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,830
many of you who your resumes are a

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,049
hodgepodge of all types of different

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,400
experiences and places by the time you

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,110
were in this for three to five years no

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
likelihood you've touched a lot of

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,590
different staff models you've touched a

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,830
lot of different open-source tools

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,179
you've touched a lot of different

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,150
methodologies as far as well agile

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,440
waterfall all of these things you've

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,330
experimented with different IDs and

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,429
setups you have gone through it all and

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,470
so your resume could easily start to get

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,270
very long which of course it can become

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,909
an issue earlier in your career

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,400
but understand that your interviewers

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,770
desk is a resume pile up right now if

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,559
you are applying to a position for

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,549
example at my company on average if I

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,380
keep it posting up for week to two weeks

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,840
I will get depending on the time of year

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,429
and the economy I will get anywhere from

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,440
between 75 to 200 resumes just from one

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,960
zip zip recruiter post or just from one

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,400
similar type of post online wherever

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,380
that may be so think of it that way now

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,960
obviously I as a CTO with all that I

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,760
have going on do not have the time to

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,100
pour over your resume and read every

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,679
word for any one of grannie apiece so

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,539
what do I do I have to look for what

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,520
stands out to me in the way of what I

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,610
can figure out about what did you do

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,620
exactly in short sentences in very

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,960
succinct terms and I think that's one

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,760
thing to just keep in mind is that think

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,280
of it however the other person is

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,840
processing this you I get you got 90

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,880
seconds of my time that's what you got

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,220
for better or for worse and that's the

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,070
norm and will be the norm and if I can't

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,380
glean from that easily okay yes he or

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,910
she did Drupal at their last job they

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,620
did it for five years there was a big

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,200
project here it looks like they did some

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,610
integrations they did repo management

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,030
they did this side at the other that's

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,980
it

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,420
okay yes looks like they have that they

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,400
have a couple years experience of that

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,800
they don't have everything I need but

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,240
they have the top two or three outside

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,250
that I need let's slate them for an

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,750
interview if you can't get my attention

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,300
that quickly it's not gonna happen for

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,830
you just not so understand that and

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,410
understand kind of that's where your

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,820
interviewer is coming from always taking

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,380
so yes even though and I say that to say

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,690
even though our industry as sach is not

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,340
fully saturated getting getting people

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,380
that are experienced for mid to senior

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,210
level jobs it's still quite a challenge

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,760
as a result because you get a resume

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,890
pile up and not we have a flush of entry

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,270
into the industry but you know the it

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,560
depends on where they are you have a lot

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,510
of junior level colors you have some

00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,030
mid-level coders good senior level

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,890
coders or rare good experienced c-level

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,030
executive level open source engineers

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,160
that have been at it for 20-some years

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,190
or extremely rare so kind of think of it

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,140
like that ask about the stack in detail

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,970
always take notes for any interviews

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,350
you're doing take notes because it's

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,420
going to start getting very confusing

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,160
about what they do what they're doing as

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,300
far as their different staff layouts and

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,280
if they have different stacks in

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,290
different places which is common I asked

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,960
about how open companies are for you to

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:28,400
learn some companies really are kind of

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:33,750
like we hired you for X job or p4x job

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:38,010
so but for some people it's also you

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:40,830
know it's a it's a concept in you know

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,110
getting into this as far as Florida as

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,510
as far as diversifying their portfolios

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,030
and moving engineers around in some

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,010
places is normal to kind of get them

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,170
more well-versed in other things so that

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,850
they can have longevity and that they

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,260
can sort of be in different types of

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,090
contracts and different types of stacks

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,470
and kind of grow up the company so

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,570
understand if what we're kind of

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,820
environment you're getting into look for

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,950
the right fit for you like I said some

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,540
for some people it is one big project

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,850
and that is just what they're good at

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,020
just focusing all their energy on that

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,190
letting them kind of go dark a little

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,330
not totally dark they still should

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,620
communicate about what they're doing but

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,960
just letting them focus all their energy

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,300
on one project and following through

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,610
that project and that's just how they do

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,530
their best work some people are like to

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,420
jump around and are best when they are

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,760
well occupied as far as just sheer

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,920
volume of work so find that mix and

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,110
match for you because there's no one

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,420
right or wrong it's what works for you

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,130
if you are not counter offering you are

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,920
selling yourself shorter than you think

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,240
I am amazed as someone who interviews

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,850
all the time

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,340
how many on average I would say 80% of

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,280
the people that I talk to you do not

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,890
counteroffer it is just startling

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,750
remember once they have gotten to the

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,790
point where they have said we want to

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,710
offer you the position and here is the

00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,900
money we want to talk about they already

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,540
know they want you so now is your chance

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,550
to kind of push you want to have enough

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,990
of a push back and even if they say you

00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,120
know well this is way out of the range

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,460
then you can still kind of counter back

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,950
on that but if you want at least saying

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,260
hey bump me up can we talk just a few

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,570
extra percentage you are doing yourself

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,030
a disservice because that lack of money

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,950
that you know piles up over the years so

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,780
that extra 5 to 10 grand that you didn't

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,960
get out of that last job translates into

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,910
then of course that also translates into

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,530
your next job and you're still that far

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,570
behind year after year after year and

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,610
catching up is harder even if you are

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,990
starting to counteroffer and that can

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,900
mean the difference over the course of

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,940
10 20 30 years of hundreds of thousands

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,860
of dollars even if we're just talking

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,360
about really negotiating the difference

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,370
between a couple of dollars an hour so

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,310
always always remember to counteroffer

00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,930
industry standard is 10% that is what we

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,280
are looking for above that tends to get

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,140
out of the way of the fold of what your

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,640
last position is I should say 10%

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,410
increase playing nice in the sandbox

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,970
okay so it is not at the end of the day

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,880
what you know but it is who you know and

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,710
and what I will tell you is that there's

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,540
a number of things that kind of you know

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,190
about that that I want to kind of talk

00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,430
about a little bit more as far as social

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,780
skills being paramount to craft mastery

00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,400
in our industry there is a four

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,020
stereotypes I am NOT a big fan of

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,120
stereotypes because I don't think they

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,430
serve anybody well at the same time I

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,410
can say based on experience that social

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,210
skills often and this

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,070
anecdotal but this is science it's stem

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,560
technology fields only science

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,120
technology engineering mathematics those

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,460
are fields that are mathematically based

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,710
in nature math always isn't and of

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,480
itself a science and anything you know

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,970
above that level or sorry that's gonna

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,710
involve heavy mathematics is a science

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,350
meaning that one plus one will always

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,970
equal two but those things are Sciences

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,680
people really are not you know even

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,780
psychology is a social science but it's

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,040
not really a science science and so I've

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,500
always believed that there's a natural

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,500
gravitation of energy towards that

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,690
concept of things always ringing out as

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,750
far as ones and zeros or one and one

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,730
always equaling two again but you know

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,520
just understand that at some point in

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,460
time the if your social skills are that

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,170
bad it will start to haunt you and in

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,600
ways you may not be able to or that ways

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,090
that you may not think about understand

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,310
that your boss is worst nightmare or

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,320
manager your nightmares are things like

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,060
I can't I'm not good at writing I've

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,430
never done that before I'm not good on

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,950
the phone I hear it all day long and

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,530
what it translates really into is that

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,020
out of a group of engineers there's a

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,760
very tiny sector that I can click things

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,160
on with very little fanfare without

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,500
having to kind of can't hold that

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,840
process the more I have to be involved

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,550
in the less I can be involved in other

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,670
more beneficial things to an

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,770
organization on a c-level like getting

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,480
more sales like being involved in those

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,130
big quarter million two million dollar

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,600
sales deal so that you can get more

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,130
hours as an employee and you can have a

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,570
stable job and you can pay your rent

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,100
those are things you want me as two

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,630
c-level executive to do right because

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,120
I'm your greatest cheerleader that's my

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,890
job is to push us forward and put your

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,380
your your great efforts out on display

00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:08,490
but if I'm hearing all of the reasons

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,990
and excuses for why you can't deliver on

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,090
more than just the coding then it's

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,590
gonna stifle you and that means someone

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,090
else has to do it I have to find that

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,920
someone else or that someone else has to

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,140
be me right it is a managerial like

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,910
nightmare and it will translate over

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,250
time into less opportunities and

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,200
therefore less money for you and so that

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,970
you know remember that you will be hurt

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,430
in this equation and your organization

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,590
so get out into the world and talk to

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,620
people and I say that you know just like

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,940
I love dogs I have a very noisy little

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,090
Sheltie that I

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,130
have they include nanny and you know

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,450
i-i've said similar to I love dogs

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,760
because I think dog psychology is

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,860
fascinating you learn a lot from it and

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,880
I think that just like at the groomer

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,260
what the groom will tell you is that

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,640
good skills at the groomer if you don't

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,410
want your dog to snap and bite it the

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,610
groomer and those bad behaviors you have

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,020
to train them at home and it starts

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,490
young or it starts when they're a puppy

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,070
or starts when they're just getting into

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,480
grooming you as the owner have to start

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,580
those two habits and then it translates

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,560
easily over for them the same for you

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,500
practice in your real world if you are

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,450
still sending text messages or talking

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,550
to people in your real life that would

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,500
text message speak I promise you you're

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,810
doing it at work too so the best way to

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,490
stop or to start really refining your

00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,680
writing refining your social skills all

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,240
of that is outside of just the saddle of

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,440
work you've got to do this and it's it's

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,970
going to be painful at times you're

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,550
gonna have big blow ups you're probably

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,200
going to fumble it and that's okay

00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,790
like don't be afraid to do that because

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,190
that is the way to get better at it

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,570
I wasn't always really socially great I

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,580
was very socially awkward when I was an

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,010
undergrad it took me a long time to bust

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,990
out and become really a lot better at it

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,670
and it was a lot of trial and error but

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,290
I realized that it's a skill like any

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,330
other skill be mastered just like my

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,830
engineering I I sat down yeah and said

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,420
you know what I'm gonna master this I'm

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,540
gonna do the practice the late nights

00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,130
the long hours the work ethic it didn't

00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,840
matter what other jobs I had going on I

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,760
come hell or high water was going to do

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,590
this you have to have that same drive it

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,660
for your social skills and don't let

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,580
anybody tell you can't and you're gonna

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,130
have to go there and the more you can

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,780
master that the more you can again have

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:11,080
more doors open and diversify your

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,470
portfolio it is the human bond as mr.

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,680
bacon

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,940
Jonah bacon was saying at you know it's

00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,310
the social skills that are going to bond

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,050
you remember at the end of the day your

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,760
colleagues and you get those references

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,200
for them before you really need them

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
again thinking about the turnover

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,860
equation sometimes turnover will be on

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,150
your terms sometimes it will not I will

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,760
tell you that the first cut is the

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,110
deepest and the first time you get laid

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,120
off or fired or whatever you want to

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,830
call it it hurts real bad and you will

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,150
remunerated on it for a long time you

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,920
want to think about what you did better

00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,330
or worse could have done better or how

00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,550
you got there but at the end of the day

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,800
you will hope you should put a period

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,540
and move on it is just a job at the end

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,740
of the day we try our best sometimes it

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,900
works out sometimes it doesn't but

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,390
getting references from your colleagues

00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,820
those phone

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,020
and contacts do it when the bond is

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,580
there and it's happy and it's bright

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,620
because you never know when the contract

00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,970
could just get cut by because no you

00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,190
know for all of you it could be the

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,480
whole organization of the organization a

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,740
part of that whole contract could get

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,840
cut you could all get lucky at the same

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,400
time having that info before you get

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,470
that message because when you get that

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,390
message that hey the gig is up shows

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,470
done you they're gonna cut off all your

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,000
access or not they're gonna cut off

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,530
slack they're gonna cut off your email

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
you you won't necessarily be able to

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:20,360
even easily contact those people again

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,190
for a while if ever so do it then meetup

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,740
comm is your friend and again the human

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,660
bond is the strongest I have people that

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,920
I still work with after 10 to 12 15

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,510
years that have been with me in the

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,690
Drupal industry back in Baltimore for

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,980
what happens to be my case we still work

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,130
together we still do projects together

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:41,000
and we have kept working together as a

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:43,730
combination of both our talent and our

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,860
prowess in the industry but also because

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,900
we work well together and we just

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,920
absolutely adore each other and you know

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,630
a lot of us have gotten really close

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,880
over the years we we go to each other's

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,800
weddings we go to each other's baby

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,290
showers and things like that and each

00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,810
other's graduations once you really form

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,190
those bonds they are hard to break and

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,210
they will see you through because those

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,560
are the people that you're gonna reach

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,020
out to when things get rough when the

00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,990
economy downturns as we are looking at

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,520
and all likelihood I think you to find

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,530
yeah you'll be faced ill be able to find

00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,300
work in art in our field but finding the

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,010
best work the work you want to do the

00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,840
work that is rewarding the work with

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,640
people you want to work with with the

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,430
frameworks you want to do it in with the

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,140
most longevity that takes networking and

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,360
or as far as to do it well so the

00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,700
burnout factor let's talk about it you

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,350
know I've experienced it and I do want

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,840
to talk about quickly the statistics a

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,700
bit 46 percent of all open source

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,130
projects will fail in the first year

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,780
that means that you know what the rest

00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,760
of whether you keep on a contract or not

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,300
you got about a one in two chance of

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,890
making this actually launch more than 31

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,210
percent of all web projects that are

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,940
started or cancelled before they make it

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,500
to launch companies are estimated are

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,540
estimated to invest now between 50 and

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,210
150 billion a year on failed web

00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,160
projects the tech industry as I noted as

00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,920
the highest turnover rate of any

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,970
business sector right now as of about

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,950
2017 13.2

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,390
even higher than retail higher than the

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,429
restaurant industry higher than food

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,690
industry and I found that startling when

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:11,190
I found that out but I did you know

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,799
quite found that statistic and quite a

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,409
number of places large IT companies like

00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,590
Google and Yahoo average tenure is now

00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:22,110
13 to 15 months tip not even barely a

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,460
year and but again that's my design you

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,960
know when I first started seeing Google

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,400
and I got out of school and especially

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,400
my Master's Derby by then Google was

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,230
really blown up and you know for me I

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,679
was so excited I was like yeah I'm gonna

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,780
be drinking beer all day long every

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,159
state board around gonna be playing

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,870
video games you know I'm a big video

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,299
game they're gonna love that gonna play

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,010
Red Dead Redemption too and then Final

00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,230
Fantasy freemake with my friends there

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,539
and I'm gonna code my awesome and then

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,950
you know I work for a big IT company

00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,950
like them I will not name the company

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,419
but and I realized that yeah there's

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,679
there's a reason why all those things

00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,970
are there yeah they're delicious they

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,130
have craft beer they give you free

00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,809
lunches during the whole last two weeks

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,700
of the quarter but you want to know why

00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,470
they do that because they don't want you

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,059
to leave they really don't like that's

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,890
and people don't believe no they really

00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,780
want they want to work at burnout pace

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,640
because what they want is the people

00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,250
that are newer to the field there aren't

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,620
overly opinionated yet that are have to

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,120
get a resume build going that have have

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,460
all these write ideas have great energy

00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,530
great Drive you know want to do it and

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,850
they will work you to the bone and they

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,830
know it's gonna be turnin burn because

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,510
they know these statistics they are more

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,610
interested in getting that right talent

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,710
than this the wisdom talent because the

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,860
wisdom talent also comes with big price

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,530
tags and knowledge of things like you

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,289
know some of their taboos like you know

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,240
really firm non-disclosure agreements or

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,440
really firm non-compete agreements those

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,390
are things that those of us that have

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,890
been around know are really ugly things

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,409
to deal with that can lead to lawsuits

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,150
all those types of things so they feed

00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:52,320
on you know those that have been having

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,360
been on the industry long that's the

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,460
best an untold secret in a recent survey

00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,900
hundred percent of 200 software

00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,640
engineers said that within the first

00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,169
five years of the with that have five

00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,299
plus years experienced it that they have

00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:07,500
experienced extreme burnout in their

00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:10,409
careers so yeah it's it's a real thing

00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,539
less than 25% of all coding jobs are

00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:14,970
when open source coding jobs are women

00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,659
and of those women less than 24 percent

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,210
will stay in the same field for life

00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:21,669
and so that basically means that less

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,739
than 7% of our industry is women that

00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,769
have will have been stayed well stay in

00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:28,359
their careers in IT in open source for

00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:30,369
the life of their career

00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,379
the number one reason given when they

00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:33,700
were in asked about why that was driving

00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:36,279
that is what's getting them out of those

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,229
fields is often the burnout factor it is

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,599
they often women feel about how their

00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:42,249
male co-workers treat them often related

00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,349
to social skills so you guys see how

00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:45,609
social skills at all is coming back to

00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:48,279
this and that's the number one reason

00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:50,049
cited sort of the talking down effect

00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,549
and you know the over speaking at

00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:53,679
meetings as far as talking over women

00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:56,979
and that's a real thing in our industry

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,799
so some sage wisdom now just before we

00:33:56,979 --> 00:34:01,779
get to to wrap these up and to Q&A you

00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:03,399
know this is just you know the hallmark

00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,119
again getting back to all of what makes

00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,859
you great

00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,109
open-source engineers so what makes you

00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,339
great for engineers and then I have

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:11,020
another slide about the actual

00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,510
organizations to what you can get out of

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,639
this turnover is high in our industry

00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,599
and you will very likely experience it

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,010
get prepared now if you aren't already

00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,299
understand for those of you that are all

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,250
of us are obviously in the in the

00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:26,109
pandemic and going through this and for

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,210
those of you that are getting out into

00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,559
the market now you know I understand

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,899
it's gonna be hard and it's gonna be

00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,899
even more challenging for you the best

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,760
thing I can tell you is to plan ahead

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,579
financially especially you know take a

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,079
look at things like unemployment there

00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,279
are people I've known that are even in

00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,859
our industry that can't get through to

00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:46,990
unemployment it's now been 10 weeks so

00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:48,609
don't you can't always bank on that you

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,169
can't always bank on getting you know

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:52,179
those public assistance grants and all

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:54,099
that stuff you can't we don't have that

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,419
flexibility you can't bank as you can

00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:58,299
see on even staying in the same job for

00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,619
a full year and so in knowing that you

00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,240
have got to take matters in your own

00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,400
hands and I think the key to that is

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,619
again get good tools if you can early on

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,970
get a solid MacBook for development I

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,440
definitely encourage you to do that or

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,000
whatever you tools that you want to use

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,130
if your windows that's fine but whatever

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,720
it is that you build reliably on just

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,700
those kinds of things get solid tools

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,260
that you can experience with good solid

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,270
warranties on them so that if you have

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,740
to go at freelance tile and maybe it's

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,450
not a full-time job it's a something

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,279
it's a part-time job it's just something

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,450
to keep the lights on by all means you

00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:27,990
can do that and you can acquire those

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,790
quickly on up work and things like that

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,950
try that you'll get with those methods

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:34,970
connect with your peers to find the most

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,290
stable environments to work but also

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,730
reliable tools reliable work it will

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,020
always come back to that I cannot tell

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,089
you how many times I've gone into

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,410
freelance positions that end up not

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,089
working out either for myself or for

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,369
other engineers there because their

00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:49,170
stacks were all over the place either

00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,820
the doctor environment or the doctor

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,339
version that they had was not compatible

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,810
with the nodejs version they had NPM was

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,480
failing all these really complicated

00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,700
things understand that you're walking

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,140
into that and so troubleshooting that is

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,480
also going to be a part of the game the

00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:07,589
better that you can get into whatever it

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,790
is either VMware or a solid Linux

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:10,740
environment whatever it is for you that

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,050
does that solid work by all means you

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,089
need to establish that now so your see

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,310
your local c-level executive has three

00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:19,109
minutes a day for you so I tell people

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,730
you know at my organization you know as

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:23,580
I said I mentioned I'm chief technology

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:27,089
at nor studio we are about a medium-size

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:29,280
web shop I we have on an average year we

00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:31,890
funnel on average anywhere between 85 to

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,710
100 clients our sorry projects I think

00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,050
about 85 to 100 clients of those we then

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,589
usually get over 150 individual projects

00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,060
out of them so my job is also to try and

00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,680
keep everything stable right to make

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,240
sure our clients are happy to make sure

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,950
the engineers are following through on

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,660
delivering the functionality that we

00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,790
need to our clients making sure we're

00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,410
delivering quality work checking behind

00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,900
them periodically making sure our stacks

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,960
are stable making sure that I jump on

00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,830
any fires mitigating those fires any of

00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,099
those types of things so basically

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:04,890
trying to keep everyone happy at once so

00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:07,470
you know if I have 50 engineers and 100

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,849
clients at any let's say at any given

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,450
point in time fifty percent of those are

00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:15,570
active so 50 projects 50 engineers I've

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,730
got 10 management team members I've got

00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,010
a whole bunch of things topping on slack

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,740
I've got sales calls I've got our key

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,440
proposals so let's say 20 hours a week

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,230
of my job is internal work like sales or

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,240
you know those types of things if I 20

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,700
hours of my week is then developers then

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,820
dedicated to projects then on average

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,780
let's say ok 50 projects week divided by

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,750
20 hours a week that gives me roughly 15

00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,150
minutes a week per for Klein

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,270
I'm sorry about you know 50 hours 20

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,670
minutes sorry 20 hours 50 projects that

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,340
brings us to what roughly 15 20 minutes

00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,619
per project per week amortize over the

00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,660
course of five day work week that comes

00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,220
to three minutes a day so you got three

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,930
minutes a day of my time that's what you

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,180
got that's sea level executive thinking

00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,500
once you get here you have got to get

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,180
you get your head out of the weeds and

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,220
it becomes a lot more about the big

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,740
picture so understand that it took me a

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,600
long time to understand how my c-level

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,070
executives thought and I at first I

00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,060
thought they were just being you know I

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,530
was younger I thought it was a

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,990
snootiness it's not it's that we are

00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,330
pulled very thin and that we it's not

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,410
like I always say it's a different world

00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,130
our world is different than

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:28,170
working-level world because it is

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,760
adjusting the framework in the knobs in

00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,650
certain places and then watching it

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,750
propagate out adjusting the knobs

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,700
watching it propagate out it's less I

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,440
started task I finish the task

00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,570
that's it I started task I finished task

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,010
that's it that's a part of it but we're

00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,480
not like that it's not like I pull a

00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,369
ticket I get that ticket done that's it

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,440
it's done if there's always three

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:47,940
thousand things I could be doing I won't

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,619
get to all of them where do I put my

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,359
energy that is gonna make the most

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,770
difference in my organization so

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,109
understand that's how they think and

00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,150
plan accordingly you want to think about

00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:59,010
freelancing I can't I don't want to stop

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,900
you I actually think that for a lot of

00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,190
people it's a great option do your

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,500
homework first know what you're getting

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,840
into read books about it get a lawyer

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,640
verified contract you will instantly

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,780
become the project manager the

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,090
accountant and the collections

00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,619
department all at the same time I did

00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,880
start my own freelance business five or

00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,310
six years ago and learned that the hard

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,470
way I if you want to learn I've been

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,119
working from home for over 10 years we

00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,280
do have a blog on your studio under our

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,880
blog section about it I encourage you to

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,070
look at it as well it's all about you

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,710
know good six key lessons for working

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,930
from home but you're a contract lawyer

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,340
verified people will stiff you over the

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,630
years I promise you you will get to

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,010
someone who will not pay out it was

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,800
something I had to work hard I could not

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,450
believe how many people it was like I

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,940
did the work and then they wouldn't pay

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,890
I'm so get a lawyer verify that contract

00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,570
get those things in place so that if

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,760
they don't pay out there are penalties

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,410
that you already established that they

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,640
get it set time frame take them if

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,810
they're if you have to go to court which

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,910
may very well avenge

00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,250
happen understand that that may be a

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,600
part of the equation so yeah she

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,070
freelancing usually comes with a higher

00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,690
price tag especially if you start your

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,280
own LLC but it also comes with a lot

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,960
more headaches a lot more weekend

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,570
working on a lot of cases or a

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,250
possibility of that so again just plan

00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,770
accordingly read up talk to your friends

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,130
that freelance learn about it over all

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,930
over overtime think about your long-term

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,520
goals and periodically adjust I

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,160
encourage people to document their life

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,260
and to take your to journal and that

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,300
includes for your career but just

00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,400
document and get a good handle on what

00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,870
you want and then readjust if you get to

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,130
a point where you say look Drupal just

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,750
isn't for me if that's what you're doing

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,610
I'm gonna go WordPress by all means

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,170
start to explore that don't be afraid to

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,630
go back to school or go back to training

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,570
I'm very big on I love code Academy I

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,610
love block Academy I love just YouTube

00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,620
videos I love Linda comm which is now

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,510
linked in Waring I believe I love all of

00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,370
those things there are no there's no one

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,500
right way to do it the benefit of course

00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,790
of these learning academies is that you

00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,110
can reach out when you get stuck and

00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,550
sometimes that's a vital thing and you

00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,620
will get stuck as you learn some stacks

00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,330
I found reactive even for all my years

00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,370
of experience on my coding languages

00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,290
reiax had quite a learning curve I was

00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,970
always great at JavaScript write HTML no

00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,060
problems with CSS no problems with sets

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,770
last all those things PHP reacts hard

00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,720
learning curve for me I'm still am I'm

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,490
still dotting into it I I'm great I'm

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,620
good at it but I still have you know I

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,300
still have a ways to go to be great at

00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,890
it and so I admit that it's a learning

00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,980
curve and I'm still learning in my spare

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,890
time so don't be afraid to do that at

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,590
the end of the day positive people doing

00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:30,720
great work again you know if you are a

00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,860
great engineer I have known some great

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,970
engineers that have gone on for years

00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,980
and years and they've done great

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,130
projects have great success have made

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,650
some great websites but the ones that we

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,390
hire back and for over and over the ones

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,370
that get the pick of the litter as the

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,740
projects they want the ones that we pull

00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:49,080
into as far as the professionals that do

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,210
the really a lot the a list team the

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,100
sniper team as we call them those are

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,290
the ones that we gravitate to because of

00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,910
their positive energy and because they

00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,740
bring things to the table that we can't

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,460
teach let's just which is positivity and

00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:05,280
a passion for what they do finally your

00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,750
organization for save sage wisdoms for

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,070
sage wisdom for organized organizations

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,430
your developers are the heart of your

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,680
engine

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,150
okay so please listen to them make them

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,849
always feel like they have a voice I

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:18,510
built that turnover a big part of it

00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:20,190
became a part of the norm when engineers

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,750
stopped having so much of a voice and it

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,609
became more about the product and the

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,670
client and the budget and all of these

00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:29,000
other needs that are more c-level CEO

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,650
executive banking needs which are valid

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,140
but it sort of drowned out the need for

00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,089
the engineer to have the time to meet

00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,680
these deadlines to give a quality

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,200
product I have been trying to test

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,000
appropriately to be able to say hey we

00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
got to pump the brakes here guys this is

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,329
not going to turn out well if we don't

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,819
add some more time in like having that

00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,890
voice you know don't be afraid to hear

00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:52,140
it and and have that hard conversation I

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,200
understand like doing the pros of cons

00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,730
about risk ahead of time or big turnout

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,250
if turnover is constantly training in

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,779
your organization we at North Studio do

00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,029
a lessons learned at the end of every

00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:04,920
single project what we did well what we

00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:06,720
didn't do well that then propagates back

00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,789
to our executive team we talked about it

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,380
without finger-pointing it's just it's

00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:12,000
an organizational view it is never one

00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,029
person that's gonna ever be responsible

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,490
for tanking a project in my opinion

00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:19,619
99.9% of the time I should say and so

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,940
have that outside intervention if even

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,720
after that you're having all this turn

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,910
and turn and burn

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,349
getting them by a source your HR does

00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,579
not count that does not mean your HR

00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
department should not be involved it

00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,270
just means that the function of Human

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,670
Resources is to defend the organization

00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:34,619
first and foremost against liability

00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,750
that is the number one goal the rest is

00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,789
all tangental and still valid as the

00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,880
people interaction but that is by

00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:43,680
definition not the unbiased so getting

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,390
outside consulting group give your devs

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,010
free training before you start I mean

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,349
think about it this way if you invest by

00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:51,230
you know two thousand dollars in a

00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:53,400
one-week training session for your devs

00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,779
understand that that gets you a month to

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,299
two months ahead of schedule on your

00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,680
project so don't be afraid to do that

00:43:57,299 --> 00:43:59,730
like well I am amazed at how many

00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,670
companies won't just make that

00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,049
investment and do it better to admit you

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,059
under bed than to go six month without

00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:09,299
tech leave remember good talented leads

00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,990
are hard to find and expensive so treat

00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:11,940
them with kindness

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,770
get creative pm's with your options if

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,210
you are running over budget money is not

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,180
should not be the only tool in your

00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,130
toolbox if it is you should diversify

00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,700
there are Google reviews there are Yelp

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,050
reviews there are

00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,880
being able to write professional

00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,320
references testimonials those are things

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,730
that clients can provide for you of

00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,680
value to your organization even if

00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,270
they're out of money so that's a way to

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,350
keep things on track without you know

00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,030
stressing everyone out as well

00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,510
temperature check your morale and

00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:38,770
honestly send out a survey monkey survey

00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,540
at least once a quarter to your

00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,730
organization to see how happy people are

00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,280
read the feedback and act on it

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:47,770
appropriately energy from the top always

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,540
echoes out and consistently delivering

00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,120
quality products needs nearly perfect

00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,130
process control remember it's at the

00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,420
heart of your organization if a lot of

00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,950
the people at the bottom all they get

00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,450
out of you if you are a manager is your

00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,700
energy at the end of the day you know

00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,720
hire you on Tilden poles so you want

00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,160
them to be calm

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,380
but you want them to do great work you

00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,360
want enthusiasm but you also want

00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,890
work/life balance and that message

00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,840
should be what echoes out positivity

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,670
echoing out is what will help hold you

00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,070
together even in the toughest times I

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,620
can speak from from experience from my

00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,240
organization as well I'm just to say

00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,250
that you know you can do it even a

00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,170
pandemic we have gotten through this

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,910
amazingly well and it I do think that

00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,860
it's because of the foundations we put

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,710
in place place okay so final slide

00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,390
before we take QA for those of you that

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,100
have questions go ahead and please write

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,980
those in the in the chat so I can jump

00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,960
right over but the conclusion code is

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,980
the foundation but communication is the

00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,510
true difference between good and great

00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,370
as I have said to just wrap everything

00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,590
up and bring it back to that point

00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:47,680
experience almost always Trump's

00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,230
training I don't say always but what you

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,250
bring to the table as far as sage

00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,410
experience is always gonna it's gonna

00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,060
generally be what catches my eye more

00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,340
than necessarily school so for those of

00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:00,400
you who you know aren't you know don't

00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,600
for academia is just not for you or two

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,590
to four years of school for whatever

00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,390
reason is not for you whether

00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,950
financially are the reasons that's okay

00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,350
you will have still have no problems

00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,600
getting a job if you can only start with

00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,950
some samples building your own portfolio

00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,920
from scratch and getting a junior level

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,780
coding job getting a good mentor find a

00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,160
mentor is key and you do that through

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,750
meetups and things like that find

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,730
somebody in your industry that will help

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,100
take you under their wing and that's

00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,350
also a big part of it master your social

00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,300
skills aim to acquire new stack related

00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,560
skills but I'd say at least on a

00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,480
moderate level about every two to three

00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,130
years if not more so by possible more

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,180
when you're just getting into it as you

00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,640
get out already

00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,079
to resume it's less vital because your

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,720
experience will build out on other

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,700
things but don't forget to keep up on on

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,099
your world whatever your specialization

00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,170
is learn from failures failures and take

00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:48,880
them to in stride you you can't have

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,770
success without failure along the way

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,900
all again look at the statistics it is

00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:55,029
inevitable and it won't just be you and

00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,410
them know when to seek greener pastures

00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,880
at the end of the day if you are

00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,859
stressed out all the time as I said

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,420
before every day can't be a fire an

00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,950
emergency if that's the environment

00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,839
you're in and after communicating with

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,950
those the powers that we as engineers if

00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:08,859
you're not finding that work-life

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,990
balance if everyday is a fire and it

00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,760
isn't just relegated to the production

00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,549
launches and things like that or

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,809
production failure if it's everyday and

00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,369
they're not getting you out of it your

00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:19,869
health and well-being as a human being

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,369
can't be replaced you can get another

00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,779
job you can't get another you and

00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,730
neither can the people in your life that

00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:26,289
really care about you so I would always

00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,240
say it comes back to you and your

00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:29,770
happiness don't be afraid to seek

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,109
greener pastures it's it's now

00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,339
industry-standard always talk to your

00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:36,760
management team first to try to mitigate

00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:39,130
but that's um so that's that's my

00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,730
conclusion so thank you guys now I'm

00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:44,650
gonna take a look at some questions here

00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:47,079
one person asked does the high turnover

00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,900
rate make it more acceptable to have a

00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,700
resume with lots of job movement I would

00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,410
tell you that the way that I do my

00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,970
resume because as you can imagine as

00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:59,230
I've said you know I've been around the

00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:02,339
block a lot myself is that I basically

00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:05,440
anything that I existed under my LLC I

00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:08,440
just put there as a as a footnote as far

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,170
as you know it's sbit solutions and then

00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,970
you know you know past or present

00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,339
clients and then I list you know the

00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,799
clients that I've had and just give a

00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:19,990
range for how long the LLC has been open

00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:22,089
that's how I prevent my resume from

00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,670
becoming kind of just you know jump

00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:26,980
around to go go I always then if people

00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,079
ask because I do break some of them out

00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,880
that kind of overlap with that time for

00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:32,920
specific reasons for example I once had

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,240
public trust security clearance and

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,529
that's something I break out even though

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,299
that was freelance cuz that's something

00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:39,279
interviewers need DC metro area of

00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,000
course want to know separate from just

00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:42,069
who I worked for

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,539
and so that's broken out so if they ask

00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,549
hey this looks like a lot of hoppin and

00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:46,070
I say yeah because I was working on my

00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:48,350
mass and

00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:51,830
my doctorate at the time and I needed

00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:53,900
the flexibility of being able to you

00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:56,120
know have a flexible schedule have a job

00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,310
that was going to allow me to work odd

00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,230
hours because otherwise I was gonna have

00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,790
every waking moment dedicated to school

00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,550
on my weekends I'd have no social life

00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,350
all my time would be work and school so

00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,820
you know that's how I explained it I

00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,500
think that having a good explanation for

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,880
it as well as just the most valid thing

00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,460
I have yet to get serious kick back

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,230
after that but yeah I do think

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,190
truncating it under an LLC can help you

00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,750
out there

00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,970
and that's part of why I encourage you

00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,350
other than just the tax reasons

00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,880
encourage you to start up an LLC or

00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:26,510
however you want to start up your own

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,580
small business can be helpful but yeah

00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,830
just it depends on what you're applying

00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,200
for as well I do think having at least

00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:35,540
in the beginning of your career a solid

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,060
two to three years in any one place is

00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,850
vital I do think that Monica or that old

00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,080
you know sort of sage wisdom that I've

00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,270
heard when I was coming up is still

00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,380
valid and after you get that two to

00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,970
three years under your belt of stability

00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,990
you can then build on that and say okay

00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,940
you know what I've proven that I can

00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,440
stay in one place for a while I've

00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,510
gotten some in the saddle time I've

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,370
learned about just the basics of working

00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,980
in a career oriented field as far as

00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,210
kind of the interpersonal stuff and you

00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,520
know what is to be a salaried employee

00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,500
and things like that but and then going

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,150
on to it's more feeling things so as

00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,630
long as you can kind of triage it within

00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:13,370
reason that it's valid okay so other

00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:14,360
questions one good way to I'm sorry how

00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:16,220
important do you think writing

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,770
documentation is for a junior engineer I

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,780
apologize I miss this I came later I

00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,280
think that you should start even on your

00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,410
junior level learning how to do this

00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,150
because it takes years to master as well

00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,010
writing takes years to master like

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,570
anything else I write at a doctoral

00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,820
level because I've been writing for

00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:33,740
since you know undergrad and then my

00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,960
masters and then my doctorate and then

00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,850
writing on the job as well a lot and so

00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,230
getting through that you know and I've

00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,850
gotten so good at it that's part of why

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:42,710
you know we get new contracts is that

00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,210
the RFPs we get you know it's it's that

00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,250
solid writing that gets them being able

00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,390
to speak intelligently about technical

00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,420
terms in a way that's going to come

00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,280
across succinctly so yes practice now

00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,260
the younger or earlier in your career

00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,330
you can practice the more time you have

00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,710
to get good at it and that's the real

00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,820
key is that how much time you want to

00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,420
put you know how much time you're going

00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,220
to have

00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,210
and you're gonna have more competition

00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,589
as you get in your career you're gonna

00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,569
have more people competing for those

00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,309
positions so the quicker you can get in

00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:07,640
it the better it can only I can't hurt

00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:09,589
you

00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:14,569
you know learning knowledge can never

00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:17,510
hurt you can only help you so yes and

00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:19,040
then do you have specific advice for

00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,059
open-source developers or people

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,619
interested in working with open

00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,500
communities in terms of job hunting

00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,960
resources people to get to know etc yes

00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,670
as I made note of is that meetups and

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,880
conferences are the best way to build

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:34,280
those bonds and and that I know I have I

00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,280
there is no in my opinion better way to

00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,049
connect with the people of your industry

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,520
because that the answer to your question

00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:42,200
is that that's always changing like

00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,240
every year there's gonna be a new

00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,680
someone or something like this you know

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,930
this year we were gonna myself was gonna

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,099
do obviously some big conferences and be

00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,569
on the road a lot more we're still

00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:52,549
planning some other big ones and all

00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:53,750
things open-source we also also want to

00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:56,359
definitely plan to make an appearance

00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,700
there we're still talking about that but

00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:00,619
yeah those are the ways to do it shaking

00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,880
those hands because the process

00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,200
organizations what I'll tell you guys

00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,210
and this isn't the truth of all

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,589
transparency is that a lot of times this

00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,000
is why we do these things I think people

00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:10,220
think that there's a monetary component

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,290
to this and sometimes there is for a

00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,880
lead generation but it's also really to

00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,230
talk to you all to talk to our industry

00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,030
to connect with you all what are you

00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,710
experiencing what do you think you know

00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,750
if you agree or disagree I want to hear

00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,280
that and you know it's okay to have

00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,839
those disagreements it's okay to have

00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,430
passionate disagreements you only learn

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:28,010
by those conversations and connecting

00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:29,839
but your local meetups are the word

00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,859
where to start because your local

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,510
meetups you can start doing

00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,980
presentations that's how I started I

00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,940
when I was involved Tamar just moved to

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,230
Reston Virginia

00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,380
for those that know the DC metro area

00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:41,329
about about almost a year ago now and

00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,339
but I was involved in over the past 18

00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:44,990
years again UMBC University on Baltimore

00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:47,240
campus was my alma mater

00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:49,040
um University Mellon Global Campus was

00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,109
my master's degree program so my

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,819
stomping grounds was Baltimore and

00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:53,869
that's where my Drupal circle was from

00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:55,220
that's where we all came up in the

00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:56,930
industry together and it wasn't just

00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,940
meet us meet us where we met a lot of

00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,500
them know conferences meeting up

00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,819
together hey you know so and so I know

00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,990
so and so we're going out for a beer

00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:04,700
after the conference you want to

00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,650
cocktail I mean that's how we started

00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,390
and then we just kept networking hey as

00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,980
you know job market got worse the great

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,940
recession that we had that was a hard

00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,589
time I was

00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,819
part of that that was when Drupal I was

00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:16,010
really getting first getting into Drupal

00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:19,430
but my first Drupal intranet during that

00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:21,319
downturn 2007-2008 and we got each other

00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,460
through it again the job market and the

00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:23,720
recruiters and all that may or may not

00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,230
get you through it but the people you

00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,849
know as far as hey Kristin I'm more on

00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,869
work you know anybody you're the graphic

00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:34,130
designer you know anybody that's looking

00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:36,109
for a dev and she says yeah that's how

00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,579
you make those connections and you learn

00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:39,020
from from those those types of

00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:42,109
connections and she's gone on and I'll

00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,790
become one of the top folds back I'm

00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,579
sorry one of the top graphic designers

00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:49,700
in North America so you know that's

00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:59,780
that's how you do it okay other

00:53:49,700 --> 00:54:01,520
questions I don't see any other

00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,380
questions I'll go you guys need to write

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,349
any more in if you have them

00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,690
otherwise I will just talk a little bit

00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:10,720
more about just I guess a few other key

00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:13,160
points from an organizational standpoint

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,829
you know and just sort of I guess again

00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,740
sage wisdom for any of you that wants to

00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:20,569
get more information on this stuff we do

00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,130
I do have we are writing a blog have

00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:24,200
written a blog series at North Studio

00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,480
specifically about open source and how

00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,819
we're getting through the pandemic as an

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,150
open source source shop talking about

00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:34,430
how we are networking with our engineers

00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,530
to put things in place to ensure that we

00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:38,810
are both financially sound as well as

00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,089
stable as an organization for them as

00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:43,099
far as their sake in the contracts that

00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:45,650
we use and you are the contracts that we

00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:49,190
paint bandwidth but we have been

00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:52,339
fortunately you know I've had a great

00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:56,000
team we have stayed stable we have not

00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:59,240
had turnover and either in clients and

00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,310
and or engineering and it's been a real

00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,020
blessing and I think that what I've

00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,270
learned from this is that it can be done

00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,800
and again I encourage if you guys want

00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:10,130
to talk about more about how it can be

00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:12,170
done or how we do it specifically or how

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,520
we have you know really kind of gotten

00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,069
ourselves to a place where we've gotten

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,750
to a sorry gotten stable projects

00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:21,020
reliably out the door that stay within

00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:22,760
budget that use great talent reliably I

talk I'm happy to I love to mentor I

00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,990
love to just talk to organizations about

00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,670
what they're doing in their world how we

00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:55,820
can help them as an open source shop

00:55:52,670 --> 00:56:00,290
even with as more people are progressing

00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:01,640
to you know looking at open source as

00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,140
the way of the future looking to get

00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,060
away from proprietary licenses

00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,800
understanding now that the progression

00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,410
to online work as many of us have been

00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,420
more and more forced to engage in has

00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:13,040
gotten people into thinking about

00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,599
working from home those even the most

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,849
stubborn of organizations that were very

00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,740
much an in person model understanding

00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:21,890
that you know tools like we use like

00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:24,380
slack and Google Drive and you know all

00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,670
of those types of things a zoom and all

00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,640
of that like how to get people

00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:31,270
coordinated for remote desktop support

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,619
more you know how much is too much

00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,420
communication some communication

00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:37,040
etiquette if you are refusing all of

00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,200
those are any of your organization wants

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,430
to know hey Alan where do we start even

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,230
thinking about open source where do we

00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,000
even start with thinking how to approach

00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:46,790
these projects whether large or small I

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,410
