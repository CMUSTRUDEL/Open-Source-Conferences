	A11y-Friendly Documentation

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Carolyn Stransky, Meeshkan

Abstract: Accessibility (a11y) has been finding its stride in the web development community — and it’s not hard to figure out why. According to the World Health Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need an assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open-source projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking these people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their developer workflows. And it often ends there, at the product. Documentation is left out of the conversation.

If documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and comprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After all, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone — regardless of the technology they use to read it.

In this talk, we’ll look at how assistive technology consumes documentation and cover some points to consider when building out your docs. Along the way, we’ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive writing practices.

[Music]

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,940
so yeah my name is Carolyn and I'm a

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,710
software developer and Mozilla tech

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,869
speaker based in Berlin Germany I'm

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,270
currently working as an open source

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,789
engineer at a machine learning startup

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,980
called Myshkin and part of my job there

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,369
is to maintain the documentation for our

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,289
products alternating between front-end

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,480
development and technical writing tasks

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,550
I've learned many ways that

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,730
accessibility principles can benefit

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,480
documentation and that's what I want to

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,170
share with you today so during the next

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,170
30 35 I don't even know 40 minutes I'm

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,170
going to throw a lot of resources at you

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,629
so I've included the link to and it has

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,660
a list of every article or tool that

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,640
I'll reference and that's also where my

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,940
slides are if you want to follow along

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,150
and I'll also show this again at the end

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,580
of the presentation alright so let's get

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,380
started looking at this first slide I

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,229
know what some of you might be thinking

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,409
like what the heck is a double one why

00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,750
a11y

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,600
or really whatever is on the screen

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,130
right now so this is pronounces Ali and

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,369
you might be familiar with it if you've

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,650
ever heard of i18n because they're both

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:31,200
alphanumeric acronyms this means that

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,670
the letter between the letters between

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,090
the first and the last have been

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,150
replaced by a number representing the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,090
number of missing letters this a 1 1 Y

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,950
format is popularly used across the web

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,950
to discuss accessibility

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,630
it's a hashtag on Twitter a category on

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,270
the practical dev and there's a

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,399
community driven initiative called the

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,009
Ali project whose goal is to help

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,759
developers make their websites and

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,500
applications more accessible so now that

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,090
acronyms are out of the way let's talk

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,340
about what accessibility actually is so

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,319
Laura callback outlines as well in her

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,629
book titled accessibility for everyone

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,890
she defines accessibility in the

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,960
physical world

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,160
as the degree to which an environment is

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,020
usable by as many people as possible and

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,140
web accessibility is the degree to which

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,240
websites are usable we can think of both

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,480
kinds of accessibility as forms of

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,370
inclusion this concept of inclusion has

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,860
been finding its stride in the web

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,190
development community and it's not that

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,780
difficult to figure out why according to

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,540
the World Health Organization there are

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,480
over 1 billion people globally who need

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,760
an assistive device and with statistics

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,489
like these organizations and open source

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,800
projects alike realized that they could

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:56,760
be unintentionally locking people out of

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,709
their products accessibility can play a

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,560
huge role in enhancing people's

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,650
experiences online but in order to have

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,239
our products be actually useful we need

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,380
to start understanding that people

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,100
access the web very differently as the

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,390
SIP technology is just one of those ways

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,430
one of the most talked-about forms of

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,440
assistive technology is a screen reader

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,070
this software takes the information

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,190
that's on the screen and turns out a

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,760
series like output audio signals or even

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,640
sometimes Braille so this is a now

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,530
outdated screenshot of a project that I

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,470
was working on with another Berlin based

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,480
developer Sarah Viera there aren't that

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,530
many components there's a search bar

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,140
heading text some links so let's see how

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,739
a screen reader would consume this page

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,450
and I will warn in advance that when I

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,730
did the tech check yesterday the audio

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,610
was really difficult to hear on the

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,030
other end so I'm aware and I'm gonna

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,130
make you watch it anyway and I'll

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,019
include so in the list of resources

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,690
there's also all of the videos that I

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,880
will play during this presentation also

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,410
if you're able to if you look in the

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,120
bottom left-hand corner of the screen

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,989
you'll see what the screen reader is

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,200
reading out loud so let's see how this

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,200
goes

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,930
cool so besides being great for catching

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,310
typos as you might have noticed screen

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,139
readers have now made this web page

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,259
accessible for those with visual

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,030
impairments another common form of

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,639
assistive technology is keyboard

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,310
navigation so this is when a person uses

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,430
only their keyboard to access a computer

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,169
or website screen readers are often but

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,130
not always paired with keyboard

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:08,410
navigation Shopify's developer portal is

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,930
a great example because it is fully

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,919
keyboard accessible and our focus as a

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,419
user follows the visual flow of the page

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,599
while this talk will focus mainly on

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,800
screen readers and keyboards

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:24,370
accessibility on the web isn't limited

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
to just that people have varying needs

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,910
and so we've created a diverse range of

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,070
tools to match those needs there's

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,349
navigation hardware which is generally

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,419
similar to a hand operated Mouse but

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:41,410
they might be operated with your mouth

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,659
or your feet or a touchscreen or switch

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,550
inputs with switch inputs the software

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,560
moves throughout options on the screen

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,840
and people trigger the switch when their

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,380
desire option desired option is

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,930
highlighted or trackers which rely on

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,720
cameras to analyze the movement of a

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,570
user's eyes or head and navigate the

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,099
screen or take action for them all of

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,010
these technologies can help a wider

00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:09,580
range of humans engage with and on the

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:12,460
web but they can only help people to a

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,490
certain extent so we need to think about

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,270
how we program our sites and optimize

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,370
for other success and fortunately for us

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,530
there's a strong business case for

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,820
accessibility

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,370
studies show that accessible websites

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,680
have better SEO and usability they

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,990
encourage positive coding practices and

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,360
help us comply with any legal

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:39,070
requirements regarding accessibility

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,020
online but the thing is while a lot of

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,150
people have realized this benefit for

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,729
their products it often ends there

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,940
documentation is left out of the

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,249
conversation and I don't know I would

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,649
say that's a big problem because if

00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:55,929
documentation is meant to serve as this

00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:58,239
tool for learning discovery

00:06:55,929 --> 00:07:00,189
comprehension in the case of open source

00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:03,069
a lot of onboarding and contributing

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:06,789
then it must be included in those

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,519
conversations one excuse that I hear

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:12,879
frequently is that quote documentation

00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,999
is for developers and this statement is

00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:20,019
problematic for a lot of reasons but

00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:22,509
let's start with one statistic the stack

00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:25,869
overflow developer survey from 2019

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,139
indicated that out of the nearly 90,000

00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:31,599
participants one out of every sixty-six

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:35,049
software developers indicated that they

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,360
are blind or hard of site and this will

00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:40,360
probably be the only time you see me

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,219
quote the Stack Overflow survey but if

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,499
we think about how narrow the

00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:47,829
participants that was in terms of like

00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:49,689
demographics um we can imagine that

00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,209
there are probably so many others out

00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,249
there who weren't accounted for people

00:07:52,209 --> 00:08:00,999
who are probably trying to read our

00:07:54,249 --> 00:08:03,579
documentation so take free code camp

00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:06,309
contributor Florian Byers he was born

00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:07,659
blind but he's able to code using a

00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:09,909
standard-issue laptop

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,489
he wrote a blog post where he explained

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,679
that inaccessible Docs and tutorials

00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:17,619
were his biggest pain point while

00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:19,539
learning he writes the tutorials were

00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:22,629
undoubtedly good but were completely

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,509
unreadable for me then goes on to

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,789
explain some of the details on like what

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,610
those documentation writers might have

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,279
missed and as I mentioned before I

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,000
understand that accessibility can be a

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,949
lot to think about but the reality is is

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,110
that most of us are already doing some

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:44,769
form of accessibility whether or not we

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,110
realize it so ensuring that the layout

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,800
of our page is logical and follows

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,389
standard conventions crafting user flows

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,269
and learning journeys to fit a variety

00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:58,660
of use cases providing content in

00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:01,720
multiple languages and testing that

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,460
content between Chrome Firefox Safari

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,260
mobile what-have-you

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,880
these are all considered forms of

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,529
accessibility so we need to make sure

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,870
that our products and the supporting

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,630
documentation are accessible to all

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,940
users including users with needs that

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,910
are different than our own and to put it

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,500
bluntly this is our responsibility as

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,170
the people who are writing the

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,500
documentation or building it oh sorry

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,410
it's our responsibility ruined my own

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
line okay but anyways so it's our

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,000
responsibility as the people who write

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,440
the documentation even if we are not the

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,140
ones coding it so Ann Gibson in access

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,180
independent accessibility consultant

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,399
puts this really well

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,010
she says we may or may not be

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,750
responsible for writing the HTML but if

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,270
the developers were working with don't

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,550
produce semantic structure then they're

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,220
not actually representing the structures

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,220
that we're building in our designs so

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,200
whether you are an engineer a technical

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,200
writer and information architect or

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,970
something in between you can have a hand

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,890
in making your Docs accessible so how

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,020
can we actually accomplish this

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,620
maybe I got you employed let's see how

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,140
we did it so let's start with structure

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,000
and hierarchy when you work as a

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,470
technical writer I used to be a

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,870
technical writer back in my previous

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,810
life typically the first thing you learn

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,940
is that well structured content is the

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,430
best foundation for great documentation

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,730
and the same can be said for

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,010
accessibility a good question to ask

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,260
could be would someone be able to scan

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,170
this quickly scan this document and

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,300
understand the material using

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,579
subheadings to differentiate sections or

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,540
breaking text into like short logical

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,430
chunks help sighted users sure but it

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,230
can also help those using screen readers

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,050
but then we need to ask ourselves

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,440
another question is the mark-up clean

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,260
and structured Laura call bagged

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,260
describes as well describes that

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,870
well-structured hTML is the secret

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,110
weapon quote-unquote of accessibility

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,780
and that's because when we write whilst

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,630
HTML without altering the default

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:30,860
behaviors our page becomes naturally

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:33,680
accessible take these examples so we can

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,590
use an h1 or heading one tag to describe

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,080
to the user what this page is about or a

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:42,320
nav tag to clearly indicate the start

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,120
and end of our navigation a side tags

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,980
can indicate that this content is

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,740
secondary to the main material like a

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,170
sidebar with additional links or

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,080
indicating whether we want a bulleted

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,900
list ul or a numbered list oh well and

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,750
fun fact screen readers will actually

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,700
read the numbers or say bullet at the

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,770
beginning of each list item sometimes

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,670
even if those have been removed or

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,680
hidden by CSS one way that we can

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,960
examine the page structure without even

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,020
diving into the code is by looking at

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,100
the unstyled view this is roughly the

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,700
way that it would be read by a screen

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,460
reader

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,770
from top to bottom and small tip if

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,500
you're using the Firefox browser you can

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:29,780
view the unstyled view by going to view

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:32,720
page style and then select no style we

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,030
can also support our HTML with Aria so

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
Aria is a web standard that is

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,380
particularly useful when it's combined

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,280
with screen readers to understand why

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,860
Aria is important we need to think about

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,080
custom components things like drag and

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,260
drop to upload content or progress bars

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,780
on video and audio they're great but

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,960
they're really far from that document

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,380
based behavior that browsers and markup

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,090
languages were originally designed for

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,170
they need a little extra help

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:08,300
so this is where Aria comes in there are

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,970
three main features defined in the Aria

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:17,210
spec rolls properties and attributes

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:20,300
Aria roles define what an element is or

00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,220
does roles are used as a layer on top of

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,610
the existing markup language for

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,560
elements that don't have implicit roles

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,950
the Aria role is also prioritized by the

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,910
browser over the HTML tag for example if

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,550
you have a

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,830
and you set the roll equal to status

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,620
then a screen reader will read out that

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:43,430
status that as a status rather than a

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,320
div are you properties to find the

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,950
properties of an element which can give

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,960
them extra meaning or semantics Aria

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,480
labeled by for instance allows you to

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,400
put an ID on an element and then

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,720
reference it as being the label for

00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,120
anything else that's on the page

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,340
including multiple elements which is

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:07,520
impossible using a standard label tag

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:10,940
and finally Aria states are special

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,460
properties that are that define the

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,890
current conditions of an element Aria

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,710
hidden is a nice example of this if an

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,500
element is only visible after some user

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,440
action like air like an error message

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,780
you can set the Aria hidden attribute to

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,210
true and then once that element is

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,850
presented you can set the Aria hidden

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,530
attribute to false states differ from

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,390
properties and that properties don't

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,660
change throughout the lifecycle of an

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,370
app whereas States can change and

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,970
generally are generally programmed

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,430
through JavaScript but there's a time

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,650
and place for Aria for example like you

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,200
wouldn't put the attribute like role

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,840
equals navigation on a nav tag because

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,540
it already has semantics meaning it

00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:02,450
should be placed on divs or spans or

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:05,510
other vague elements so next up those

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,700
big section ok all right so the next

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,190
section focus indicators so have you

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,680
ever noticed those like blue outlines

00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,100
that sometimes show up around links or

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,440
inputs or buttons those outlines are

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,230
called focus indicators browsers by

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,050
default use a CSS pseudo class to show

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,400
those outlines on elements when they're

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,350
selected and they might not be beautiful

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,440
but focus indicators let people know

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,000
which element has focus and helps them

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,680
understand where they are within your

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,260
site the elements that should be focused

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,900
about our links form fields widgets

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,570
buttons and menu items

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,490
you can design focus indicators that fit

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,980
the style of your site and go well with

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,840
your brand it's best to create a state

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,030
that is like highly visible and with

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,470
good contrast so that it stands out from

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,170
the rest of the content and that's why I

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,400
like this example from gov dot uk' it's

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,930
bright it's yellow you see it and when

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,030
you're testing your site you want to ask

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,260
yourself questions like can I tab

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,110
through this page without getting lost

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,800
do all of the focusable elements have

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:19,770
focused States can I tabs accordions

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,830
search results other dynamic elements

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:26,610
with just my keyboard and do I have a

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,650
skip navigation link so for those of you

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,940
thinking like huh what's a skip

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,400
navigation link well skip navigation

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,620
links it's it's way less like charming

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,970
to do this at a screen but I'm gonna go

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,400
with it so skip links are an internal

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,480
page link and are mainly used by screen

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,360
readers for bypassing or skipping over

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:54,120
repetitive web content web page content

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,370
so they're not usually visible on a web

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,030
page because sighted users can skip over

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,860
this information by scrolling past it to

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,770
show why skip links are necessary

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,520
let's take Twilio from 2000 I think the

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,380
screenshots from 2018 as an example so

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,180
the Twilio Doc's are generally very

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,800
accessible a good reference and they

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,950
look completely different from this

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,160
right now but you'll notice if we take

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:22,950
this example and we take away the link

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,770
style sheets there's a lot of menu

00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,930
elements there and it takes time to get

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,280
to the main content through a screen

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,650
reader adding skip links can help with

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,840
this and the MDM web Doc's are a nice

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,300
example they have three different skip

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:45,890
links skip to main content select

00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:48,870
language and skip to search images so

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,820
images can pose a problem because screen

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,090
readers aren't smart enough yet to

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,210
interpret graphics so we should provide

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,040
alternative text to help them out there

00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,810
are two ways that we can do this so we

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,630
can do that with

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:05,870
in the alt attribute of an image element

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:08,960
or within the context or surroundings of

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,610
the image itself and there are a lot of

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,610
resources out there to help you write

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,870
good alt text so I'll just show you one

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,580
interesting nuance that I've run into so

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,430
this is another size I say another

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,520
outdated screenshot of a site by Sarah

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,530
Viera it still works called is there

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,290
uber in which checks to see if there's

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,300
Buber in a particular City so you'll

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,840
notice the search by algo Lea at the

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,300
bottom and it's actually an image and at

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,790
the time it didn't have any alt text so

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,190
let's see how a screen reader would pick

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:56,450
this up and again I know the audio is an

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:58,430
issue it'll be available there so in

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,340
case you missed the hen this is what it

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:04,090
just read out and this is because as an

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,680
attempt to provide useful information

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,830
sometimes screen readers will read the

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,960
file name instead if there's no alt text

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,210
so we want to make sure that our images

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,700
are being named appropriately as the

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,100
backup at all times and if you're

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,440
tempted to go to Sarah's repo and make a

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,840
pull request to fix this don't worry

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,340
somebody already did they actually did

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,860
it after the first time I gave this talk

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,510
and it just reaffirmed that I think

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,310
open-source is a wonderful thing and we

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,080
can also enable the screen reader to

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,120
skip over images that are either

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,000
decoration or not necessary for

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,700
comprehension like the globe in the

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,560
example and we can do this by adding an

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:51,950
alt attribute but leaving the value

00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:54,500
blank charts and infographics so these

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,050
are invaluable to documentation because

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,230
they can present data in a clear and

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,030
visual way and providing text

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,700
alternatives to explain this visual

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,470
content it's usually the most

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,140
straightforward way to make these

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,360
accessible but we don't want to just

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,490
dump all of the words from an

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,650
infographic or

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:19,250
to a paragraph or spit out all of the

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:21,740
data from a graph when crafting alt text

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,559
for charts and infographics we can ask

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,270
ourselves these questions what are the

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
highlights and lowlights of the graph

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,429
and what are the most important and

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,320
notable parts I've also heard that it

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,960
can help to think about it as if you're

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,250
like explaining the contents or finding

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,130
- to someone over the phone so let's say

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,130
we have this bar chart it really could

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,020
be anything to be honest but let's just

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,780
say it's the number of iOS versus

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:54,080
androids downloads in our app has per

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,150
month we could write out every single

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,270
detail like this long paragraph

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:02,030
describes I'm sure this is technically

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,670
accessible but it's a little redundant

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,860
and I would guess that not all of this

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,559
information is necessary for the reader

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,100
to really gain content at contacts like

00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,960
we're hoping all we might care about is

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,400
that there was a significant drop in

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,290
downloads during the month of June and

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,690
once we know what we want to show we can

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:26,120
use that to inform our alt text so

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,270
saying something like the lowest amount

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,290
of downloads occurred in June with 27

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:36,650
iOS and 18 Android and now that we know

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:38,600
what our alt text would say we need to

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,960
best we need to find out the best way to

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,480
apply that to our charts at first you

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,580
might think like oh it's an image so

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,270
I'll use one of those alt tags that we

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,830
just talked about and this can work but

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,559
there's a more Universal way to approach

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,110
this more commonly charts will be

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,260
programmed as SVG's instead of proper

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,150
image tags and that means that even if

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,840
we put the roll

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:10,340
equal to image and an alt attribute it's

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:14,330
not truly valid so instead we can use in

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:17,480
Aria label which works on any tag or we

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,059
can even take it a step further and use

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,169
our Aria label as the title of the chart

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:26,980
and then add an accessible description

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:30,170
using the Aria described by property

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,570
accompanied by a description tag which

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,100
isn't rendered as part of the graphic

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,770
but can help people who are using

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,580
assistive technology understand more the

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:43,760
context of the chart another question

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,860
that we can ask is if someone is whether

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,310
or not if someone can't see colors is

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,620
the message still clear so elements with

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,070
more complex information like charts and

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:58,070
graphs are especially hard to read when

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,380
you only use colors to distinguish data

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,640
like in the example I'm showing I

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,110
literally can't tell the difference

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:09,680
between any of the greyscale ones um so

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,570
we want to use other visual aspects to

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,470
communicate information like maybe

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:17,510
shapes or labels or size and you can

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,940
also try incorporating patterns into

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,420
your fills to make them the differences

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,320
even more apparent well okay it's not

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,820
it's not exactly an infographic but

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,850
Trello is color blind mode can provide

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:36,740
really good inspiration for adding text

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:38,570
and patterns to your charts if you want

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,900
to check the contrast of something

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,640
really quickly I use color Oracle um it

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,560
allows you to greyscale your screen

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,140
pretty quickly and there are also

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,180
options for viewing your screen from the

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,230
perspective of different types of

00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,820
colorblindness if you're using text and

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,680
want to make sure that the contrast is

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,200
compliant with accessibility standards

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,480
you can use web Ames color contrast

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,020
checker in this screenshot I was

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,980
actually checking to make sure that the

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:13,760
the coloreds in this presentation are

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:15,100
accessible and if you're interested in

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,770
more information about creating

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,380
accessible SVG charts specifically with

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,900
things like dynamic data and skip links

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:29,270
i'd highly recommend sergey's talk from

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:32,480
inclusive design 24 event code snippets

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,000
so code snippets are very and

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,060
understandably common in documentation

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,640
and it's totally possible to make them

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,970
accessible to screen reader users we

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,679
just

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,340
to understand what they're expecting to

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:49,100
hear this is an example of an if block

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,980
in JavaScript according to a sighted

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:57,289
user so we're checking if X is equal to

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,909
true and then logging hello world but

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,730
this is how it would be read out by a

00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:05,480
screen reader some users might turn off

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,940
notifications for parentheses and

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,929
brackets or maybe substitute the term

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,150
like left brace for lease while it might

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:20,590
look verbose to those of us who have

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:25,309
sight it is accessible and to make our

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:27,799
what ooh I went the wrong way okay so to

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,679
make our code more accessible we can

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:33,740
follow our semantic HTML principles from

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,260
earlier and use a code tag and try to

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,929
have you also you also want to try to

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,390
avoid images and screenshots for code

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:44,360
snippets or at least images without alt

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:48,049
tags although to be honest I would avoid

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,000
images altogether because then if you

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:53,090
use an image you people can't copy and

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,750
paste to code examples and I think it's

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,150
nice when documentation is interactive

00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,950
we can also within the code itself we

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:06,020
can avoid variable names that have no

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:08,600
context like foo bar Baz and finally I

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,490
learned the hard way that it on some

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,980
screen readers if you have trailing

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,630
spaces it'll literally in your code

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:19,789
it'll literally read out like space

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:22,940
space space space space space so I'm

00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:25,130
having a real trouble with this so along

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,559
with our code snippets charts and other

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,840
interactive documentation elements we

00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,059
want to make sure that the words that

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,510
we're writing are readable and optimized

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,250
for comprehension so often what I see is

00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,280
that documentation will have these long

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,820
like verbose chunks of text filled with

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,260
bloated language and by this I mean

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,929
overly complicated prose that are

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,970
difficult to understand difficult for

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:51,919
anyone but maybe particularly for those

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,370
with a learning disability or who are

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:59,050
reading in a language that isn't there

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:02,230
of language so instead we want to choose

00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:04,360
our language intentionally and using

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,910
plain language is critical for more

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,600
inclusive documentation plain language

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:12,550
means that a document is short

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,090
straightforward and understandable on

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,160
the first read one tool that we can use

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,340
to make sure that our language isn't too

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,440
complicated is Hemingway editor here you

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,290
can paste your text and it'll highlight

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,720
problematic words and sentences for you

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,370
as well as offer suggestions it's

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,350
available in this web editor I think

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,070
there are also linters and integrations

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:39,160
for it it Flags mainly like long complex

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:41,260
sentences or unnecessary words or maybe

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,070
even words with simpler alternatives or

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:48,340
passive voice on the right hand side it

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,590
shows you a readability score and we

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,590
want to keep that down to a maximum of

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,130
grade 8 and don't worry about the

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:00,700
reading level being too low because as

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,950
the amazing Ashley Bischoff once said no

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,309
one has ever complained that something

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,530
was too easy to read and actually if you

00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,660
want more tangible examples of plain

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:14,910
language and writing I would check out

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:17,950
her talk from frontiers it is gold

00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,890
alright so now we have started

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,620
optimizing our components but how can we

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:27,550
actually test for accessibility on our

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:30,340
sites once you start getting into Alli

00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,860
and the accessibility scene and you'll

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,380
hear that hear or see the term whoa CAG

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,050
often and this stands for the web

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,390
content accessibility guidelines and

00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:44,080
they're internationally recognized

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:48,940
adopted standards produced by the w3c to

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:51,220
help us build a more accessible web any

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,280
of the topics that we discussed and much

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,740
more can be found in these guidelines so

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,990
you can always check against those but

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,660
there's a lot of information in Luke

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,730
Haag and it doesn't necessarily help it

00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,490
helps it's really great if you know

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,590
exactly what you're looking for but if

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,299
we're just trying to figure out

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,760
wrong with our specific website or

00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:16,409
application it can be a bit overwhelming

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,650
fortunately most assistive technologies

00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:21,150
are free or inexpensive and this is

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,309
great because it allows us to go

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,250
directly to the source and experience

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:28,919
the web in a similar way to that some of

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,220
our users might just in terms of screen

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,900
readers there are some options like

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,240
Apple products come with a screen reader

00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,059
built in called voiceover that's the one

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,190
that I used in my video examples you can

00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,919
access it if you're on a Mac by pressing

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,679
command f5 or I learned recent one with

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,350
a touch bar and you have to triple click

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:53,070
that little part where you put your

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:55,440
finger but if this is your first time

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,840
opening voiceover you can listen to the

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,360
QuickStart tutorial and it'll give you

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,559
an interactive tour of voiceover

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,590
navigation and interactive basics or

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,390
there's NVDA which is a free and open

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,880
source screen reader that you can use

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:15,390
for Windows whether you're using voice

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,039
over or NVDA or something else it's

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,669
important to recognize that the way you

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,200
a newbie uses a screen reader might be

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:26,480
different than the way a non sighted

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,640
person or an expert uses a screen reader

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,799
if learning a screen reader seems too

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,659
daunting or time-consuming at the moment

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,250
the developer tools on most modern

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,370
browsers have started implementing

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,890
accessibility tools a particularly

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:43,309
relevant example is the accessibility

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,679
inspector from the Firefox dev tools

00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:49,200
it's been available since Firefox 61 and

00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,770
once you enable it you'll have access to

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,539
a panel that outlines the accessibility

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,630
tree of the current page you're on as

00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:01,730
well as features like in accessibility

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:05,130
picker and highlighting of the UI items

00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:07,340
there are also many free extensions and

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,330
validators to help us automate

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:14,909
accessibility testing and scan for

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:17,399
errors in our site ax is an open source

00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,710
rules library for accessibility testing

00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,090
and it was designed to enable developers

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,660
to automate

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:27,720
ability testing on their own it lives in

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,390
the dev tools and when you analyze the

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,970
site it comes up with the issues the

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:37,920
number of occurrences the element that's

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:40,410
located in and even suggested fixes or

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,410
if you want something more visual wave

00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:46,470
is a web accessibility evaluation tool

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:49,200
developed by web a morgue the same folks

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,540
that did the color contrast checker it

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,670
provides visual feedback about the

00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,280
accessibility of your web content by

00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:02,520
injecting icons and indicators and tear

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:04,530
page so once we navigate to wave we it

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,910
highlights elements like in this case we

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:10,950
have our navigation we have headers

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,810
it'll show us that the all of our images

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,950
have alt tags which is great these are

00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,800
the slack Doc's I don't know why I'm

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,660
saying our and it can also show us when

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,460
we have potential issues like this is

00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,920
saying that our links might not have

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,870
might not make sense out of context so

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,510
the bottom line really if you take away

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,670
anything from this is that accessibility

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,560
should be a requirement and not a

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,940
nice-to-have

00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,510
but in order for this to happen we need

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,400
to think about how we can change

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:47,250
processes within our organizations or

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,200
open source teams or workflows so we can

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,960
create and implement an accessibility

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,540
policy an accessibility policy can be

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,300
anything from a formal document that's

00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,700
posted publicly to an internal set of

00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,110
standards that your team follows either

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,480
way it should be a statement that

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:07,830
outlines your organization's intentions

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,170
towards your products accessibility take

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:13,020
oracle for example oracle has a

00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,090
dedicated documentation accessibility

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,370
statement where it gives you warnings

00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,890
about what screen readers might get

00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,390
wrong as you're going through their dogs

00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,580
for instance it mentions that the

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,250
conventions for writing code require a

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,100
closing brace that should appear on an

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,290
otherwise empty line and they note that

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,430
some screen readers may not always read

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:38,660
a line of text that solely consists of

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:40,880
or braces again they don't have to be

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,470
made public but posting them publicly

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,260
shows your commitment to accessibility

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:49,220
and lets visitors know what they can

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,900
expect from your site many of the points

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,360
I mentioned can be added to your

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,640
development checklist that way you can

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,580
check accessibility errors before they

00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,690
are pushed to production and if you

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,880
don't know where to start

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,880
the Aly project has a pretty thorough

00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:09,409
one that you can use reference adapt for

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,060
your own project so we can also learn to

00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,480
browse the web from a different

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,520
perspective so give yourself like a goal

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,340
or a deadline like dedicate an entire

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,010
day to browsing your web using only the

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,169
keyboard spend an afternoon learning how

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,000
to navigate a screen reader turn your

00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:28,960
settings to grayscale for a week

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,490
learning how to use assistive technology

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,280
ourselves can help us build empathy

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,780
towards people with needs differing than

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,130
our own who might be trying to access

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,750
our website you can also host an

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,149
accessibility hackathon within your

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,970
organization or beyond for your open

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,580
source community there's a lot that can

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:52,610
be accomplished in just a few hours so

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:55,580
mdn actually did this back in September

00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,890
2018 and based on the blog post that

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,990
they published linked here on the slide

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:04,610
it worked out pretty well I'd say and

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,520
finally you can contribute to open

00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:10,190
source documentation and help make their

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,470
documentation accessible full disclosure

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,630
I added this slide after this coming to

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,000
the keynotes earlier but I really

00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,160
believe that it is a great way to get

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,160
both get involved with open source and

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,260
also to start thinking about and working

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,170
with these accessibility concepts in

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,810
documentation plus speaking as a

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,380
maintainer both accessibility and Docs

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:38,600
PRS are usually very welcome and the

00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:41,630
combinations come on even better alright

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,880
so again I've shared a lot with you past

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,890
30-something minutes and it's only

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,230
scraping the surface of what we can do

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:51,380
to integrate accessibility into our

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,880
but there's one thing that really stood

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,890
out to me during all of my research that

00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,380
I want to share with you today this is

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,510
for everyone is listed as one of the

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,590
design principles for the UK government

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:09,380
in it they say quote everything we build

00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:11,720
should be as inclusive legible and

00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,000
readable as possible if we have to

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,730
sacrifice elegance so be it

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,350
we're building for needs not audiences

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,020
we're designing for the whole country

00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:25,850
not just ones who are used to using the

00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:29,000
web and I believe that if we adopt a

00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:32,380
similar mindset that we can create

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:39,140
documentation that is truly for everyone

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:41,420
and thanks so ok I'll be hanging out in

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,550
the chat room for a while so if you have

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,860
any questions you can ask them there or

00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,470
tweet at me I figure that's a little bit

00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,010
easier than me trying to like babble

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:54,140
them on screen right now so there's also

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,880
to hear the link to the resources that I

00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:01,040
mentioned and I will also drop that in

00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,870
the chat and yeah that's it so I know

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,870
you all had a lot of choices for which

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:09,410
session you could attend and I'm very

00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:13,130
grateful that you chose mine and yeah I

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:16,730
hope you enjoy the rest of I'm really

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,800
read I just finally saw myself but okay

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,090
I hope you all enjoy the rest of the

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,090
