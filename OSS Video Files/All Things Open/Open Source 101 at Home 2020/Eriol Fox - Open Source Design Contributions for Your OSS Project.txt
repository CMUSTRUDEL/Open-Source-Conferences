	Open Source Design Contributions for Your OSS Project

Presented at: Open Source 101 at Home 2020
Presented by: Eriol Fox, Humanitarian Design

Abstract: This short workshop is aimed at getting OSS projects ready for design contributions.

You’ll have never asked for or set up issues ready for OSS designers.

Covering the best first issues to attract design contributions and the processes involved in building a ‘design wing’ of your OSS community.

Open Source design has a plethora of hurdles to leap before it could become fully adopted by the global design community. Exploitative ‘work for free attitudes’, workflows and how design functions/roles connect up through a product life cycle, how our software doesn’t yet allow for robust and collaborative versioning across different designers and how the open source community as a whole, is over represented by those with privilege, access and ability.

Ushahidi builds humanitarian tools, remotely for some of the most marginalised people across the globe. To tackle these systemic problems with how to ‘open source’ a design effort and bring the community along with the, ‘on-staff’ Ushahidi designers, we’ve been piloting a series of design jams on our crisis communication tool TenFour with our partners Designit and Adobe. Together, we’re looking to solve the problems with how open source design can work by engaging through meaningful technology that makes a difference in the world.

We’re here to take you through that journey and what we've learnt about design contributions to OSS.

[Music]

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,670
so what we're going to be doing on the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,350
extended session today is roughly this

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,140
agenda we're gonna see how much we get

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,400
through there's no pressure to get

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,020
through everything and what this is

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,109
really supposed to do is give you a

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,019
flavor of some of the things to get

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,140
started on for getting your open-source

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,180
project ready for design contributions

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,750
so you definitely will feel like some of

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,340
the the tasks within this extended

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,870
session you're gonna want more time to

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,760
work on them but I'm going to keep them

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,230
really short so that you get a flavor of

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,770
lots of different things that you can do

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,570
to get edgy right the tools that we're

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,579
using we're using hop in at the moment

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,010
we're going to be using something called

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,250
narrow for it's like a collaborative

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,649
work for it for all of us to use the

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,230
link is on the screen at the moment but

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,969
I also put it in the chat at the top so

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,060
you should be able to find that it does

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,820
not require you to log in in any way you

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,979
can collaborate anonymously but it does

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,409
help if you sign up for an account

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,820
because then you know I can see the name

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,689
of the cursor but if you don't want to

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,020
do that you absolutely do not have to

00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:24,900
we're going to test where they're using

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,790
gypsy rooms for group discussions works

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,960
when you're working on your tasks in

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,810
groups and obviously we've got some

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,909
github examples examples of open source

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,710
projects from github that we are going

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,159
to be looking at again don't need to get

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,990
hub account if you don't have one but

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,490
we're gonna be there's a few github

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,860
links to different projects that i've

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,710
offered as an example of ones that you

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,439
can work on during this session the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,210
other things that we can use as well

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,590
before I knew that there was a really

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,409
robust robust chat feature here I have a

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,060
open design channel that we can do you

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,850
could have use for communicating in

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,500
groups it's really up to you within your

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,310
groups whether you prefer using gypsy

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,319
gypsy search should hopefully work

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,150
reasonably well for the groups and the

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,830
discussions if you really do struggle

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,200
there is that full back to use that

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,770
slack but you will I will need to invite

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,410
you and add you on that and the last one

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,890
on this slide is I have a whereby room

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,470
that I have in the background I am

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,540
trying to use my whereby room which is

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,770
another video chat function that's used

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,290
in the browser and you don't need to

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,300
sign in or log in but I'm using that to

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,220
try and simulate that thing that happens

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,769
in workshops or in conferences where you

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,870
might want to come up to the you know

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,220
facilitator and ask them a question you

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,860
might not want the rest of the room to

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,780
hear so that room is there for that

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,550
specific reason that if somebody wanted

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,980
to approach me ask the question we'll

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,780
try and figure something out with me

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,910
then they can ask in that room and I

00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,290
could join your Jitsu room for your

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,140
group to try and help you through that

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,330
task so we're gonna see whether that

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:09,459
works maybe it will maybe it won't but

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,110
let's get me go right okay the agenda is

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,250
we're going to look at we're going to do

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,350
some introductions we're going to do a

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,100
little bit talking first we're going to

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,320
form some groups from the attendees here

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,840
then we're going to look the essential

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,930
design documentation and labels for your

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,370
repos your open source projects and then

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,040
we're going to look at something which

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,100
we call a design challenge versus an

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,370
issue which is created from an issue in

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,989
an open source feedback then we're going

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,720
to look at understanding design

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,459
activities we're going to talk briefly

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,320
about something called witnesses and

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,590
then we're going to finish which has to

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,730
be super sad because I missed talking to

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,560
everyone so when I was thinking about

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,060
how to construct this session I was

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,100
thinking about different things that I

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,170
could do to try and make this smoother

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,930
and make this work for everyone given

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,820
that this is a new format for all of us

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,640
reading well most of us I'm going to try

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,500
to remember these things one is to pause

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,180
for five seconds before moving on to the

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,440
next slide just in case anyone is

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,280
writing anything down taking screenshots

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,910
or maybe just you know wants to spend

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,080
longer reading what's on the street I'm

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,300
gonna pause for maybe up to ten seconds

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,580
if it contains a link that you need to

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:36,230
open and use for the tasks I'm gonna try

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,150
and read out and explain all the slides

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,690
content when working across different

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,520
windows and different screens I'm gonna

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,800
try and pay good attention to the chat

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,300
here on papi I'm going to try and add in

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,090
some extra comfort breaks even though

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,880
we've got scheduled breaks one hour 45

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,490
is quite a long time so I'm trying

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,910
workings and comfort rates but we will

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,090
have tasks sections within the extended

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,700
session where as always your group are

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,780
happy you can you know go for a bathroom

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,640
break grab some water

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,460
do whatever you need to do in those in

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,710
those times I've made the slides

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,750
available on a drive link so if anything

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,070
goes wrong your internet goes down you

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,250
want to catch up you want to read up

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,570
that should be available for you and

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,669
then if you have any other suggestions

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,880
like making sure I'm not covering the

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,250
mic from my laptop as I'm trying to talk

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,140
then please add them into the chat and

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:41,020
I'm trying to associate them as their

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:43,250
second so we're gonna be quite

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,690
collaborative within this session it's

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:52,240
gonna be hopefully really fun if you'd

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:55,700
like to open this link on your computers

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,250
it's gonna maybe be challenging for some

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,110
people I don't know what everyone's

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,260
setup is like multiple tabs might get

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,970
quite hard to manage but please bear

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:10,490
with me and try try and open up this

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:14,360
link on your machines it's in the top of

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,910
the chat if you want to just click a

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,729
link and have it open and I'm just gonna

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:26,710
move to my tab to see whether people are

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,710
joining cool I've got four people

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,710
so what you should see is a boards a

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,750
sort of browser-based kind of work board

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,850
with a lot of different stuff on it sand

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,300
colored boxes and text and things like

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,250
that this is a tool called mirror there

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,750
are a few tools like it I'm sorry it's

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,270
not open source but like um but what you

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,970
can do is you can zoom out and you can

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,080
zoom in and we're going to be working

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,919
through each of these sections

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,680
throughout this this session so you're

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,900
gonna want to stay keep that tap or that

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:14,610
window open as we as we go through the

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:16,710
session okay so the first thing that

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,220
we're gonna do in the board that we've

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,620
got is we are going to go to the section

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,440
where we're going to write down our

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,650
names and we're going to do this kind of

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,750
icebreaker which is so if you go to the

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:35,699
names and skills section and I'm just

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:50,909
going to show you where that is on my

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:53,789
screen as well to raiments well I what's

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:57,169
the way when you test things before they

00:07:53,789 --> 00:08:00,570
work perfectly fine and then when you

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,720
when you try them again things get a

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:07,289
little bit harder here we go so we want

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,490
to be in the section that says names and

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:15,990
skills and we're gonna want to add in

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,750
our name in the text section here in the

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,919
section with pink you're gonna want to

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,080
write a skill that you're comfortable

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,630
with something that you do every day

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,479
almost something related to open source

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,650
if you did you come then we've got a

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,990
skill you'd like to share with another

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,990
person so it could be the same skill

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,830
that you're comfortable with um or it

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,510
could be something else

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,849
that you also enjoy doing and you'd love

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,130
to share it with another person and then

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,150
we've got a section which is a silly

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,710
like to learn

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,420
more about so maybe it's something that

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,560
you don't do enough of already or

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,440
something that you've always wanted to

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,630
learn so you can see my examples here I

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,020
feel uncomfortable with who's UX design

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,750
I would love to share with other people

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,390
how to work with brands to build user

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,220
interfaces yeah how to use a brand and

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,200
build user interfaces from that and

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,990
something I always want to learn more

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:14,160
about is DevOps if you can and then the

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,730
last section that we've got here is if

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,230
you want to add in a open source project

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,040
a link to an open source project that

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:27,060
you either maintain own or work on at

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,880
the moment so I mean give some time for

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,880
the room to work on that

00:09:47,310 --> 00:10:01,029
no worries right don't worry

00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:02,850
so if I reshare my about my rosette just

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:09,580
a second

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:12,670
okay here we go so you if you zoom all

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,170
the way out on this tab here you'll see

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,180
that there's lots and lots of things in

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,730
it and if you find the section which

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:28,390
those names and skills ah cool awesome

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:33,070
glad you got it and the way that you can

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:36,820
edit the text you either use the text

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,089
tool in the sidebar or you can double

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,920
click on the existing text here and

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,070
change change the sample text I'll go in

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,070
there

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,270
it'll take some while to get used to

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,350
something new like those so if you

00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,589
haven't used these kinds of things

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,350
before but this is actually a tool quite

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:06,040
a few designers are now using to try and

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,620
do online versions of the things that

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,330
they often do in person using lots and

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,209
lots of post-it notes now they're using

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:19,270
virtual poster notes so I'm going to

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,779
give us another two minutes to fill

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,779
these things out

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,170
and I'm noticing we've got around 12

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,590
people in the room at the moment which

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,510
seems like it might be to two groups of

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,880
people at the moment so I wasn't quite

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,420
sure how many people we get it looks

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,170
like we've got two two groups at the

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,000
moment roughly but we'll see we'll see

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:58,860
who adds their name what's on on the

00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:02,360
marry board okay so we've got one two

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,360
three and one two

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,050
am i pushing you out of your comfort

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,760
Singh's already with with using Mary

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,140
you're already doing design work so

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,220
whoever whoever hasn't done this kind of

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,180
stuff before I I heard that is as

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,180
interesting as it is frustrating

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,800
hmm

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,730
so I'm just reading reading some of the

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,260
things that you you all have put in here

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:12,100
we've got we've got one other person

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,890
that's into user experience design we've

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,650
got a few coders and software developers

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,890
and programming but some people that do

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:23,920
you want to share usability testing

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:28,380
people are gonna absolutely jump on that

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,380
opportunity for that Skillshare ABI

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:47,950
excellent good stuff okay and we've got

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,980
one project in there which is the open

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:57,490
design project things cool and all we've

00:13:50,980 --> 00:14:00,250
got open sourced as a project Jim I kind

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,870
of expect you to by the statement I

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,270
surely do there might be not enough

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,190
space within this within this section

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,320
for maybe all the projects that you

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:16,420
contribute to so that might be a

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:18,370
limitation so okay so I'm gonna I'm

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,940
gonna say that we've got the people that

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,160
are participating in this anyone that's

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,260
watching you know at any point you can

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,790
jump into one of those groups or you can

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,860
add your names in these in these

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,700
sections or you can just sit and absorb

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:41,190
the information there is absolutely no

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:43,570
pressure to be in the workforce okay so

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,070
so these are good these are basically

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,070
going to be our groups now city plot

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:52,210
we've got two groups we've got a group

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,130
in the top section there with three

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,380
people at the moment and then we've got

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,230
a group in the bottom section there with

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,240
two people at the moment so we're gonna

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,860
use these as our two groups when we work

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:09,310
on the further tests and if anyone who

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,420
is absorbing and listening once you join

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,149
in one of those groups

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,320
Gipsy's chopped just to hear what

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,700
they're saying and hear how they're

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,839
working through the tasks and they can

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,050
do that but we'll also have an

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,230
opportunity for we're gonna see what we

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,760
can do as a feedback to the really kind

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,699
of way of doing things I think that we

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:34,209
might get to do that within hop in here

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:38,019
okay so back to it back to slides okay

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,730
so that was a bit of activity to get you

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,279
ready you ready to be working in the

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,019
workforce thank you very much for for

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,540
doing that I'm happy that we've got some

00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:49,180
participation I wanted to talk a little

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,250
bit about the open design project as a

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,870
whole and why I'm here and why I'm

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:58,600
talking about this subject so back in

00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,329
2018 and 2019 I was working for an

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,820
organization called Ushahidi Jimmy D

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:06,519
makes a number of different open source

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,160
and not open source humanitarian tools

00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:13,990
and I was working as a designer there

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:17,380
and I was very privileged really TV

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:21,970
working organization that makes open

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:25,959
source as its as its as its function but

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:28,029
as I was working there we were working

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,060
on design tasks within an open source

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:34,660
repo and I was looking and seeing you

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,399
know developers contributing to the open

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,170
source and I was there working as a

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,029
designer contributing to this open

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,860
source but as a as a paid member of

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:47,440
staff and I asked myself why are there

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,050
designers doing this same process you

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
know I'm here I'm working but you know

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,699
where are the rare the people like me

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,260
that are interested in the projects like

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:59,199
the open source projects that are out

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,600
there you know participating in this in

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,850
this kind of community and I found it

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,189
really interesting and really quite sad

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,290
that there wasn't more involvement and

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,750
more participation from from designers

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,419
in open source and I very much wanted

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,910
more designers to be working with me as

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:20,919
open source contributors as I was

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:22,449
working on a tool so in 2018 we had

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,509
conversations with and organized

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,600
designer who are a global design agency

00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,159
and they were interested in this problem

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,779
that we were having or this this

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:33,639
conversation we were having internally

00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:35,940
about how do we get designers

00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:41,409
contributing or how do we encourage it

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:44,470
designer created for us a design jam or

00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:46,779
a hackathon really on one of our open

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,970
source tools and invited roomful of

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:51,369
designers in Berlin to work on this tool

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,989
and we were like super cool you know

00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,759
we've never kind of seen things like

00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,679
that before you know we know design

00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,059
Germans happen but how do they happen

00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,649
when when there's an open source tool

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,019
and those kind of contributions that

00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:04,029
could happen afterwards and you know how

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,429
did how did these things work you know

00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,139
when when you're engaging with something

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:09,999
that already exists and already has a

00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:15,340
community contribution framework around

00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:17,440
it and some other organizations heard

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,779
what we were doing one of them was adobe

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,019
and adobe we were primarily interested

00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:24,850
because you Shahidi we as designers

00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,609
we're using one of their tools to create

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,919
design work and that was the tool Adobe

00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:33,609
XD which is a prototyping tool for

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,629
designers to make prototypes sadly not

00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:39,399
open-source so we will sat down and had

00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,259
a conversation together and decided that

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,879
we wanted to try and figure out how to

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:45,369
solve some of these problems about

00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:48,489
designers participating in open-source

00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:51,850
and how to encourage that and Adobe

00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:54,070
funded the first phase of this this

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,929
project of open source design

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,570
contributions called open design and

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,509
design it supported us throughout that

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,369
project as well so the combination of

00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:09,279
all of these organizations created the

00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:10,960
project of open design so what is

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:15,580
actually open design what does it can

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,789
design to open design looked at

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,129
primarily ways for designers to tackle

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,659
big societal problems by contributing to

00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,669
you humanitarian open source software

00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,950
which is Ushahidi software at the time

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:30,909
which is what we used as a pilot to test

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,429
how to engage designers and we've seen

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:35,960
this need across many many different

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:39,309
communities for design

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,570
in lots of different spaces not just

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:45,290
humanitarian open source for all open

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,400
source and we wanted to create we wanted

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,990
to do research and we wanted to

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,670
understand things that are we wanted to

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,470
test different things but we also wanted

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,870
to create something tangible as best we

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,870
could so we wanted to create a set of

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,420
methods and tools examples workshop

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,850
frameworks and we wanted to importantly

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,420
do events where we engaged designers on

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,070
open source problems and worked through

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,130
open source contributions with them and

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,050
for a lot of these designers in these

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,780
conferences and at these events that we

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,690
were organizing and participating in it

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,340
was the first time that they'd really

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:22,730
begun to understand what open source

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,059
really could be beyond the things that

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:29,720
are popularized in open source kind of

00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,980
out there in the ether right they really

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,170
start to understand that open source

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,240
wasn't just things in the terminal

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,250
wasn't just development frameworks

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,400
wasn't just for developers and did a lot

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:46,160
of other things that they could really

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:49,850
really benefit contributing to so we

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,510
used one of your hideous tools as our

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:56,240
first pilot project to test this this

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,559
project with the open design project and

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,380
they need to go into a little bit of

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,120
detail about the tool that we use the

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,490
open source tool that ishida created

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,570
that we used as a pilot and it's called

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:12,890
tempura and it's called an emergency

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:18,470
check-in for teams so what is emergency

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:20,960
check-in for teams me GED historically

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,350
has done a lot of work in the crisis and

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,690
disaster response face if she/he deals a

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,210
lot of history in providing open source

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,540
tools for people that want to respond to

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,130
disasters and crises is globally and one

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,140
of the tools that we created it after a

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,910
terrorist attack was the tool 10th floor

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,800
and what it was trying to solve with

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,170
this problem of when you're in a crisis

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,660
it's really difficult to get contact

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,710
with people that you want to know

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,900
whether they're safe or not

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,490
and you might email some people you

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,830
might text some people you might message

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,810
some people in other ways you have to go

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,550
through that process of trying to you

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,140
know check your texts for this person

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,620
check your email for this person and try

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,840
and find out whether everyone's okay and

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:10,290
what works

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:12,120
fix that this dissemination to you know

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,130
the the fragmented way that we

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,130
communicate and it tried to centralize

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,650
it to some extent in a domain

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,480
10:4 domain that you would have for your

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,640
organization where you could send out

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,070
one message to multiple platforms and

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,470
receive messages back via whichever

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,840
platform somebody wanted to respond in

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,310
and see really quickly and easily who

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,680
was okay

00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:38,430
and this is all open source though which

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,320
is excellent through the open design

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,910
project so it started off as a closed

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,990
source project and became open source

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:50,550
through the open design project and I

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,650
talk really briefly about what Tim 4

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,650
does because some of the examples that I

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,660
use are around open design and doing

00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,850
open source design contributions use 10

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,530
for as an example and it's kind of hard

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,210
to understand the examples that I'm

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,480
using if you don't kind of understand

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,950
what temp or kind of does and some of

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,140
the key things that make up that product

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,790
so those four key things that I think

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,500
you really need to know about temp or as

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,240
a product as an open source product is

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,910
that it's a web app it works across

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,150
different devices it has like a domain

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,330
URL kind of like a slack so company

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:30,450
named temp org sends out different

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,810
messages via different methods and those

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:36,390
messages are typically called a check-in

00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:39,960
and it sends them out through SMS voice

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:42,750
call email and in application messages

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,180
and 10/4 has multiple different user

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,750
types so there are people that own a

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,030
domain administrators

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,190
people that can send messages and people

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,560
that can read messages only there are

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,790
other you know tears and other details

00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,080
that make up the complex product that is

00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:04,280
10-4 but these are the key things you

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:12,350
need to know to use some of the examples

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:13,670
that we are going to refer to so the

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,180
next thing that we're going to do is

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,620
we're going to form our teams what we

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,320
really want to be looking for when we

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:25,070
form teams is we want to be looking for

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,260
a mix of different cells so you've got

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,110
people on the memory boards at the

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,120
moment there have put their different

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,010
skills down and this is really the first

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,380
thing that this extended session is

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,030
looking to teach you is a way of finding

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,470
out different skills that people have

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,650
different skills that people are

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:46,790
interested in to try and construct the

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:50,030
teams that would you would form to try

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,620
and solve open-source challenges or

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,090
open-source issues within the open

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:57,800
design framework so what we've got I

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,860
think at the moment I think we've got

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,930
two different teams and what we I want

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:07,210
to make sure is clear within the next

00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:10,340
few minutes is that each group need to

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,710
either pick one of the example

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,180
open-source projects that I've listed or

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,770
you can choose to work on one of the

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,230
open source projects that you yourselves

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,100
maintain or you've brought and add it

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:24,260
into that section on the me report

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,760
because what is really important is if

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,010
you're not using time for as an example

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,020
it need to be a open source project that

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,090
you're comfortable with and that is then

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,990
you're gonna get value from from working

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,330
on these these tasks from so you can

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,160
either choose one of the examples that

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,670
we've got and I can work with the teams

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,050
or we you can work on an open source

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,110
project that you've already you already

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,480
work on now but within your groups you

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,600
should agree what you want to work on

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,400
and whoever maintains or owns or works

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,720
on that project there is going to be

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,400
slightly more pressure on yourself

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,310
because you'll understand the project

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,170
than many other people that are not part

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:09,880
of the project so let's switch to let's

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,230
switch to the mirror board again and

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,750
make sure that we're getting in our

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,300
teams

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:19,240
okey dokey so at this point what I'd

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,930
like you folks to do so let's let's just

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:26,260
check the team so we've got Donald and a

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:30,640
big girl we've got Brian and Jim and I

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:35,770
think that that is the everyone that

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,270
we've got within this so we've got two

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,870
teams of two people which is totally

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,400
fine what I'd like you to do is on my

00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,310
screen at the moment what you should see

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,400
is a link next to group number one

00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:54,310
that is the Gypsy link for Abby and

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Donald and the for Brian and Joe you've

00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,890
got a gypsy link of the group number two

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,550
to be able to have discussions amongst

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:07,420
yourself about the upcoming tasks so if

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:10,330
you want to make sure that you have the

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,800
Gypsy rooms open so that you can vote to

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:23,950
discuss amongst yourselves

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:25,870
next we upcoming tasks okay so I just

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,000
want to go very quickly through some of

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:31,150
the examples that I've got that you

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,950
could work on so I've got a few links in

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,660
the mirror boards as well but on the

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,270
screen at the moment on my sides I've

00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,770
picked out a few different example open

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,860
source projects that you could decide to

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,180
work on we've got the tempura project

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,980
which is the issue you design for

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,600
projects the poly project we've got her

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,600
cut hair kiyah

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,550
we've got chain HQ their project little

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,770
window we've got leaflet which is

00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:00,100
leaflet jazz and we've got the pistol as

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,270
well so if you don't have an open source

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,310
project you were do you want to work on

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,610
you can pick one of these and I've got

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,410
issues further into the extended session

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,360
but it's completely up to you which ones

00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,800
you want to work on when you want to

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,740
bring your own or whether you want to

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,700
work on one of these

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:21,540
so you have your gypsy links for each of

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,430
your your groups to talk with your team

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,370
so I feel like this is the best way for

00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:31,240
you as individual teams to discuss what

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,970
you the tasks are coming up and the last

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,200
thing to say is within your teams if you

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,330
can as you discuss using voices see what

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,430
you can do to document what is being

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,800
decided even if it's very quick notes or

00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,170
we decided to do X you can either use

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,080
the mirror board or you can use a note

00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:52,590
stock if you prefer but there is face in

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,490
the mirror board to write in your notes

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:59,950
the documentation is very important so

00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,480
the task format just to cover what we're

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,220
doing we're gonna do a little

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,540
exploration by me then there's going to

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,330
be group discussion where there's going

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,590
to kind of be silence in the hop in and

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,360
then there's going to be a feedback to

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,390
the room hopefully we're going to see

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,070
how we facilitate that you can at any

00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,110
point the people that are working on the

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,850
task so any point head into the my where

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,130
by room to ask me questions if you need

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:24,640
things clarified I mean so I have my

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:28,270
where by room open and ready to listen

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:36,130
to any anybody's clarifying questions

00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:41,350
that they might have okay this is me

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:43,480
managing multiple screens okay so you

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,120
the first task the first service that we

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,860
have just make sure that you spend

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,580
anything from five to ten minutes in

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,600
your gypsy rooms talk about the open

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,100
source project that you want to think

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,920
about when you're doing your tasks and

00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,150
have a quick read to understand that

00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,830
project if you're choosing one that you

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,179
don't already know and work with if

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,620
you've got one that you're ready you

00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,360
know and work with share some

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,140
understanding of what that open source

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,390
tool project does have a think about

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,530
what the role is that you want to play

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,880
so thinking back to the tasks that we

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,040
did where we write down our names and

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,300
our skills that we have what we want to

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,380
share what we want to learn more about

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,600
one of the things that's excellent

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,040
about doing design-related Tulsa's you

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,900
could take on a different role so you

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,480
can take on a designer's role if you'd

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,850
like to and you need to you can then say

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,530
that for these tasks I am playing the

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,380
design role and I am practicing my

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,050
design skills for this role and you

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,520
could likewise some of you as design

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,840
related could practice being a

00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,980
development person in thinking and

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,310
development mindset

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,470
this is really weird sometimes but it's

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,820
very important to attempt to get into

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,220
the mindset of okay what would your

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:55,850
designer say when we're thinking about

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,980
this so see see what roles you feel

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:02,180
comfortable in but have a think and

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:05,840
Explorer about how you could inhabit

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,250
another role you might if there were

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
bigger groups you might want to pick

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,890
somebody that could facilitate

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,380
discussions and oh okay sure sure Jim

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,690
yeah you can you can all move to one

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,450
group I think Brian might want to move

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,200
to the group number one then if you're

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:26,240
heading out halfway through no worries

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,890
it can also be done solo these tasks and

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,330
can be done so you don't have to do in a

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,940
group but it's good to promote the

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,860
discussion and then you might want to

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:39,920
pick somebody to do some documentation

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:42,740
and work on the mirror board so for now

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,660
I'm gonna meet myself on hop in and I'm

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,790
going to go into the Gypsy runes and I'm

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,380
gonna have a chat with some of the folks

00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,620
in magic sea rooms to see how we're

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,620
going on

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,949
we're doing multitasks of different

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,229
video rooms here are different video

00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:27,509
rooms here we're trying things out and

00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:30,959
it's very very cool so we've got a group

00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:31,949
working like an open-source project in

00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,749
the moment so we're going to be going

00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:35,519
with that one it's a project called open

00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:37,289
source if you want to drop the link to

00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,150
it in the hop in chat that would be

00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,140
absolutely amazing if people other

00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,079
people will need to check out the

00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,920
project that we're doing this design

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,920
these design tasks off

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,190
sorry sorry about covering the mic so

00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,610
we're going to talk about documentation

00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:17,580
and we're done talk about labels the

00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,840
framing for this is something that we

00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,570
learned throughout the open design

00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,160
project was that designers in general

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,890
whether or not they know about open

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:29,220
source yet or not if they really want to

00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:32,160
work on a project for good and it's my

00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,860
firm understanding the pretty much every

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,110
open source project contributes in some

00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,210
way to something for good if it's making

00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,430
dev tools more accessible of its

00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,970
allowing you know a new way of doing

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,770
something within a certain tool set and

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,360
it's doing something for good there are

00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,960
more there are other open source

00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:55,050
projects that like do more clear stuff

00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,670
towards like humanitarian good but what

00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,310
we really found out was that designers

00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:01,380
are typically driven by what is the

00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,290
meaning of me contributing to this and

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,870
what kind of good am i doing by adding

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:10,710
my my value to this it's like a real big

00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:17,370
driver for them so I want to talk about

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:20,000
the remix of repos and projects so well

00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:22,950
the first task is is looking at is

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,350
working on your evening and how you

00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:28,890
include design as an explicit section

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,450
within your readme documentation I'm

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,210
going to give you a couple of different

00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,130
examples and we're gonna work on how you

00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,320
might start to include that design

00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,180
section in your readme of your repo or

00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,890
how you might rework it if it were the

00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:48,180
exists so we've got a link though at the

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:51,660
moment I can drop it in the truth as

00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:58,080
well so that it's a little easier to for

00:45:51,660 --> 00:46:01,560
people to get to and the design

00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,530
contributions section of the temp for

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,050
repo that I wrote for encouraging design

00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:13,260
contributions so this one's a little bit

00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:15,030
more large and ambitious but it's a good

00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,930
good one to look to as an example if

00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,670
your key

00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:21,609
so what we've got and here's a

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,619
screenshot of that link is a section

00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:25,960
about contributing to design as an

00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:28,809
open-source contributor for tempore and

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,819
what we've got here is a short

00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:33,339
explanation of how we've created the

00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:35,980
design for exempt or if it has design

00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:39,309
already so every project will have some

00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:42,339
kind of design whether it's how you've

00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:44,589
written your copy or a text or how

00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:45,760
you've incorporated some kind of visuals

00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:48,069
there's going to be some kind of

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,619
existing design even if it's how you

00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:53,470
structure the words that display in your

00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:56,290
terminal window that's still part of the

00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,720
design process is how to make that the

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,210
most usable part of whatever you're

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,260
building so including a section of

00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,359
saying this is what we've done already

00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,309
here it is here's where you can access

00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:10,059
screenshots of this and here's where you

00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:14,710
can access any existing design

00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:17,559
information or design examples so here's

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:20,530
where it is already one of the tricky

00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,690
things about design and you can perhaps

00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:27,609
see towards the bottom of this slide

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:30,670
where I'm waving my cursor is design

00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:32,980
doesn't have design files don't have

00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:35,319
great versioning and if you include them

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,390
within readme like this

00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,460
you don't inherently get some kind of

00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,930
versioning of your design files one way

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,210
that I found to work around that is to

00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:48,430
just include a time and date stamp

00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:50,859
within the readme text as well so moving

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:53,400
on from ten four is an example I am

00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:58,270
referring now to the pally project

00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:01,240
within their their projects and they've

00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,819
put in the section here an explicit

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,130
exception for designers and they're

00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:08,440
asking we need help we haven't had a lot

00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:10,510
of attention but we're interested in it

00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,180
and here's what we've got already so

00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,280
here is a project that's already making

00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,470
an attempt at saying we want to invite

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,030
more of this but we're not quite sure

00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,579
how to ask them we're not quite sure how

00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:25,420
to develop this so this is a really good

00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:27,970
example for how to start if you're not

00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,870
sure what exactly you need to put in

00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:33,020
there even just the intention

00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:34,640
saying please come and you know help us

00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:39,260
out even with what we want to ask for

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:43,220
it's a great start so what we're going

00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,290
to do now is in the in the Greek that

00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,380
we've got for the project that has been

00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,940
set we're going to think about what

00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,160
we're going to include in the design

00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,750
replay if there's already a design

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,090
readme it's useful to bring it up at the

00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:58,100
moment and share it within the group but

00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,740
if there's not think about how to answer

00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:03,230
these questions so how can you invite

00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,060
design contributions and what kind of

00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,130
supporting info do you have already that

00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:10,460
you can offer designers and what kind of

00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:13,670
asks do you have of designers and how

00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:15,590
can you appeal to that fact that I said

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,570
earlier that we learned to the open

00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,480
design project where designers want to

00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,800
work on projects for good as a focus so

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,550
thinking about how you can communicate

00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:29,090
what your project does in that kind of

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:31,070
sense of oh this project does this for

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:34,220
these people help us do this for these

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:36,470
people how do you want to how do you

00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,040
want to explain that to the designers

00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:42,800
that are interested so team team in your

00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,270
tixi room have a have a think about how

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,420
to answer these questions I'm gonna put

00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:50,720
myself on mute in the hop in we're going

00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:54,160
to work with in the mirror board as well

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,570
to make sure we document it and then in

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,680
probably just under 10 minutes time

00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,810
we're going to come back into the room

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,130
and hopefully we're gonna have the team

00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,130
feedback on what they've come up with

00:51:55,709 --> 00:52:04,029
this this is very true so you might get

00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,739
a little bit feedback in a gypsy room so

00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:08,349
hopefully everything hopefully

00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:11,049
everything is reasonably easy to hear so

00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:13,509
what we've got at the moment folks in

00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:15,670
the hoppin is we've got one we've got

00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:19,390
one group working on a open source

00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:22,749
project we are going to take a look at

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:24,910
the open source project now and we're

00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:27,430
gonna see whether they have a design

00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:31,959
read name in here and then we're gonna

00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:34,150
work on that so it looks like looks like

00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:36,670
there's some visuals in here for a start

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:38,680
which is always good at the very least

00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:42,999
you get a little bit of an understanding

00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,489
for how it looks and we've definitely

00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:47,109
not got anything to do with design

00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:50,410
contributions specifically that we've

00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:54,219
got contributing dot markdown so let's

00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:55,959
take a look always new screenshots of

00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:58,569
visual changes that's a good thing for

00:52:55,959 --> 00:53:01,749
designers to know but it could be added

00:52:58,569 --> 00:53:08,369
into a design section a design specific

00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:10,630
contribution section and we've got no

00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:12,309
we've got no specific section for

00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,319
designers which is it's just simply

00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:17,799
fines to be expected for most projects

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:21,489
so the group that I'm working with at

00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:22,959
the moment we're going to answer some of

00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,289
these questions together and I can hear

00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:29,769
you from the the room but what we

00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:33,849
could do is we could take this to the

00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:41,769
hop in if you think if we if we prefer

00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:44,170
that okay so I think if you can go into

00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:45,609
the hop in and if you're able to join

00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:49,959
the session from the hop in

00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:52,269
can you see like the ability to join the

00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:53,739
hop in to join like the voice chat or

00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:55,239
not because I want to make sure that

00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:58,209
that's available because if it's not we

00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:00,809
can't we can't we have to do this

00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:00,809
