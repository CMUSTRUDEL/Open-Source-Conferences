I work for a company called github I'm

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,740
just gonna jump right in I work for a

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,450
company called github if you ever heard

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,529
of it

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,699
congratulations you should definitely

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,560
sign up for account today if you're

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,010
interested in doing open source so

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,140
definitely check that out I've been at

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,310
github for roughly two years sorry a

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,890
little over two years and I'm a

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,320
developer advocate at github I like the

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,780
joke that I'm a Beyonce advocate and

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,190
it's because I like to mention Beyonce

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,270
if you cannot see those little slides

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,399
and the on the left then uh well I guess

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,780
you didn't see it coming but this is my

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,550
social this is what I looked at good

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,550
name that is what I look I can chat as

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,559
well and yeah that's my full name Bryan

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,750
Douglas I go by be dougie almost

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,329
everywhere and be dougie on Twitter

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,309
because there's a dad he likes to play

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,550
video games who is be dougie on Twitter

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,960
so feel free to give him a follow if you

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,460
would like he's he's very friendly and

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,900
he does a really good job of sending his

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,390
my tweets on my way excellent yes and

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,950
this will be open to all skill levels

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,150
too like I'm gonna talk I'm gonna do

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,799
talk about a high level I'll show you

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,210
some stuff and then hopefully you'll be

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,880
able to interact with the the Ricoh as

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,710
well all you only prerequisite which I

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,210
didn't mention was again of account

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,530
that's the only thing that she needs so

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,170
you had you don't have to get up account

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,439
it will be challenging to access to repo

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,939
if you don't have it I call myself a

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,009
Beyonce advocate cuz I joke that I'm

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,900
queen bee github is 50 million

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,880
developers worldwide who used a product

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,920
and as a developer advocate I get to

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,170
advocate for those developers so these

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,479
are developers that have come from all

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,049
different types of walks of life and I'm

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,210
also I used to be a Navy as well roughly

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,060
eight years ago so I I started coding

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,290
thanks to Luke which is now a bootcamp

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,689
at the time I was named a bootcamp it

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,520
was a some idea where I was learned how

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,610
to code online and used to do sales

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,229
prior but the concert question I asked

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,869
for myself is what would they do

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,299
and it's because Beyonce goes to that

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,380
for the hive there is a gift that would

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,360
have played if I had this full screen

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,370
but that's the joke go to bat for the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,560
hive and the way I go to bathroom hive

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,540
is actually educating people around

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,310
things that like other features and

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,959
github that you can leverage is which is

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,690
all going to tie in an open sourcing and

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,480
get up as well

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,500
github in the past year and a half

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,030
they've been working a lot on these

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,290
things that we call internally github

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,420
primitives we don't really have this

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,430
anywhere outside or in marketing pages

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,530
but in a lot of the engineering all

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,750
hands in the conversations we talk about

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,300
get up primitives and primitives are

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,410
things like the API the authentication

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,630
layer web hooks now these are all pieces

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,340
that you might not be aware of like like

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,019
if you don't know what API is I highly

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,750
recommend like do a quick would compute

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,830
Wikipedia searches but these are ways

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,480
for you to interact with the github

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,220
product so if you want to build on top

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,489
of that or build improvements to the

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,870
platform that solve your issues so

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,790
perhaps there's a missing feature of

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,519
connecting different people across the

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,130
globe that we aren't really we aren't

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,209
really noticing highly recommend check

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,400
out some of these things that I'm going

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,510
to talk about soon but those primitives

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,709
come together and they build these

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,709
things like what I'm going to call this

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:20,640
workflow automation so automation for

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,109
things like this you have a task that

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,790
you do so you work in a team or maybe

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,260
don't work in a team like the first

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,900
thing that I do every time I open up a

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,880
pull request it when I'm on my team is I

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,200
go directly the slack and I paste that

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,870
pull request directly in the slack

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,790
Channel and I wait for someone to

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,290
respond or review my code and what

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,209
happens is Tuesday comes along because

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,130
it's oh I guess today's Tuesday so then

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,540
Wednesday comes along and then no one

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,940
actually reviews my pull request and

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,290
then Thursday comes along and then no

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,609
one reviews my paw request and then

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,579
Friday comes along and I just give up

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,370
because it's Friday and I want I don't

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:57,000
want to have to squash bugs on the

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,310
weekend so with that being said I'll go

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,359
into how we solved that problem in a

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,910
moment but I also want to talk about

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,260
something I like talking about which we

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,709
don't have right now which is basketball

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,420
I guess it would have been over yeah it

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,760
would have been over around now or is it

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,200
the beginning of June or into May anyway

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,389
we didn't have a we never full

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,190
basketball season for four reasons but

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,479
if you aren't firmly a basketball

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,340
basketball to sport it's sort of like

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,039
soccer but instead of kicking the ball

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,460
outside you bounce a ball or you dribble

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,450
ball inside on a wooden court and this

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,400
is exactly what a

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,470
Court sort of looks like and there's

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,770
idea of like full court layups where

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,870
there was when I was younger a kid there

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,790
was this player called Allen Iverson and

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,260
he played for 76 years and he was very

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,390
popular for his full court layups

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,580
meaning that he was though you have a

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,840
team of five he was the individual to

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,980
take the ball from one end of the court

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,760
to the other of the court and make a

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,040
score point without passing which is not

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,690
always okay like it's a like depending

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,030
on how bad or good your team is like it

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,160
could be pretty sad to see someone

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,230
always shoot the ball and never give

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,040
anybody else a chance but you know it

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,080
worked for him I mentioned that because

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,210
full court layups is a thing that works

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,950
sometimes but also it hardly ever works

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,320
because gonna have you're gonna be

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,630
defending against five other people I

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,380
read a book which is called coupon omics

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,930
it's it's a sorry I read a book which is

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,280
it was a actually ever I forgot the

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,500
title it's like literally sitting over

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,090
there but the term that they they coined

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,770
inside the book is called Koopa Nomex

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,270
and it's very similar to the thing that

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,100
we also think of is Moneyball

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,410
so Moneyball there's a movie in a book

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,690
that came out the movie starred Brad

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,480
Pitt and they leverage statistics in

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,890
baseball to identify who are the best

00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,570
players that we're gonna get on base

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,210
because if you can if you can get on

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,920
base then you're gonna eventually get

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,810
people enough people on base that

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,190
they're gonna score runs now they take

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,010
that it took the same concept of

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,930
basketball and they found out that no

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,090
matter where you shoot on the on the on

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,250
the court there's this one spot which is

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,660
called area 31 so if you just run

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,330
directly to that spot and shoot from

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,550
there you have a 31% chance of it going

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,560
in the reason is because most players

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,700
are actually right-handed so it's it's

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,490
actually a little more difficult to

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,900
defend in that corner also that distance

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,460
is actually the perfect distance for you

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,590
to actually shoot and roll off your

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,990
fingertips and get a swish and like

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,880
actually practice an angle it's a it's

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,390
just uh it's just a bot spot where most

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,060
people will just run too and usually or

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,650
you run too in that location and this

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,440
was like more of a phenomenon towards

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,910
the end of the last decade I know where

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,980
at the end of this decade but the decade

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,210
prior prior is when I started really

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,860
discovering this and even in the last

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,410
five years you sort of blew up with

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,850
Golden State Warriors which is the

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,960
basketball team that I'm local to I also

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,020
haven't mentioned I'm based in the Bay

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,690
Area here in California so next to San

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,220
Francisco and the basketball was a big

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,580
thing a big big deal in the last five

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,110
years up until the last season so what I

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,520
want to talk about is things like Warfel

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,930
automation and automation and your

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,580
approach to your development workflow

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,230
and like this sounds like it's gonna be

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,580
a super high like super like in the

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,810
weeds and kubernetes like there is a

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,620
docker longer session that's happening

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,410
actually it must be starting right now

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,780
but uh like that's not this this is

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,210
gonna be like you you sort of point in

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,130
like update yeah mo files and it's gonna

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,970
be some hired cons like higher level

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,860
stuff but what I was getting at is the

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,830
automation and the things like area 31

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,840
type of automation which is don't do the

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,390
hard things over and over again figure a

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,160
way out to make those ways easier so in

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,020
this instance the first person takes the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,880
ball in they pass it to number two

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,950
number two actually shoots the ball it

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,840
and keep in mind there's other three

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,520
people that can also pass to just to

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,170
make sure that you get that the ball to

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,300
the the shooting guard which is gonna be

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,700
number two apology is like I usually do

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,270
a better job of explaining basketball

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,640
and stuff like that but I I like to

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,140
assume that every issue is someone's

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,120
first issue that's a quote from Stanley

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,300
who's the one of the creators of Marvel

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,230
Comics who passed away last year or the

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,560
year before and so if anybody's confused

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,780
by anything I said please please just

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,400
let me know and I can I can re-expand it

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,600
I'd love to I'd love to have an

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,330
opportunity to interact with you and

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,010
sort of explain that but I explained all

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,410
that and I explained basketball for four

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,270
reasons but I explained that because

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,460
things like the the automation that

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,550
we're gonna be doing is instead of you

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,360
taking your pool request and then adding

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,660
it to slack

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,780
every time you have like a new PR to

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,790
look into like instead build some

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,560
automation so that way every time a pull

00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,410
request is open the automation actually

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,390
opens up a message in slack letting the

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,360
letting your team know that the issue

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,950
still needs to be reviewed so if

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,300
everybody if that all makes sense and

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,339
I'm cool to move forward

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,350
and we can jump into repo just give me a

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,290
thumbs up or an emoji in the chat they'd

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:07,920
be super helpful

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:09,420
excellent GTG cool alright so as I said

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,940
this is workshop time it's gonna be

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,380
hopefully hands-on I'm gonna take a lot

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,690
of breaths I know I said a lot of words

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,640
so what's gonna happen is I'm gonna show

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,649
some stuff I'm gonna have you read on

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,950
your computer and also have it on my

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,899
screen as well and then from there while

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,450
we have some breaks as like normally

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,640
what would happen is we would do this in

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,649
a session I did post this link in the

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,000
chat earlier but what I'm gonna do is

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,310
post it one more time because I see

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,180
quite a few different people actually

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:42,959
jumped in since I started so this this

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,209
link is gonna be the the org slash to

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,940
repo that we're gonna be working in so

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,589
please take some time to navigate there

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,230
and then almost gonna ask for another

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,060
emoji or like a thumbs up just to let

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,779
you know that some people have arrived

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:01,140
to here actually you should be the link

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:09,180
will take you to this repo and I'm gonna

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:10,440
take a breath apologies to my I don't

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,940
know I don't know if you could actually

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,040
hear my daughter crying in the

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,490
background we are doing homeschooling

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,490
today my wife is actually and we only

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,010
have two more weeks of school left all

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,279
right I guess what I'm not talking I'll

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,860
just hit the head to good old me button

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,279
as well all right excellent so we are

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,930
all here at this X all right cool good

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:42,690
to hear also she'll be okay we have this

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:44,760
uh this repo this is true i i've

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,520
definitely perfected the sleeping

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,709
through crying thing which is also scary

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,800
but also a good thing depends on what

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,850
day it is or where you are but uh I

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,720
definitely have learned this sleep

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,040
through that stuff cool looks like

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,640
actually some people already jumping in

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,350
so this week this repo is intentionally

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,240
everything that's written in the readme

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,830
as well as the other files will guide

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,480
you to so this

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,089
this project you could actually go

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,200
through self-paced if you wanted to but

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,540
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,880
breaths and talk through and then and

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,310
it's in between me taking breaths and

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,200
talking or from talking filter and ask

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,370
questions if there's anything I can get

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,829
details I've been working with github

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,890
actions and github for like I said two

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:30,390
years so I don't cover all the content

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,820
that I could probably give to you so

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,279
please show me repose show me your

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,750
projects I can talk through if we want

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,360
we could take a sidetrack to build an

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,730
action together for the most part we're

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,380
gonna be touring actions and if we have

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,720
time at the end I'll I'll walk through

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,079
how I approach building an action as

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,760
well excellent so first step is I need

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,920
everybody who would like to participate

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,800
there's no pressure like you also this

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,140
watch and listen and take notes you'll

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,050
need to go to this issue which I'm going

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,459
to assume some people already done it

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,370
yep looks like six people seven people

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,610
have done them so far you just want to

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,120
type the word invite and then me you can

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,160
also invite actually I won't talk about

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,660
that but just go ahead to invite me and

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,680
then we'll talk about how this works in

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,670
a sec so well watch your faces Joe join

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,190
in say yeah

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:30,020
so EJ glitch girl thank you very much

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,020
ready set Joe all right Joel bergoglio

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,490
it's funny that um so I github the thing

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,750
is if you ever weren't when working to

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,570
get help if you don't apply let me know

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,399
feel free to hit me up with idioms but

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,230
we use our handles for everything so in

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,440
slack on be dougie on github of me

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,690
dougie to get paid on be dougie so your

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,910
handle is everything I get up so it's

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,339
funny to see the difference of handles

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,800
because if you if you help somebody like

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,699
if if I talk to you like the first time

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,199
I say if you start the interview

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,060
processes think about the handle you

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,680
want to have for life because once you

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,810
have that handle yet it's gonna break

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,529
forever if you want to change it so uh

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,760
yeah I always coach people all the time

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,920
it's part of the any of your process but

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,899
um I say that because there's so many

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,610
handles that I'm not sure how to say out

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,589
loud and that's just like the life of

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,350
github you never know how to say their

00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,010
name because we're we're a distributed

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,770
company so we are

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,450
percent remote as of today so meaning

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,820
that despite that the fact that I live

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,030
in the Bay Area and only 15 minutes ride

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:35,020
to the office right now the majority of

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,030
the company is not in the office oh yeah

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,890
so sorry the note2 as well

00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,660
you gotta get blasted by notifications

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,090
so you want to go ahead and hit that

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,410
unsubscribe button right here this is

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,960
mentioned the readme but you could

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,150
possibly just jump directly past that so

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,410
please unsubscribe because your

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,130
notifications are going to be

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,500
obliterated

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,910
if you don't yeah good call out yes if

00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,320
you use the github app you probably see

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,030
all the notifications a stream in

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,850
through all you know all of our friends

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:09,240
so it looks like we have 29 participants

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:11,440
in roughly 51 in the room right now and

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,520
the next step that I'm gonna basically

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:23,140
ask for is does anybody want to try to

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:25,240
guess how this works my apologies I

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,130
should have usually I just say read the

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,580
readme and then hopefully people catch

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:34,570
the unsubscribe thing did I be sure that

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,380
that is 6 30 seconds actually did I put

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:40,000
that note I'm just subscribe no I did

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,740
actually I don't think I even said that

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,930
in there

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,940
my bad well now you get to you get to

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,680
try out the new bit hubs notification

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,780
feature as well which is this so if you

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,390
aren't aware we've made a we made a big

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,730
overhaul to notifications where you

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:03,190
could actually filter by participating

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,490
which no technically I created the issue

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,600
so if you commented you will what to

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,010
read me oh cool

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I'll answer that in a sec but yeah

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,310
because I create the issue I'm not

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:18,880
participating I'm actually the created

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:20,440
person so let me take a step back oh

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,620
you're just joking ok I was gonna

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,820
explain what a readme is but um for well

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,530
you mentioned it so a readme is

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,000
basically gonna be the entry sort of

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,410
like the front door of most github

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,880
projects and this is how github

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,630
basically approaches open source and

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,770
code

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:43,090
it also has a lot of awesome stuff cool

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,680
and that's an image alright alright so

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:49,090
we have enough people in there the next

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,610
step and we're gonna I just thought I

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,580
actually did a test so we did said part

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,080
0 which I invited everybody to org what

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,490
I want to do while I'm talking if you

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,170
haven't done it yet if you add yourself

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,760
to be attendee txt I want to see mainly

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,110
says this is mainly for my own personal

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
enjoyment

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,230
we're gonna have some merge conflicts

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,880
and collisions for everybody doing this

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,230
but feel free to do that and then I'll

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,900
talk through some of those PR so to get

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,590
me open for that for now I want to talk

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,200
about how I'm inviting everybody to see

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,540
this repo which is a very clever way if

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,540
you do any sort of content or

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,770
collaboration with like a team like when

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,150
you start at github the first thing you

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,460
do is you'll get in your onboarding

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,710
class and you all doing the same repo

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,000
and then we have a bot that actually

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,290
invites you to the repo so I this this

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,850
action was actually inspired by that bot

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,730
because that bot was actually running on

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,850
the server and I made it with a with an

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,440
action which looks like this so if you

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,280
didn't catch that I went to the doc

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,080
github folder

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,490
they got doc hidden folders sort of like

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,870
the so sort of hidden secret sauce of

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,550
github and how you sort of enable a

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,350
bunch of hidden features and get up I

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,820
don't have time to sort of go into all

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,740
those features but I will I guess I will

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,150
talk about a couple of them as we go to

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,630
the content because they do bring up one

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,130
of them at least cool so the doc hit up

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,350
folder has another folder called

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,960
workflows this is where all your actions

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,790
will live inside this works with folder

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,860
and I have one that's called invite that

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,750
gamal so that's what that is and this is

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,480
what it looks like so all of that all of

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,900
actions are built on top of sorry all of

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,330
actions you interface with Yale so and

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,340
we'll go into more detail in part one

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,680
but I'm actually flagging I'm looking

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,510
for an event called issue comment so

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,070
every time an issue is commented now I'm

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,870
not limiting it to just one issue I'm

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,410
Linh actually this is working for all

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,730
issues

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,100
so if anybody wants to open up a tissue

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,620
and test this feel free this project is

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,180
open source and then if you created

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,880
the types that I'm looking for that of

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,470
those workflows is created or edited so

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,210
if you create an issue or sorry if you

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,640
create an issue comment it will didn't

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,320
invite you but you have to do that and

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,940
invite which I'll show you how that

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,640
works in a sec and then if you edit it

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,990
because I've noticed when giving this

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,460
workshop people will forget to like to

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,870
spell something wrong or spell invite

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,340
wrong so I want to give them an

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,140
opportunity to edit that but now I have

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,330
to create in the hole in a comment just

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,940
knowing debugging and having no test

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,680
that we run on I guess this is sort of

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,810
preemptively did that I'm naming is in

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,260
my contributor which I'll call out in a

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,960
second all actions run on jobs so you

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,750
can have twenty concurrent jobs running

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,060
on one repo so if I want to have twenty

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,940
different actions running at the same

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,980
time I could but twenty is the limit if

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,390
you have like a paid tier the

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,190
documentation I think the first paid

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:46,780
tier which is your team you get like 40

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:48,190
and then like 80 and I think call a

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,160
salesperson I think after that I think

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,040
that's what it says I have no idea I

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,990
don't pay for github part shouldn't say

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,850
that loud because you should pick for

00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,260
github if you need it anyway I'm also

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,940
using a third party action which I'll

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,280
get into in a sec so let me just punt on

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,990
that and then what I literally wanted to

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,790
call out

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,140
sounds like my kids are really fighting

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:13,000
right now hopefully everything's okay

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,190
I'm actually calling the action directly

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,350
in the code I've written into this

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,260
passions folder no this action folder

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,910
which the way it works is that it's

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,060
looking in the root if you aren't

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,700
familiar with how this file lookup looks

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:31,420
like and particularly this is bash that

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,010
sort of powers this as well and the

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,910
reason well sorry I'm like sort of like

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,830
stumbling through because I'm like

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,900
explaining too much up front but I'm

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,090
also using a Nabu to image which is why

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,030
I sort of back access to that bash as

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:46,000
well feel free to stop me ask questions

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,110
if I'm confusing anybody as well also if

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,590
you want me to explain what to read me

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,900
as I will so don't tempt me

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,730
all right so some of this look could

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,710
look confusing I'm using a docker file

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,330
that's not important right now what is

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,940
important that is that I wrote this in

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,200
and this is what it looks like you could

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,760
write actions and whatever language that

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,960
you want actually have an email with

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,620
somebody who wrote an action ain't Oh

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,659
camel which I'm super interested in and

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,750
I just want to call out that I'm using

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,490
the octa kit library octa kit is a SDK

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,470
for the github API and something that I

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,260
wish I knew about five years ago when I

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,289
rebuilt it from scratch not knowingly

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,880
add another company so if you're

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,830
interested check out octa kit if you

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,440
want to interact in your project with

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,210
github and then I'm checking to see this

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,730
is my check for an invite that invite

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,200
has to be this this is the way Ruby

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,899
works and the way I want it to work and

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,049
then I'm doing very very naive code

00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:42,760
where I'm just taking that that was the

00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:44,049
word that you put I started the phrase

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,029
that you put in your your comment which

00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:48,909
is invite me and then checking to see if

00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:50,409
it's me or handle I have this extra

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,510
feature because some people have had

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,769
issues and getting to work so if I

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,049
wanted to invite somebody else I get

00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,690
this at mention your handle and pull

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:02,440
that out and finally I'm using again

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,299
octo kit to add someone to the team so

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,630
everybody's been added to the the one

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,830
bucket team as well so that's how how

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,590
that works if you have any questions

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,240
please raise your hand ask me to slow

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,139
down I'd be happy to explain anything

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,049
else even if I don't know the answer so

00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:23,429
next thing is I want I wanted everybody

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:25,539
to go through part zero that a and I

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,940
don't know why my notifications are

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,669
going crazy I already see some people

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,269
have pretty done this so as I mentioned

00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:36,070
in part zero that a I did ask you to go

00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:37,419
through that I also mentioned that

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,299
there's going to be some merge conflicts

00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:43,330
because it's by the sheer nature of get

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,970
you will be can see what is sharing

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:54,720
anymore stated I was having issues

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:58,659
seeing my screen no yeah I guess Melanie

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,429
suggest would be like a refresh if that

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm I can sort of call out what I'm

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,090
looking at at the moment too as well

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,100
which is the readme and I'm gonna call

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,350
out that most people looks like seven

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,270
perhaps maybe ten people went to your

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,370
part zero a which is more of an exercise

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,860
for myself and

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,420
I ask people to open up an issue sorry

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,850
open up a PR to add themselves in

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,050
attending that attendee dot txt now

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,059
these were all failed because they're

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,630
gonna be merged conflicts but I did want

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:31,150
to look at some that closed any of them

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:34,390
closed its interestingly it failed but

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,580
still merged so basically what I have is

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:41,950
I have three more actions that I wanted

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:44,950
to run and actually I'll look at the

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:51,400
success no actually that's none of them

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:58,420
are successful they've all failed but

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,780
they merged all right we'll try this one

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,690
more time

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,240
alright cool so I have three actions

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,580
running yeah yeah and yeah you'll have

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,990
to resolve your own conflicts feel free

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,410
to close it like this is super trivial

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,820
like I I just wanted to showcase in

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,400
action so I'd said everybody do at the

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,800
same time and you can see that I have an

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,660
action that sort of shows up once you've

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,800
opened up the repo yeah so basically

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,500
what's happening as things are

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,270
collapsing because if everybody's

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,059
changing the same line number five or

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,890
twelve and then you change number twelve

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,420
it's gonna not know what's happening and

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,250
it's gonna fail it's gonna feel pretty

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
miserably and the with the action

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,760
workflow to you which I'll talk about

00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:43,960
failures and logs in a sec but you can

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,280
see that Jake if you didn't know that

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,600
that's a cool feature if you just hover

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,540
over someone's name you can see their

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,110
actual full name instead of I am I Jam

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,550
bro it's a great name hopefully I said

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,010
that right though so Jake actually

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,860
opened a PR which he's adding himself to

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,420
the list so you can see that perhaps he

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,750
had it some merge conflicts because

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:09,340
looks like maybe Jeff and him could

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:12,910
collide it together but um seems like

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,880
the regardless I do want to go and look

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,320
at what does this action that ramp so

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,390
the way I could do that is either click

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,010
through here or I just want to call out

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,350
that the the existence of the actions

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,970
tab as well and then I should have

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,869
probably clicked through Jake

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,679
because I'm gonna look at someone

00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:32,879
completely different but yeah this

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,169
actions tab is gonna look at all my of

00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,960
running action so you can see some other

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:38,460
people are also attempting to work on

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,899
this it's probably not the best example

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,799
I probably figure that bag is a better

00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:45,720
example for people to get indoctrinated

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,749
into actions but you can see this action

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,580
ran so two of the three actions actually

00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:52,799
ran and I'll talk about that in a sec so

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,259
I've got this action which is auto proof

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,059
so any PR that opens I went to Auto

00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,309
approve like this give me a thumbs up a

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,580
checkmark and then I have another action

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:04,169
that labels the issue when it's approved

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,259
and the way that works is it adds a Auto

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:09,779
merge label so it seems like everybody's

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:12,359
sort of gotten that passing and then

00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:16,950
what it really falls over which I have a

00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:20,940
feeling I know why and it's because this

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,600
action sorry actions are for security

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,850
reasons they don't provide as much

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,249
access to the repo as we used to when I

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,389
first started doing this workshop but

00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:32,549
rather to make it make assumptions let

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:37,200
me just go ahead and show this and you

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:38,970
can see I have a failure basis not exist

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,679
all right actually this is not even that

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,419
this is a essentially this is the

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,759
conflict where the everybody tried to

00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,970
merge at the same time I master the the

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,859
difference always changes so it's sort

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,220
of it's a second nice fun thing for me

00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,019
to show the team back at github and give

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,200
them a nice example of how we could

00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:03,119
perhaps improve improve the platform but

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,739
I say all that because I wanted to the

00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,799
showcase that I have multiple actions

00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:09,840
running so the feature itself is called

00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,940
get up actions but these could have

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,499
actions the combination of could have

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,119
actions are called workflows which I've

00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:16,830
already I've already mentioned that term

00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,179
a couple times and I'm like waving my

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,549
hands look at myself in the camera but I

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,049
realized that actually no you can see

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,210
both to me yeah yeah you see my screen

00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,799
and me so I wasn't sure if I was sort of

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,879
like explaining on my hands with for no

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:32,820
reason but I do want to show how this

00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:34,379
works and we're just gonna ignore all

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,859
the other open PRS I'm gonna run a

00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:39,030
script and close those I have another

00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,770
workflow which is

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,880
Auto approve that yeah mo and I'll show

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:46,140
you how that works and again all this is

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,390
open-source so right now like I'm

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,620
working in the start here repo but if

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,420
you wanted to go at your own pace and

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,430
look at this and read the content like

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,890
I'm at living the content because I've

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:58,760
done this enough times so I might miss

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:02,040
some stuff to you so reminder feel free

00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,850
oh that's a great question and actually

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:08,790
I always forget about that you should be

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,500
creating a pull request to this I don't

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,120
think you have access rights to push the

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,920
master correct me if I'm wrong if

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,440
anybody's done that but you should be

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:23,100
opening a PR when you add yourself to

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:24,690
the attendees oh it did okay

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,400
well first thing you learned about open

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,590
source is don't push the master and that

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,930
we all learn firsthand that's what sort

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,390
of is keeping us out of sync at the

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,770
moment too as well that makes a lot of

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,800
sense because if you push the master

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,200
which I'll walk through in a sec but I

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,000
wanted to call out so I talked about I

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,490
didn't talk about this but the name of

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,810
my action is auto approve and merge if I

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:52,500
went to the actions log you could see

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:54,180
that name right here I don't you want to

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,620
i recommend naming your actions

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,270
otherwise it's gonna be called pull

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,930
request so it's gonna default to

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,410
something like that

00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:03,630
same thing with jobs the jobs itself

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,610
i've added a custom ID which is called

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,650
built i couldn't name this something

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,410
better but at the moment it's called

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,780
build this should probably be called

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:15,090
approve workflow or something and it's

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,460
gonna run on a boon to so actions

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,040
themselves they are powered by camel but

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,210
underlying technologies or VMS the cool

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,760
thing about this is that it gives you

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,740
access to to runtime to run arbitrary

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,870
code as you saw with my inviting I'm

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,270
running arbitrary Ruby code to do stuff

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,690
stuff on github I don't have to run up a

00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:36,270
server or now open up I my wallet and

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,070
start paying for you know AWS credits to

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,680
make this work I'm able to get access to

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:44,310
this just by having an a repo in github

00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,410
which is another beauty of this inside

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,780
of a job we have this this keyword

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,880
called steps and these are synchronous

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,660
steps so they have to go one after the

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,090
other

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,700
if you notice with this Auto approve

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,760
action it actually ran and then this one

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,010
ran but then this one failed if this one

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,810
failed it would actually not let the

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,250
auto merge one run at all I would to

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,050
skip it and then let you know there's a

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,750
failure so when you use the steps

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,480
keyword and run synchronously if I would

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,390
just run instead of a I have build if I

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,860
just made this label and had a flag

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,290
which is build that sort of lines up in

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,630
the little tree of Hamel it would run

00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,610
asynchronously so the build would go and

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,140
then the label would go it doesn't

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,630
matter who does it first it just happens

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,760
eventually so that's what I'll just call

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,980
it that the other thing is that and this

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,370
is all explained - and the readme I'm

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,420
actually pointing to another github repo

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,960
this is the cool thing about this is

00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:43,380
that this is a actually I might be

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,450
surprised perhaps a hairy remove this

00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,830
okay he did it so it so exists so this

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,150
is an auto approve action that's built

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,360
by another one of my teammates at github

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:54,390
and this is open sourced all the code

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,770
that powers this exists right here and

00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,100
it looks like it's written in JavaScript

00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,080
Oh

00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,520
typescript even better so it's written

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,020
in typescript so never break

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,280
sorry that's a jab but it's written tied

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,580
scrape and it's using this library

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,880
called actions core which is actions

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,970
core is also gonna be the actions

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,380
toolkit too as well which imma me

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,680
originally the last time I gave this

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,640
this talk actions toolkit did not exist

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,930
so the content has not been updated to

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,990
include that so what I'm gonna do is go

00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:32,340
here Nexen think it's this fellow wrong

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,410
I don't know I'm not sure what happened

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,750
I'm gonna pop that into the chat in case

00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,370
anybody wants to spend some time looking

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,690
at that if you get a build an action

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,820
today and you know JavaScript

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,490
I haven't recommend looking at the

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,830
actions toolkit the toolkit itself you

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,450
start by installing actions core and it

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,580
gives you an SDK to interactive actions

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,350
all the actions I've done have been hand

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,210
written and powered by docker containers

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,700
is which is not the roof it's a

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,230
recommended way in the readme especially

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,560
if you're using other languages that are

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,420
not supported in the toolkit but how I

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,240
recommend doing the probably the the

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,630
path that's well tested which is

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,070
this way right here but Harry's he's

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,170
essentially doing something very similar

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,250
I was doing in Ruby but is doing a

00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:20,630
better using a better pattern for it

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:22,460
cool let me move down the other thing I

00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,390
wanted to point out so I'm running

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,070
actions toolkit but if you notice also

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,410
after the app I'm running it on a very

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:34,070
specific release tag now if you haven't

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,810
dealt with released tags you probably

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,690
have used projects or libraries that are

00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:41,900
cut for releases and what I mean by that

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,780
is if you go to the releases section so

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:48,230
I'm on the readme I've just zoomed into

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:50,660
releases you can see that Harry has well

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,000
looks like he's cut to releases am i

00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,440
running on to dot - OH - no okay I read

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,930
that wrong so he's got two different

00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,430
releases the way to publish an action is

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,230
you actually actually have to cut a

00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,260
release so that way no one gets a

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,370
different version of the code so that's

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,470
what I'm doing he's kind of released

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:10,390
which means that at that time on

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,890
September 11 2019 maybe never forget

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,180
there's a version to barato that he cut

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,210
and that's the version I'm running on

00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,950
there's also a version called one dot oh

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,570
that oh that I'm not running on but if I

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,130
wanted to for whatever reason there are

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,990
some actions that I run old versions on

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,600
because I'm just don't have time to

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,790
update the code and if anybody does

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,370
anybody yeah should I explain semver

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,680
because I'm ready here so semantic

00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,870
versioning the three different zeros the

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,240
first version is going to be the code

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,820
breaking release so between one and two

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,650
something on the project changed that I

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,980
need to either update my code that helps

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:48,920
to use it second number is gonna be the

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,450
minor release which is not breaking

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,400
changes but maybe a feature was added

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:56,090
and then last one's gonna be like a bug

00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:59,660
fix or hot fix as well so he's made

00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:04,730
drastic change between February and

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:06,320
September excellent all right and then

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,490
finally the one that the action that's

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,380
giving me the most problem is this

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:13,010
autumn I'm sorry I didn't talk about

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,360
label so this is the label action this

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:19,210
one I want to point out that I'm running

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:21,770
on master which is essentially

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:25,490
when you walk into the repo for this

00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:27,049
project I'm just saying whatever gets

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,900
merged master I'm gonna run them in my

00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,520
code this could potentially be dangerous

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,740
so I just wanted the point that's out as

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,049
well if you're gonna run in action or

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,760
you forget our use code from NPM like

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,590
there's a reason why like if you use

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,660
Google Chrome the version of chrome that

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,929
I'm using right now is Google Chrome

00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,120
Canary so this is literally me if me

00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:49,190
running Chrome on master so what they do

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,600
is every night they have a build when

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,690
they make all the changes they publish

00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,880
that to to master it gets deployed and

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,590
then Brian uses it and gives it at our

00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,690
workshop on it or gives it at our

00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,280
workshop using that browser and hoping

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,620
that nothing breaks so that's literally

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,600
what I'm doing that's what I'm doing

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:10,159
today in this workshop but I'm also

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,540
that's what I'm doing by doing this but

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,210
the reason why I'm actually pointing the

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,609
master is because the cool thing about

00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,950
this is that though I'm working a master

00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:20,210
this is actually a fork so another one

00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,090
of my co-workers actually built an

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,649
action that was working fine for them

00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,109
but I was like you know what this thing

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,580
needs more features so what I'm gonna do

00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,929
and like the way you would do open

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,970
source is I'm gonna hit that fork button

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,190
I'm gonna write a little code to make it

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,869
work for myself it's gonna work and then

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,510
I'll push that back up to upstream and

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:40,510
do a pull request and work on that

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:43,580
that's like hands down but big it's the

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,869
value and it sounds like street-sweeping

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,290
is happening outside so you might be

00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,639
hearing that the biggest value of can't

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,010
have actions is that a lot of this code

00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,240
is open source so if you're curious of

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,760
how someone did something or you're

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,410
curious of how the kubernetes team is

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,369
running their entire infrastructure or

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:03,050
running their automation to notify

00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:05,930
special interest groups leaders on how

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,640
to be notified whenever is PR open like

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,369
you just go directly into a repo and

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:17,780
look to see how that works so if I went

00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:19,670
to github and this Pam estab is a it's

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,510
an org and they're focused around

00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:26,359
machine learning I'll address that real

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,790
quick in a sec but this is like a

00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,680
project that I don't know enough about I

00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,850
don't do any machine learning I just

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,900
know that machine learning is a thing

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,789
that people do and there

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,349
projects but they're using this action

00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:39,770
that I've sort of lifted and put in my

00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:41,059
project where they're actually if you

00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,890
open up issue and you want to assign

00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:44,539
yourself to the issue you can't do

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,190
unless you're a part of the org and the

00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:48,020
way they work around that is by using a

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,839
github action and that's what this looks

00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,460
like here we don't have to go into

00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,049
detail on how this works we can talk

00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,809
about that later but I just want to

00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:58,789
point I wanted to point that out because

00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:00,230
you could fork a repo and you could take

00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,819
that code and then publish that as your

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,130
own action like it is open-source if

00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:06,289
there's a license like obviously you

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,599
want to attribute their license or

00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:11,809
attribute the code to them but this is

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,869
MIT license which means that it's all

00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:16,069
good to do whatever you want and you can

00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,359
click through it all so this isn't about

00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:18,890
licensing there's actually a whole

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:23,329
nother talk that was earlier around

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:24,920
open-source licensing cool the actions

00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,660
tab lists workflows that were trigger

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,289
and how does this one look over actions

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:33,730
as they've been configured for the repo

00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:36,020
independently or whether they've run

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,539
triggered how does one look at a Shazz

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,789
it they've been that that have they

00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,890
contribute I'm assuming that's what that

00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,869
is

00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,640
yes let me finish real quick and I'll

00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,339
explain your area hopefully I'll have an

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,380
answer for you the right answer for you

00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:54,099
the auto merge bot same thing this is

00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:58,190
another fourth repo that I published and

00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:59,539
onto a branch so here I'm actually

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,520
calling this action from master I

00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:04,430
haven't even done a release is this

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,920
actually running any code that's on

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,230
master right now which is the only

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,730
branch I have because this is a fork if

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:15,559
I go to the auto merge action which it

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,279
seems like I do need some open source

00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,059
help on this one

00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:22,789
I've actually me for this from Pascal as

00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:26,569
well and I'm running it on this branch

00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:32,690
which is called bot and the way you can

00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:35,059
see that is by that flag right there

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,010
which it's a branch name so you run

00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:38,690
actions on commit shots so if you wanted

00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,529
to run it based on a commit rather than

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:46,539
a branch when I say a commit sha I'm

00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:46,539
talking about this

00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:56,090
it is quite speedy today means I gotta

00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:58,780
take a drink appreciate the question of

00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,780
Mitchell Oh

00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:07,340
seems like github has having some load

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,470
issues but this is a commit shot right

00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,300
here so you can see that this commit has

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,030
a special number if I wanted to run it

00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,790
on this this version of the code at this

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,910
time of day when it was pushed March

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:24,320
24th I could actually do at that number

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:26,840
as well excellent

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,290
so answering Mitchell's question how do

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,880
I know what actions have been triggered

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,830
you could do one of two things I can go

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,660
to directly to the github workflows

00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,030
folder and see if there are any actions

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,290
installed on this project I've got a

00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,510
couple of different repos I could I

00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:44,570
could walk through like I showed panthis

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:47,210
and their workflow so they up to one for

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,890
CI and one for assigning issues and then

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,630
the way I could see what what actions

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,160
have been triggered looks like they're

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,869
actively looks like 11 minutes ago they

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,220
just pushed and they have a massive

00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:58,310
project so this is gonna take a while

00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,990
but you can see what they're working on

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,580
you see what actions are running you

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,290
also have a nice little filter over here

00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,730
so if I wanted to see how many times

00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:09,980
someone actually is used as a sign

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:13,099
action you can see this was used 18

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:17,780
minutes ago as well as part of this this

00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:20,750
issue yep the workflows folders is your

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,730
source for true they're the actions

00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,359
experience team I think is what they

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:28,070
call themselves

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,650
they've been updating this this place

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:34,160
like pretty like frantically and like a

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,510
lot so I'll be surprised if this source

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,810
of truth are the source of true for the

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,859
github workflows folder won't eventually

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,780
navigate here so like right now you can

00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:43,369
see what's run but if you wanted to see

00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,380
and edit different workflow files you

00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,900
could actually do that hopefully in the

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,220
future from this page as well other

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,050
question or actually trigger on events

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,200
only are they scheduled and cron based

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,670
triggers that's a great question and I

00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,320
don't cover until the very end of the

00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,240
session so in case we run out of time

00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,960
the answer is yes you can do cron based

00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,640
triggers

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:11,330
you can run actions based on github

00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:14,900
regular github events as well alright is

00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:20,990
this about my daily browser github help

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:23,540
Docs okay hi this is the browser I use

00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,730
to do presentations because it doesn't

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,690
have my regular github account so that

00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,870
way you can see all the cool features

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:37,970
we're shipping or the features we

00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:39,380
shipped last week you have actions so

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,710
I'm just looking at the github help Docs

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,570
because I'd never remember anything but

00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,360
in help doc says it events that trigger

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,010
workflows that's one I do realize so

00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,980
this is directory

00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,690
and then you can see a list of different

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,440
types of web hook events so you can run

00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,790
them on checks

00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,920
you don't want checks are checks or

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,810
things that you enable onto your repo so

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,890
like Travis CI circle there's a bunch of

00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,010
them to check so you can actually enable

00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,600
to do things with your code or repo but

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,740
the whole list of events and I'll talk

00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:15,830
about a few of them coming up in a sec

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:18,070
cool so I have sort of gone on a slight

00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:21,320
tangent because I haven't even got to

00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:22,790
part 1 of this tutorial which I answer a

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,830
lot of these questions too so i'm gonna

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,310
power through the hello world because

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,930
that's gonna take you doing some action

00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,820
there was not a pun but no pun intended

00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:34,280
but yeah you're gonna have to take some

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,430
action in the workshop so what i want

00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,560
you to do is actually go to part 1 so if

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,140
you did not see in the readme scroll

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,240
into the bottom to actually start part 1

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,520
and then we'll start talking about

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,530
events and triggers and more details of

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:53,480
the the Gamo that is there for us so and

00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,010
then the first step i'll explain you do

00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,400
want to create a sandbox repository

00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,530
inside the org so github Kraftwerk is

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,580
the orc you can also do this on your own

00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,020
repo but it's gonna be a lot easier for

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,670
me to find if you have questions if you

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,650
do in the org it really it's your

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,790
preference I had everybody did in the

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,670
org because we were all in the same room

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,049
I can see everybody sort of doing it

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,549
I've also had the other problem where

00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:18,710
people will start using going through

00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:21,530
the workshop when we don't have a

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:28,160
workshop it's like I just let people do

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:30,319
whatever they want that's a new feature

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,049
and I'm glad you asked that include all

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,030
branches so are you forking the project

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,410
if you've got to invite to the org you

00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:39,790
should not have to fork you should be

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,790
able to create a repo directly in there

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,690
so for clarification if you create a new

00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:49,069
sandbox for COD soup or a by clicking

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:53,690
this link it should be into github

00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:58,130
Kraftwerk and not not in like your

00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:01,790
personal work and that is because there

00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:04,130
is a in the CI portion publishing the

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,780
NPM actually does it

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,579
I forget what step it is I apologize

00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,790
there's one step that requires you to be

00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:12,230
in the org and not into your own repo

00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:15,470
the CI portion will be in your own repo

00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,510
and then I'm what it says is create a

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,809
template so this is a feature that came

00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:22,910
out roughly three years ago almost three

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:25,579
years ago get up we can create templates

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,569
for your repos and I created a template

00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:28,339
which is called hello world

00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:29,930
feel free to name or whatever you want

00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,630
it's always gonna be easier if you add

00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,750
your name to the main so if you like be

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,490
dougie hello or that's oh it's available

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,349
I was gonna say it's taken but it's

00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:43,220
available so feel free to do that one

00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:44,569
will be very confusing and then make it

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,420
a public or private repo I think I've

00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:48,530
enabled this is on a free tier but

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:54,470
probably making a public so that way we

00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:57,200
anybody could see it and then include

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,760
all branches yeah see this so that this

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,280
is a new feature that came out like in

00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,809
the last three weeks where we need four

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,119
can create templates you can include all

00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:07,490
branches you only need the default

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,750
branch so you don't really need to check

00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,670
it because everything that's on masters

00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,099
waiting all the other branches army

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,200
testing and adding iterations to it did

00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,609
I haven't deleted so thanks for the

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,049
question oh yeah that's that this is

00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:21,640
literally a feature only shipped in last

00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:24,020
three weeks so that did not exist until

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,079
recently

00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,079
[Music]

00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,640
excellent so everybody take some time to

00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,060
creature on repo I'm gonna take a breath

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:42,090
and a drink of water as well let's put a

00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:43,260
cough drop in feel like when I talk to

00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:48,500
you much my stroke gets a little

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:51,869
scratchy so I have to eat a cough drop

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,820
cool and start at 12 so we roughly have

00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:55,020
like an hour and 10 minutes to as well

00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,080
so I think of the pacing is actually

00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,750
pretty good right now and keep the

00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,740
questions coming too as well there's a

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,570
even if they're off-topic like if you

00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,940
just have general get have questions I'm

00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,440
happy to I reserve the right to punt

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,330
them until later but if you have them

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,470
I'm happy to answer them if you have

00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,710
answered question ask questions all

00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,930
right

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,710
actually there are questions up here so

00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,000
while you're doing it I'm going to

00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,570
answer some questions I sort of hopped

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,570
in that I missed

00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:33,000
which I think apologies I'm your name

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:34,950
last name Sekar syak so yak what's the

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,560
difference between actions and a CI

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,750
appears to be pretty similar why not

00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,200
just call it CI if it's not that

00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,600
different

00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,859
that's a great question so the the

00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,930
original time when I actually started

00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:47,700
doing this content you could not do CI

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,109
of actions and what happened when we

00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,690
ship this feature it was really all

00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:53,250
around automation and developer

00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,760
automation which is going to be part 1 &

00:45:53,250 --> 00:46:00,350
2 of this workshop part 3 we did do CI

00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,270
so just spoil or we will talk about CI

00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,070
github actions is it's more than CI so

00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,710
yes you can run CI you could run test

00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,000
when you open up or quest but what I

00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,270
didn't mention is there's some other

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,250
stuff

00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,510
clever things you can do so I was

00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,180
already mentioned and asked about cron

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:22,020
jobs cron based triggers so I have a

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:25,910
github action that it lives okay here we

00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,910
go let's here

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:40,220
I have a repo where I test I'm just off

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:41,960
hot test beep Oh excellent so happens

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,140
repo and I gots a bunch of stuff and I

00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:49,700
have an action I might have deleted it

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:52,369
I did delete it anyway I have an action

00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:59,660
that runs on a cron job and I can just

00:46:52,369 --> 00:47:02,630
uh let me see exactly this one so this

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,940
is an action I'm running on this folder

00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,970
so it's this is my resize action I was

00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:10,099
testing or I'm taking anything that gets

00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:14,000
added to this topics folder that's a PNG

00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:14,599
or a ping I want to resize it to 288 by

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,339
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,960
this is like a common problem that I

00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:19,640
haven't a lot of stuff like open source

00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,980
blogs and Jeckle blogs and stuff like

00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,720
that where all the images are is kind of

00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,640
crazy and they come out all over the

00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,049
place of different sizes so resizing

00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,520
every image that gets uploaded to a

00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:33,109
branch or PR super helpful this is this

00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,150
would technically follow Windham like

00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,549
the whole CI realm or part of the

00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,880
process of CI is great

00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:42,230
anytime PR is open I update the image no

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,890
one's the wiser everybody's happy

00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,510
the other cool thing is cron jobs which

00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,980
I have a cron job unless I explain but I

00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:52,809
want to I wanted to show how it works

00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:55,430
so in this right tab add the edit button

00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:58,250
so this pencil here if you didn't know

00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,539
you can edit files directly in github so

00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,779
I hit that pencil right there I'm

00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:05,329
editing the file on this right bar so

00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:07,490
this is my yeah mo on the right here

00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:09,529
I've got some example actions that I

00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,180
could actually install my project which

00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:12,260
is great I'm not really I don't care

00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,270
about those right now but you should

00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,130
definitely check those out over here

00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,270
this actually documentation so I sort of

00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:19,970
struggled through searching the

00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:22,069
documentation and finding it earlier but

00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,720
you do have some basic documentation but

00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:26,510
I wanted to call this out because I knew

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,920
it existed right here so one the events

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,650
that trigger war flows it exists right

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,589
here if you wanted to find that out but

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:36,920
- you have a cron job so if I wanted to

00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:38,299
instead of run this every time someone

00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,350
does a pull request which I have right

00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:42,320
here

00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:44,630
perhaps I wanted to run this once a week

00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,600
or once every Monday Tuesday Wednesday

00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,810
Thursday and Friday so every weekday at

00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,660
2:00 UTC which is I have no idea what

00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:55,220
time that is so I wanted to do that I

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,630
can just run a cron job based on that

00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,340
and the cool thing is that it helps you

00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,340
out a little bit and tells you

00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:06,699
this is gonna be every UTC at night 9:00

00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:12,399
a.m. to UCC which is I think where I'm

00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:15,249
at minus 7 so this is plus 9 so I guess

00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:17,219
it's like Australia I don't know I'm not

00:49:15,249 --> 00:49:19,119
sure where that timezone is but anyway

00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:21,729
that's how you can do a cron job so I

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:25,179
can run this on that folder once a week

00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:27,069
once a day if I wanted to so imagine you

00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:30,130
taking a bunch of work and processing

00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:32,139
images takes a lot of compute time so

00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,089
rather than run down every single time

00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,619
someone opens a PR you want to run it

00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:37,209
once a week so that way you get all that

00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,739
compute I'm out of the way this is a bog

00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:41,109
on the rest of the site does it bog down

00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:42,880
the rest of q4 PR is getting merge and

00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:44,979
you just do that like that we have an

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,019
action on my team because my team is

00:49:44,979 --> 00:49:49,749
remotely distributed so I'm in

00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:52,389
California but by my boss my manager is

00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:54,249
actually in Ireland and then my coworker

00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:56,049
is actually in Australia another

00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:58,299
co-worker who's on the other side of San

00:49:56,049 --> 00:50:00,069
Francisco so like we're very rarely in

00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,749
the same room at all times and we're

00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:03,939
also not in the same time zone so

00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:06,519
instead of us go do stand-ups together

00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:07,989
every morning we instead once a week we

00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:10,869
have an action that runs on Sundays

00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:13,479
because Australia my Sunday is their

00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,729
Monday I have an action that opens up an

00:50:13,479 --> 00:50:18,399
issue called top 5 and we do our

00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:20,469
stand-up asynchronously in an issue and

00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:22,419
then when our team meeting on Tuesday we

00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:24,639
sort of talked through actually are

00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:26,229
teaming Monday's now we talk through all

00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,269
the stuff that's in there and then see

00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:30,130
if anybody needs help and we drive our

00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:34,089
conversation in the issue during the

00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:35,919
week so hoping that makes sense

00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:38,049
as the question I'm like ci we will talk

00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:40,059
about CI in a sec but some of the stuff

00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:42,249
it doesn't really apply the containers

00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,899
integration or continuous delivery it

00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:46,089
really applies to if you zoom out and

00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:47,139
more automation so I considered

00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:49,529
integration is actually getting your

00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:51,999
test to run every time you open a PR

00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:56,799
opening up an issue once a week on a

00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:58,630
Sunday is not really CI and that's what

00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:03,399
I really meant by it's like it's more

00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:06,459
than CI all right so everybody should

00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:08,669
have open up a well everybody who's

00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:11,669
participating should have opened up a PR

00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:11,669
too

00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:20,430
okay cool so having to I guess I keep

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,700
picking on already fry your first name

00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:27,100
it doesn't work with it Jake

00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,200
I already picked up Jake but by sheer

00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,840
luck Jake it's been picked again so Jake

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,030
open up the using the template inside of

00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,190
get up crap work you actually generated

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,510
this from there as well so you can see

00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,980
it's been generated from the HelloWorld

00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,800
template it's one we call that out

00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,850
because tippling temperately pros is

00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,100
something that not a lot of people use

00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:49,230
so it's gonna you know be an advocate

00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:52,150
and talk about the product by default

00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:54,430
you get an action because it the

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,140
template you have an action here so you

00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,030
have an action that's already run and

00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,590
I'll talk about how that action works so

00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,290
I'm gonna go back to the code you have a

00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,720
github folder you have a workflows

00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,250
folder you have a hello Yamma which you

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,280
didn't write I actually wrote it so

00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,570
congratulations you're using my code

00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:18,880
alright using my yam will file not

00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:24,240
really much code this is the session for

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:27,190
developer automation and tools so I

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:31,350
don't know which one you're looking for

00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:36,940
sorry someone came through asking so

00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:41,350
this is my session why am i blind can't

00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,820
see oh no not this one this one yeah so

00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,210
this is a session on here develop

00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:49,950
automation with github action

00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:53,380
so hopefully that schedule will help you

00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:59,410
but yeah going back to going back to

00:52:53,380 --> 00:53:02,140
here we have a very simple action okay

00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,850
yeah it's also Eastern Standard Time and

00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,440
I'm sure it's as helpful I was super

00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,580
confused time zones and I've been

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,730
strugglin times those his entire

00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:14,290
workshop so I trying to explain UTC plus

00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:16,810
9 well let me explain Jake's action that

00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:18,520
he's inherited for me so every time

00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:21,400
there's a push so whenever someone

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,410
pushes something to a repo so it counts

00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,570
when you create a new repo that is a

00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,800
push you've pushed it to github though

00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,250
you didn't go to the command line or get

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,860
a best

00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:31,960
or another tool like tower and pushes

00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:36,190
again hub it's created your initial push

00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,540
for you a this also it's been inherited

00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,310
name which is called a workflow from my

00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:42,970
hello world action it's kind of jobs

00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:44,560
this job is called build I thought it

00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,240
said hello at one time but I should

00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,260
really stop using the word build to name

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,440
my actions because it's not very

00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,210
descriptive but um has a name called

00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,240
hello were actions it's running on Abood

00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:58,980
- if I wanted to I could run this on Mac

00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,820
OS our windows there's also

00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,750
opportunities for you to self host your

00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,470
own runners as well

00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:07,000
so if you need something like arm or

00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,980
something different to sort a test like

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,080
actions is not only specific to web

00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,910
development there are actions that are

00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,260
built in the CI platforms including like

00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,960
canvas which I should which is machine

00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,790
learning some of this things need to

00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,990
work on different environments there are

00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,820
some tools that I use that only are

00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:24,280
accessible through homebrew on the Mac

00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,170
OS sub tools they're only available in

00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,120
Windows so depending on you how you

00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,380
write code you should be able to run

00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,880
your action though at that same sort of

00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,740
way so when we start talking about CI

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,690
like you want to recreate that same

00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,390
environment that's on your local laptop

00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,920
or desktop and again to action so if

00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,380
you're gonna run tests but this one's

00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,640
super simple it has one secretive step

00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,980
so I'd actually don't even need this

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,820
steps but it's there and it's this

00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:51,040
echoing hello and this if you aren't

00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,320
familiar this is like this is using bash

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,260
so the word echo is available to you

00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,840
because it's using bash natively in the

00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,950
Linux VM and the reason I say Linux

00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,150
because a Mbutu is a linux distro

00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,530
apologies if I'm over explaining but I

00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,840
just want to make sure if everybody's

00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,480
not on the same page at least we're all

00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:13,300
gonna get to the same playing field the

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,000
same level Oh looks like Jake's been

00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,830
working hard too you've already got your

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,820
second PR up but I want to show the

00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:23,890
first one so keep keep at it

00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:28,710
first one you were to solve is that as

00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:31,420
soon as you open up hello there you go

00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:33,130
and you see the word hello so echo is

00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:36,900
emitted because the command is to

00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,900
basically echo that in to the

00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,920
no problem Jake I'm still

00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:45,190
over-explaining so you've got a huge

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,900
head start but basically what you see in

00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:51,400
the log is exactly what we expected

00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,960
which is the word hello next step that I

00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,460
see it's like most people maybe some

00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,320
people are still catching up

00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,300
feel free to catch up also feel free if

00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,660
you've got a bounce take care of kids or

00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,700
whatnot

00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,880
all the stuff is available this repo

00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,110
will never go away so feel free to take

00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,850
this repo share your share with your

00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:08,320
friends it's all there it's also open

00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,880
source too as well it's gonna point it

00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,190
out so there's a spelling error which I

00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,750
found I despite that how many times I've

00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,990
given this I found spelling and grammar

00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:19,600
issues I fix before I am actually did

00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,370
actually fix yesterday of all times but

00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,560
um yeah so if there's anything that's

00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,700
server that does not seem right

00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,860
so if your crappy are I'm happy to

00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,390
submerge that actually what's gonna

00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,950
happen is you open up the PR it's gonna

00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,960
auto merge because the actions I showed

00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,520
earlier that are set up it will auto

00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,510
merge and we're set in there so please

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:41,380
don't add random stuff or I will have to

00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:43,150
block you from the the org cool so the

00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,570
next step that Jake what are we just did

00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,830
is that with this idea since we're using

00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,320
bash we have the idea of having

00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:53,380
variables so if you want to use like the

00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,810
dollar variable syntax we're gonna set

00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,400
up an environment variable which will be

00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,770
your based on the instructions it should

00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,450
be your name so we're gonna test that

00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:04,000
out and I'm gonna catch aches tough

00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:09,940
since I'm I've been already all up in

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,610
his uh his code already so update the

00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,200
hello and it should've say hello Jake or

00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:17,920
hello Mary or whatever in the name he

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,780
said hello Jake good choice so that's

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,100
the next step and the way that works is

00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,110
that this environment variable is

00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,970
another flag again all this is going to

00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,500
be available to you and way more better

00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,810
context and I can do in the

00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,220
documentation so if you're like I don't

00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:33,070
understand this or this context here

00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,590
like open up a PR explain this better or

00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:37,660
or go to the documentation which i think

00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,450
is linked right here we could actually

00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:45,160
learn more about what is happening here

00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:48,580
but basic stuff we're just trying to add

00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,290
in a variable we gonna find out shortly

00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,369
after that it when I explain is that you

00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,700
don't actually have to put your own

00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:57,940
in there because every time an action is

00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:01,059
triggered if it's triggered by me or by

00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,009
J going a PR or by somebody else in the

00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:06,059
chat opening up a PR on a project just

00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:08,619
gonna have the concept of github actor

00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:10,029
and these will be anybody who's

00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:13,420
triggered that action so this could be a

00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:15,490
bot or this could be you and I'm gonna

00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,779
take a guess that the next one I'm

00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:22,240
looking at is Jake

00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:25,539
making his update to instead of switched

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,009
at to himself it's gonna switch to oh

00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:28,480
you haven't got everybody to get ahead

00:58:27,009 --> 00:58:30,819
of you but if you swipe that that

00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,579
variable to get a back there it'll be

00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:35,740
your name so I'm gonna take a break in

00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:38,470
case people are going to just finished

00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,789
and walk through the sections and I want

00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:42,279
to answer any questions that you may

00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:43,690
have I'm love I would love to even if

00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:46,269
they've been asked already if I need to

00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:55,420
better explain something I'm happy to do

00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:57,579
so yeah so Mitchell your question around

00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,910
the user interface being work in

00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:02,829
progress always this github comm is not

00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,509
a feature complete product like we're

00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:06,190
all constantly always iterating on it if

00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:08,470
you saw it it looks like six months ago

00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:10,720
you'd be shocked anybody could actually

00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,249
get in thing down with them but some of

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,539
our power users were super excited and

00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:15,009
gave us a lot of good feedback when the

00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:16,930
when the product when the feature was in

00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:18,460
beta give actions is no longer in beta

00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:20,890
but the time when I first started this

00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,170
project or I started workshop it was in

00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,579
beta so there was a lot of sort of

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:26,829
cutting corners and explaining

00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:32,829
over-explain even more explaining of how

00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:40,390
things work cool then we answered the CI

00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:42,839
question yep yep branch question

00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,839
answered

00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:57,200
excellent so part zero in part one we're

00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,970
supposed to be super they're

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,280
intentionally trivial and it's mainly

00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:04,280
for me to be able to explain things like

01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,650
the jobs and the steps and the ideas of

01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,300
builds I did also I didn't I realize I

01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,910
never explained I never should pointed

01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,950
out but I didn't point out the name a

01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:15,740
workflow for my github action is

01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:19,780
actually labeled here another cool way

01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:22,670
to label the actual job that gets run

01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:27,380
HelloWorld action that actually actually

01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:30,440
being named here under the build as well

01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,720
and then I have another name which is

01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,310
the steps so I've intentionally spelled

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,200
and did everything differently so you

01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,480
can actually see how that works cuz in

01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,280
the event that we had failures earlier

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,930
which I should go back to and we could

01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,630
talk about you know the logs in more

01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:47,470
detail it's going to be much easier for

01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:50,630
you to figure out what's failed and when

01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:54,140
by you adding names to things so you can

01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:57,349
see that this hello world that I named

01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,030
here for the step that gets run has that

01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:01,670
name that it's actually using right here

01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:03,410
and the beauty of that like this has no

01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,599
failures in it but the beauty of that is

01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:09,440
that you can go and either search in the

01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,849
logs and find out what's wrong or you

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,130
can actually either download an archive

01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:15,290
of it so if you want to zip and look

01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,580
into a text file to see exactly what's

01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:18,650
wrong what's wrong

01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,730
because some of the projects you're

01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,770
going to work on it's gonna have very

01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:24,859
long logs and some of them like this one

01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:26,869
only has two lines then the cool thing

01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:27,950
is that you can do view the raw logs so

01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:31,520
instead of downloading it you can

01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:40,280
actually see the entire log right here

01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:43,070
as well and this is hello Jake but I did

01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:48,609
avoid the error messages as well so let

01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:48,609
me jump into one of these errors

01:01:52,780 --> 01:02:00,970
and we get sort of a prob explain I'll

01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,970
probably remember exactly what's wrong

01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:09,299
resource not accessible by integration

01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:19,419
so let me see

01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:22,900
was this a fork yes it was a fork yeah

01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:24,429
so I didn't explain this I sort of skip

01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,529
past this because I thought I didn't

01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:28,689
answer but I move forward because I was

01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:29,679
over I spitting like I felt I was

01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:33,269
spending too much time in the beginning

01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:37,539
but this one failed because it's a fork

01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:39,939
and I actually it's probably fine that I

01:02:37,539 --> 01:02:41,469
did I forgot to mention not to fork the

01:02:39,939 --> 01:02:45,039
repo to add yourself to the attendees

01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:47,650
txt but essentially like you editing a

01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,569
file directly and getting the approve

01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:52,029
requires it not to be a fork to get out

01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:54,640
or approved forks cannot be on our

01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:57,999
cruise for security reasons so you need

01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,909
extra you need extra what do you what am

01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:03,609
I trying to say you need extra

01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:06,459
privileges and permissions to be able to

01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:08,890
edit the file based on a fork because I

01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:11,229
could what I could potentially do is add

01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:15,669
this outer approve action to any project

01:03:11,229 --> 01:03:17,289
on github and any project actually it

01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:18,519
actually opens up a really good

01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:20,529
conversation around the end up tokens

01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:23,380
any project on github can have this

01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:26,229
action be added by PR and then I have an

01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:28,989
auto approve action that runs on the PR

01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:30,640
that otter approves and merges my PR so

01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:33,009
imagine me being about me being a bad

01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,400
actor like this would not be good so for

01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:38,769
that reason I didn't talk about this but

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,809
this github token is what allows it's

01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:43,029
given to you by default from github and

01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:45,059
get up actions and it allows you to do

01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:47,349
some of this clever stuff in automation

01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,179
the only issue with it and the only

01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:51,189
issue we're finding here with forks is

01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:53,319
that this github token by the fault does

01:03:51,189 --> 01:03:56,319
not give access to Forks to do

01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:59,799
destructive things or merging PRS or

01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:03,009
editing files the workaround for this

01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:05,439
and I will not add this because then

01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:05,829
this project will just get really out of

01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:10,419
hand

01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:16,480
oh yeah close somebody's good workaround

01:04:10,419 --> 01:04:19,839
for this is what I'm doing here

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:25,390
which is provided my own token which

01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:30,119
I'll get to now is it this one or is it

01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:30,119
this one I do have an example I

01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:41,020
definitely saw it earlier what I think

01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:44,230
it is is oh you know it is it's the

01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,180
invite to invite you know so you here

01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:48,550
see here that I'm actually not using the

01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,349
github token though it's provided to me

01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:53,109
twofold because I can't

01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:54,670
the base layer of permissions for github

01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:56,890
actions does not allow you to invite

01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:00,970
people to your org what I had to do is

01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:03,150
actually create a token to explain in

01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:05,050
the documentation but I will go through

01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:07,240
explain that so that way everybody gets

01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:10,810
the context and sort of commits that the

01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:13,210
memory if you'd like in the settings so

01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:14,920
I just went to my profile with the

01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:17,740
settings there's a section called

01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,920
developer settings here you can create a

01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:24,579
custom token and again this is my side

01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:28,980
project app I grab a custom token that

01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:36,250
has ads permissions for organizations

01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:41,950
and then with that permission I have to

01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:43,000
add access to the org and admin so this

01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,520
is the permission that will give me

01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,950
access to invite people to a repo if you

01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:53,890
wanted to give someone access to write

01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:54,819
repos appointment actually will control

01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:58,329
a repository

01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:59,560
oh well which one is it anyway it's one

01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,720
of these I think it's the first one

01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,660
maybe this is inclusive read read/write

01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:10,350
access to their repo well that's private

01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:14,430
repos oh actually

01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:17,520
it's just the first one which noticing

01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:22,770
my trackpad this time so let me plug

01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,500
that in funny enough I did not get a

01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:27,810
notification that the batteries go

01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,100
alright so I'm back alright so this is

01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,590
the one that would give me access to be

01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:35,270
able to let you create forks on the end

01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:37,950
and attendees that TXE so that way

01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:40,290
anybody can open a fork and merge it

01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:42,270
there but I mean I remember I actually

01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:45,300
discovered this but that was in a bug I

01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:46,890
discovered this limitation earlier in

01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,680
the lifecycle of the feature for actions

01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,900
and then I I ended up kicking off a

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,100
whole discussion on Forks and that's a

01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:57,540
discussion that happens all the time

01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,070
been using the custom token to work with

01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:03,750
sprint review dashboard thank you so

01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:05,100
much for making it ok excellent yeah so

01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,270
yeah you definitely want to if you're

01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,850
gonna do something a little more

01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:10,800
extensive or a while better access you

01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:12,870
want to create a another token I didn't

01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,820
explain to you as well so I have a be

01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:16,230
dougie token and this is intentionally

01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,940
I've named this because I want to make

01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:20,000
sure it sort of hammers home that this

01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:25,080
is not the token that github gives you

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,310
the way to I just realized I'm on the

01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,310
wrong browser to be able to show this

01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:38,460
somebody to my other account in hub

01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:40,230
after work so the way to add that token

01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,110
the way I get it I'm logged in to my

01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:45,900
other account too as well so if you see

01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:47,280
anything sensitive please take a

01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,870
screenshot and post them on Hacker News

01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,430
just kidding

01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:54,720
yeah so I went to settings for the repo

01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:56,910
actually settings here on this tab and

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:59,190
then I went to Secrets

01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:01,260
oh I haven't done there but you can see

01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,220
I've added the secret so that token that

01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:07,200
I would have created in the other

01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:13,680
browser I can add and say this is a 101

01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:17,819
token I wanted to and let's do a nice

01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:20,609
long token I'm sure that will work and

01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:22,259
and I could actually this leverage fill

01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:23,400
that circuit name so the names of valid

01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:26,730
I was actually curious if that would

01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,040
work so it actually has to be one on it

01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:32,369
doesn't fake numbers and I think that's

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,020
a limitation excellent

01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:37,529
also shout-out to my mechanical keyboard

01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:39,329
I don't know why this error message

01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:43,799
okay this added but my ear meshes never

01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:47,099
went away looks like I have an issue for

01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:49,199
my team to look at why is my issue not

01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:51,480
clearing alright

01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,889
you see how I do my job live I'm gonna

01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:56,310
go open an issue and the engineering

01:08:52,889 --> 01:08:57,540
work and tell them cool so yeah if I

01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:59,009
wanted to I could switch that token

01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,259
instead of beat up you took it I could

01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:03,869
switch it to 101 because I just made up

01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,250
that that key it's not gonna work so I

01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:08,369
won't even do that because it would just

01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:11,849
be silly but I can again change this to

01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:13,079
be 101 token and then everywhere we're

01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:15,109
gonna have action stinks that there's a

01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:17,159
get up token it does hop replaces this

01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,630
these environment variables are actually

01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:20,880
super useful and we'll get to that in

01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:22,049
the CI section actually on the based on

01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,480
the time I'm not sure how ever going to

01:09:22,049 --> 01:09:26,219
get today npm deploying which is fine

01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,449
because that process has changed and I

01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:30,230
wasn't confident then it would still

01:09:27,449 --> 01:09:32,460
work the way I wrote it I wrote it away

01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:34,799
that did not think that when we did not

01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:38,429
have the feature existed also ironically

01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:39,929
we did not own NPM as well I'm seriously

01:09:38,429 --> 01:09:42,359
working on a way to make this more

01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:44,040
integrated process so probably not worth

01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,099
really going through that section

01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:49,440
because that's gonna change really soon

01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:51,270
so yeah that's how you would do a custom

01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,980
token if you have CI or even have a

01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,500
service or let's say you're not doing CI

01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,790
with actions we use CI with Travis or

01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,869
circle and you want to integrate that

01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:02,849
with actions really closely you can do

01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:04,770
that by just adding an environment token

01:10:02,849 --> 01:10:10,380
and then running erection the way you

01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:12,540
would want it you can use the accounting

01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,869
opinions to make it you log in a

01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:19,920
different yeah you know I used to have

01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:23,070
this set up but um and I think the the

01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,829
question the thing is that you can add

01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:30,250
another person here so you're sort of

01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:31,960
referencing air even I do that but um

01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,640
I also will just love having the

01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,290
separate browsers and it reminds me to

01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,450
open up canary and see what's broken

01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:40,450
because when I brow a lot of I do a lot

01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:43,330
of like react and JavaScript stuff and I

01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:44,920
always find issues in my approach I

01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,930
always try to use like Safari and

01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:49,720
Firefox in the canary version of Chrome

01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:51,790
for that reason but yeah definitely good

01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:58,750
I should probably set that up anyway it

01:10:51,790 --> 01:11:02,320
only takes like a few seconds to do yeah

01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:04,150
and then now we're contemplating on the

01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,290
github error that we all saw to you as

01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:10,000
well yeah yeah that's a it is the thing

01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,410
it is the thing that I find because

01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,860
we're it's a ruby on rails app which is

01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:17,080
github calm and they use turbo links and

01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,970
I find that I've never been event at

01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,130
turbo links cuz I prefer to use a

01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:23,710
client-side JavaScript thing would do

01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:26,080
that but sometimes you find that you had

01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:27,690
the hard refresh to get updates on the

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,830
site and I think that was a the inverse

01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:33,310
but I'm happy to talk about that with a

01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:35,710
team yeah get ups made by it's all Ruby

01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:38,620
on Rails and very light JavaScript we

01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:40,360
actually had a apologies uh let's just

01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,890
talk about this real quick we actually

01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,650
removed all the jQuery from the site so

01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:49,990
get-ups been around since 2000 in the

01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:54,790
2007 now April 2008 yeah April 2008 is

01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:57,610
when it started its gonna blog jQuery

01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:58,900
but when I first joined we actually did

01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:01,300
a little project where we moved all the

01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:03,640
jQuery from a site so now what you're

01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,830
looking at is very simplistic JavaScript

01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,870
and a lot of complicated Ruby on Rails

01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:10,630
built a bunch of other frameworks like

01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:20,260
which not just like we're a large large

01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:21,880
project so true no comment um yeah but

01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,380
it's or a large project so obviously

01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,420
it's not just Ruby on Rails like could

01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:27,640
you have like go in Java and other

01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:34,300
services that power what you see on the

01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:35,200
page but we we have a lot of like yeah

01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:39,730
we just have a lot of infrastructure

01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:42,820
like we're a one of a lot of users all

01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:44,660
right so I've got on a very meandering

01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:47,090
tangent hopefully all this was been hell

01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:50,870
full again like all this content could

01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:52,820
be done asynchronously on your own pace

01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:55,010
but I did want to go ahead and explain

01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:56,930
and as questions come up like you do

01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:58,460
have me as a resource if you want more

01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:00,050
details of like github and get up

01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:02,420
actions so hopefully you've gotten them

01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:03,890
I did realize that there we didn't talk

01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:07,610
about the difference between CI in

01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:09,290
actions which it's not really different

01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:11,330
because you do see I would actions which

01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:12,530
we'll talk about but we didn't talk

01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:16,400
about github apps to you as well I

01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:19,100
didn't realize we didn't cover that but

01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,930
what I want to do is introduce part two

01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,850
and then while part two is being done I

01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:24,950
can explain github apps as well so you

01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:26,720
can like listen and then essentially

01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:29,660
copy and paste is what going to be doing

01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,940
so and none of this yeah none of this is

01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,380
gonna be any heavy coating I didn't

01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,870
really say that up front to I know we

01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:39,650
had one person asking about it being

01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:40,850
beginner friendly but yeah the whole

01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:43,190
time while we're in here we're just we

01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,430
copy and pasting as well as you're more

01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:49,070
than welcome to discontinue like looking

01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:51,740
at the listen to me talk and looking at

01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:56,330
my my pictures that my wife took

01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:58,490
actually this is that's me that was me

01:13:56,330 --> 01:14:02,480
uh ten years ago

01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:07,670
no yeah ten years ago my wife takes

01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:13,160
pictures with that camera ironically all

01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:15,770
right cool oh yeah introduction man

01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:18,020
tangents alright so what I want you to

01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,760
do is read through as I as I also talked

01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,500
while give me a break to you can listen

01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:24,860
or so you can read without me talking in

01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:28,100
your ear but uh I want you to go ahead

01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:29,750
and add this entire yamo file to the

01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,440
same project we just opened so that

01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:34,970
hello world project add this yellow file

01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:37,460
should be like mad mad lib dot yeah mo

01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:41,880
if that's not clear and it should be in

01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:44,710
your github that workflows folder

01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,300
so give me a thumbs up if you can hear

01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:48,760
that trumpet outside I've a very I'm on

01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:50,350
a very busy street in Oakland so we get

01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,150
like we just had street sweeping earlier

01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:55,480
now we have trumpet right outside my

01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:57,040
door so it's like it's awesome

01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,580
background music while you're coding for

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,889
sure yeah so anyway

01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,739
go to hell world your repo copy and

01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:10,030
paste this yamo file and then from there

01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:12,850
we will we will proceed and then I will

01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:14,290
give you 60 seconds of me not talking so

01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:16,239
that way you can concentrate on copy and

01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:19,590
pasting and I'll explain github apps and

01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,590
getup actions in a moment

01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,860
cool so now should always give you a

01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:14,929
head start with a copy and pasting also

01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:19,489
I realize I have a note about Wi-Fi but

01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:20,510
we're not in the same room so what was I

01:16:19,489 --> 01:16:22,630
gonna say Oh

01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:25,909
github actions and getup app so I

01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:28,190
preface this conversation this workshop

01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:30,860
with how github was working on a bunch

01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:33,199
of different primitives this permit this

01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,929
whole like primitive workflow and tour

01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,219
through like building a better API

01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:40,159
building a better authentication layer J

01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:42,460
WTS buildings better interactions with

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:46,880
web hooks like all those combinations

01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:49,880
into workflow automation was originally

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:52,190
like slated for github apps and then

01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,750
what we found was like a lot of people

01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,130
want to use github apps because they

01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,290
want to have tight integration in

01:16:55,130 --> 01:17:00,080
automation on to their repos and their

01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:01,730
companies but then sometimes people just

01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,820
want to do something super trivial like

01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:07,210
a hello world or what you're working on

01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,260
what's the matte lip like that does not

01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,550
what happens with github apps is you

01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,739
have to bring your own infrastructure

01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,989
and you have to host your own servers to

01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:16,760
make your get up apps work now you can

01:17:14,989 --> 01:17:18,469
definitely use like service functions to

01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,810
power everything but then that's that

01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:23,330
bar of entry to automate things in your

01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:25,250
workflow was this super hefty and took a

01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,810
lot of work so github app still exists

01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,580
and there's still a great way for you to

01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:31,100
automate your projects especially if you

01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:33,080
work in like an enterprise getup

01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:35,120
enterprise or something different but a

01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,219
whole another platform like get lab or

01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,250
bitbucket like those are all really

01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:42,730
great paths to do automation in your

01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:45,110
clothes but would get up actions

01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:46,790
everything is given to you by default so

01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:50,929
all you have to know is how to be able

01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:53,409
flags and to also follow good

01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:54,829
instructions when you have notes about

01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:59,059
let me close

01:17:54,829 --> 01:18:05,329
these taps notes about um too many tabs

01:17:59,059 --> 01:18:07,070
too many tabs excellent so when you have

01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:09,229
a note about like something not working

01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:11,839
the other cool thing is that actions so

01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:15,760
I already have an ammo file but if I

01:18:11,839 --> 01:18:19,099
wanted to let's say instead of edited

01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:26,419
alright well maybe I'm wrong that you

01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:29,749
just autocomplete well I guess what they

01:18:26,419 --> 01:18:32,659
do do is give you uh errors if you have

01:18:29,749 --> 01:18:38,179
things like this extra caps but it used

01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:40,719
to give you a uh why am I thinking oh I

01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:47,089
know what it will do wait do we bat I

01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:49,159
wanted to switch this to oh maybe they

01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:51,229
got rid of that maybe was too buggy all

01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:55,309
right well we said like auto-completion

01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:57,199
on yeah well file when you edit it but

01:18:55,309 --> 01:18:58,849
apparently we don't have it anymore so I

01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,489
should probably ask about that before I

01:18:58,849 --> 01:19:03,530
start preaching about it so apologies

01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:05,659
you're seeing you seeing me sort of

01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,159
flounder at this point forget I even

01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,329
said that but what I'm saying is that

01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,589
you all you have to do is this

01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:11,959
copy-paste someone else if you have a

01:19:09,589 --> 01:19:13,309
file and you have automation previously

01:19:11,959 --> 01:19:14,749
a good have apps and currently again

01:19:13,309 --> 01:19:17,209
have apps it takes a little more effort

01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:19,189
if you want to copy somebody else data

01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:24,409
oh you haven't oh you know what maybe

01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:27,349
it's the canary version that's why I'm

01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:31,579
good to use untested version of the

01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:33,829
browser anyway like mike has it so

01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:37,189
everybody everybody asked Mike how that

01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:38,510
works anyway it's not it hopefully you

01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,800
guys understand what auto-completion I

01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:42,289
have to go through and create a whole

01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:45,409
nother edit file I don't know the

01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:50,769
browser but what I was getting it it's

01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:52,760
not clean yeah

01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:57,139
yes I'm not sure what's happening there

01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:59,929
but what I'm getting at is the actions

01:19:57,139 --> 01:20:02,329
is like a lower bar of entry to to do

01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:03,949
things is what we have with get up

01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:05,569
actions and the cool thing about it is

01:20:03,949 --> 01:20:08,330
that it's also powering a lot of other

01:20:05,569 --> 01:20:12,320
things so I think

01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:15,440
it's not on this browser we have this

01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,900
thing which is github.com slash hood

01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:21,580
spaces and everybody heard about this

01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,580
feature that we shipped last week

01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:28,630
oh you know what it is I had to turn on

01:20:25,179 --> 01:20:30,429
my staff tools so this is a this is

01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:32,559
great that this is being recorded but

01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:33,789
I'm not sure how much is it a lot to

01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:35,769
talk about but it's a public feature

01:20:33,789 --> 01:20:37,300
that I would love I've really wanted to

01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:40,030
talk about for the longest time which is

01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:42,460
called code spaces and what this is is

01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,980
you get a let me just go into this one

01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,809
you get an entire environment to write

01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:49,210
code directly in the browser on github

01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:50,769
and the way this is working is actually

01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:52,750
powered by actions so we're actually

01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:54,630
leveraging our feature to sort of do a

01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:58,119
hot swapping and getting stuff to work

01:20:54,630 --> 01:21:00,099
now this is a super I guess an alpha it

01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:02,889
was alpha up until last week it's a

01:21:00,099 --> 01:21:04,510
limited beta so it is a bit of a

01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:05,829
resource hog at the moment they're

01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:08,349
actually working on that and then we'll

01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:09,699
open up even broader it's probably the

01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:12,159
part I wasn't supposed to say out loud

01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:13,809
but yeah so now you can see it's setting

01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:16,239
up my project so I can actually edit my

01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:18,960
code directly in the browser super

01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:21,099
excited about this wall depth working

01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,980
the shout out that you could sign up

01:21:21,099 --> 01:21:26,190
with the beta here and I guess we'll

01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,480
start hopefully adding people in

01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:32,019
collection or Thea in a month but yeah

01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,050
that's what this is code spaces and it's

01:21:32,019 --> 01:21:39,190
exactly what my page looks like loading

01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:40,329
here we are here's my code but yeah what

01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,369
I was getting at is that's powered by

01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:47,829
get up actions

01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:49,480
well parts of it is alright so I've been

01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:52,900
rambling and talking because I was

01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:55,510
trying to give you time to work on this

01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:57,670
mad lib issue so the way I'm going to do

01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,349
this and the reason why I have everybody

01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:01,260
do it in the crap work as well which is

01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:07,530
in their example looks like someone's uh

01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:09,489
actually that's mine let's see it should

01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,900
the way it works it should be the last

01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:12,670
thing that someone updated I could

01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:14,199
actually see it so the reason why I have

01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:15,909
it ready on the work flow are sorry in

01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:18,519
the same org is it's easier for me to

01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:22,090
sort of pick on some people updating

01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:24,460
things and I think part to a thank you

01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:27,239
glitch girl finally not picking on a

01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,239
Jake

01:22:28,889 --> 01:22:32,310
yeah so you did a great job copy and

01:22:30,869 --> 01:22:35,730
pasting and that's exactly what I needed

01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:37,520
so that's the first step the next step

01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:40,530
would be just be opening up an issue and

01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,929
I want to I'm curious anybody has

01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:47,000
anybody open up an issue yet maybe just

01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:47,000
pop in your handle I can find it

01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:55,830
excellent thank you very much for

01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:57,480
volunteering I realized as I was going

01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,630
to people's repos I probably should have

01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:02,610
asked for it instead of uh put people on

01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:04,469
blast too as well so apologies for Jake

01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,570
and glitch girl if that was

01:23:04,469 --> 01:23:15,960
uncomfortable that was not my intention

01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:17,400
all right all right so I have a yeah so

01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,320
this is a little is a good of action

01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,060
that I wrote myself back when I was

01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,350
testing good of actions and sort of I

01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,790
think what a lot of people didn't say

01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:27,360
went straight to see I and I was like

01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:28,380
hold on let me try to let me try to

01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,850
build something that's outside of the

01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:31,980
box on the realm of what people are

01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,630
thinking and it's a reason why I built

01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,730
this action too as well because I use it

01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:40,010
in production for one of my project that

01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:42,270
get up so this is a mad lib if you are

01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:44,250
not familiar of mad libs

01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:45,239
these are like little it's like back

01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:47,310
when I was a kid to get what's a little

01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:49,230
book when you go on a like a long drive

01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:51,260
with your parents to a vacation or

01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:54,090
something or to your grandma's house and

01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:57,570
you fill in they tell you give me a noun

01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:59,460
give me an adjective give me a verb just

01:23:57,570 --> 01:24:01,679
give me that and then from there it'll

01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:05,699
create a constructor a story or a

01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:07,320
sentence so today today I was at this is

01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:09,389
what we doesn't were so we got today I

01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,980
saw a moldy I guess we didn't get

01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:13,590
written out I guess it now I'm broke a

01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:15,449
moldy adjective Fleur Kim

01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:18,929
jump in down and it's tree he went

01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:20,850
quickly through the large tunnel to his

01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:23,520
big table so yeah basically he just gets

01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:25,230
us non like sometimes they don't make

01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,260
any sense at first I thought I broke in

01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:29,550
then I notice the action updates yes

01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:32,550
obsidian actually issue is great it's

01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:37,619
cool yeah so by copying and pasting the

01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:39,309
actions here repo you automatically get

01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:41,139
this by

01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:42,579
you get the trigger sorry you don't even

01:24:41,139 --> 01:24:44,769
get a trigger so we're actually running

01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:48,010
it on issues so whatever the issue is

01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:49,780
opened which I'm surprised this work to

01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:52,149
because this is an older syntax like it

01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:55,749
should be it should actually look like

01:24:52,149 --> 01:25:05,709
this and if I updated if I thought about

01:24:55,749 --> 01:25:09,309
it I would update it be this instead so

01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:12,269
instead of should be opened like that

01:25:09,309 --> 01:25:15,550
but if I think about it I'll paint the

01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:19,059
template but anyway right now it opens

01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:21,069
any close issue open issue any edited

01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:25,260
it's gonna run regardless because we

01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:27,639
don't have any type of type flag on here

01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:28,809
which again the documentation will

01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:30,760
explain that better than I'm doing right

01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:32,769
now so I'm gonna have this bounce out of

01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,559
that but we are creating a new workflow

01:25:32,769 --> 01:25:37,899
that's running on Ubuntu for no reason

01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:40,089
we're also using another action which

01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:42,099
I'm gonna make a call out to that is

01:25:40,089 --> 01:25:44,859
existence which is really leveraged for

01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:47,189
CI also another thing that I wasn't sure

01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:50,679
about when I first wrote this example

01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:54,069
was this action will check out master so

01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:55,629
it's actually better to when doing CI if

01:25:54,069 --> 01:25:57,459
you're gonna run a pull request and

01:25:55,629 --> 01:25:59,679
check the test you want to check it on

01:25:57,459 --> 01:26:01,539
master because master is usually the

01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,769
branch that people work on your main

01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:03,550
branch could be a main branch it could

01:26:02,769 --> 01:26:05,199
be development

01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:07,659
it could be production that could be

01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:09,609
released but it's just gonna check out

01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:12,069
whatever branch you provided to I'm

01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:13,329
running this on master 2 because at the

01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:15,729
time that was the only one release it

01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:18,429
existed but we're up to V 2 now so I

01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:20,739
recommend use V 2 is V 2 you could

01:26:18,429 --> 01:26:26,050
actually pass in the branch should you

01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:29,019
looking for so I say all that because I

01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:30,489
we're the power this we're using my

01:26:29,019 --> 01:26:33,669
action which is called variables and

01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:38,019
markdown and the way that works is when

01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:39,129
you first open your issue and this is

01:26:38,019 --> 01:26:40,149
mean as testing out like there's

01:26:39,129 --> 01:26:42,309
probably a better way to do this so

01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:45,819
again variables in markdown is open

01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:50,199
source but I'm hoping at issue and your

01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:52,809
your repo and you add a bunch of looks

01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:55,059
like I did provide some

01:26:52,809 --> 01:26:56,469
I think I provided the variables to you

01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:58,690
by default to as well you can update

01:26:56,469 --> 01:27:00,130
them but I mean I did it because I also

01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,500
did that what the berry of entry and to

01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:04,929
know what grammar and types of words

01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:07,210
were I think that's why I did that to

01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:09,219
you as welcome anyone have I'm not great

01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:11,559
I'm not great at English so I just

01:27:09,219 --> 01:27:13,179
sorted this a cool good catch

01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:15,159
yeah I'm not great English I don't

01:27:13,179 --> 01:27:17,070
explain when a verb and a noun was I

01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:19,539
just wanted to get that to you for free

01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:21,070
but what I'm saying is that these little

01:27:19,539 --> 01:27:23,050
hammer bars that are inside the project

01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:25,510
I have a project that basically defines

01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:27,610
adjective 1 and then replaces that half

01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:31,869
replaces that and the first thing you

01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:34,840
see is that all these things have not

01:27:31,869 --> 01:27:39,250
been changed and the way this works is

01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:42,369
that the action gets run and it runs my

01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:43,960
variables and markdown action which is

01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:45,460
powered by another project which I also

01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,389
open-source sure is called marquee

01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,520
markdown and it changes out those those

01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:55,199
variables and replaces it so you can see

01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:57,130
variables markdowns running version 0.4

01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:59,679
also it's going to point out to you as

01:27:57,130 --> 01:28:01,300
well just the hammer the point home that

01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:04,090
this is all open source stuff that it's

01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:06,070
built on feel free to bring build your

01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:08,949
own or use mine probably build your own

01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:10,780
because mine's not great but bearable is

01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:14,710
and markdown is my this is my repo I've

01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:17,980
built and you can see my explaining on

01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:19,960
how it works you can see that my example

01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:21,639
which is a noun which is mother mark

01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:25,110
Whalberg attribution say hi to your

01:28:21,639 --> 01:28:28,210
mother it's a phrase that it gets said

01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:30,219
this is nothing but some simple Ruby

01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:31,809
code and like I'm not the best Ruby

01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:33,730
developer but at the time I wanted to

01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:36,130
write more Ruby because I had not right

01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:37,829
written Ruby in like two years so that's

01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:41,199
why all these examples are in Ruby

01:28:37,829 --> 01:28:44,289
actually write a ton more JavaScript but

01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:45,639
you can see here that this action the

01:28:44,289 --> 01:28:47,289
code that powers is action you can

01:28:45,639 --> 01:28:49,539
actually read and clearly see what's

01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:52,030
going on if it isn't clear I do have

01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:53,559
some comments to help with that and if

01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:56,050
there's any if anybody else is it's not

01:28:53,559 --> 01:28:57,369
really confused on how this works I'm

01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:58,630
happy to explain it to you as well I had

01:28:57,369 --> 01:29:00,969
a whole conference talk that got

01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:03,460
canceled that was gonna explain marking

01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:05,380
markdown in transformer which was a pun

01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,280
I say all that because I wanted to show

01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:08,620
you my pun that I

01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:12,370
which is the marquee markdown actually

01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:16,300
transforms the transformer it's a Mark

01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:18,850
Wahlberg joke sorry if that sort of did

01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:21,220
that land alright so I say all that

01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:23,980
because by the time I come back here you

01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:27,490
can see all my the comment was updated

01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:31,270
by the github action spot right here and

01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:33,760
no one else did that except the Box the

01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:35,350
bots are here transformers sounds like

01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,850
it's transformer alright sorry these are

01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:38,800
bad jokes he's probably hitting much

01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:43,720
better and if I was in a room and I can

01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:46,270
hear you laughing yeah that's that's

01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:48,970
that's how I'd the tyrol it's like

01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:49,540
strong dad jokes that this don't ever

01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:52,570
give up

01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:55,090
alright yeah so that's how that works

01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:56,980
and any questions and variables and

01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:58,900
markdown I'm happy to answer them in the

01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:02,230
issues if it doesn't work I'm happy to

01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:04,930
look into why doesn't work and let's

01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:06,220
move on into part three so part three is

01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:09,460
going to be if you didn't look ahead

01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:12,930
part three our last part and we do have

01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:16,810
roughly what 25 minutes 26 minutes left

01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:19,180
so let me go to just want to point out

01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:21,010
to you as well the workshop folder is

01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:24,100
where all the parts are which is

01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:26,440
completed part three sorry part two

01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:27,960
we're going to part 3 part 4 is this

01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:31,120
bonus where we just sort of talk through

01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,440
which I think at this point a lot of

01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,210
this is going to be self-explanatory

01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:37,090
because it is copy and pasting and

01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:40,090
clicking buttons but what I want you to

01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:43,330
do is go to the see this template right

01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:45,430
here using the actually yeah they were

01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:46,870
yeah if you click that link you should

01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:48,130
be able to create a CI template so

01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,460
that's the next part if you haven't got

01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:54,580
there yet so click that link create a CI

01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:55,630
template make sure you're in the org it

01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,790
just gonna be a lot easier for me to

01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:59,590
find it later if you don't want to do in

01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:02,610
New York like in Oregon's fine take it

01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:02,610
home homework

01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:11,000
good catch so Roberto actually points

01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:13,400
out or some really good details and

01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,580
something I for some reason did not get

01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:18,320
to that but again I wrote those original

01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,489
tutorial back and the last time I gave

01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:24,260
this tutorial was knocked over the in

01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:25,790
the October we've had new versions okay

01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:30,170
sounds good

01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:32,630
we've had new versions so feel free to

01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:34,429
if you do get stuck there the the actual

01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:36,500
code that you're looking at might look

01:31:34,429 --> 01:31:38,960
different one of the biggest differences

01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:42,560
is the way we use the environment

01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:46,190
variables in width and node versions

01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,800
I believe that's changed actually I'll

01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:53,750
just work I'll walk through it myself

01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:57,619
along with everybody and then we can

01:31:53,750 --> 01:32:00,139
catch anything we only have yeah roughly

01:31:57,619 --> 01:32:01,159
15 minutes and then I'm happy to answer

01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:04,580
any questions so if anybody has any

01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:06,320
questions feel free to start actually

01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:09,199
question anything I can sort of cover

01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,790
while you have me I'm also do want to

01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:13,880
point out to you as well in case we do

01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:16,460
hit time I'll be Dougie on github and be

01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:22,489
dougie Oh on Twitter as well which I'll

01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:24,860
share that again once I'm done get out

01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:26,540
feel free to go along all along with me

01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:27,860
or just watch me do it but I'm gonna

01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,679
create a template which is based on the

01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:36,920
CI the next step that it's going to want

01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:41,119
you to do is pick a node.js template

01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:44,170
start a template I will address those

01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,040
security vulnerabilities sometime

01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:48,679
definitely pay attention to these things

01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,820
like don't use this in production they

01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:51,679
use my example in production because

01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:54,429
obviously you can see there's some high

01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:56,810
severity security vulnerabilities but I

01:32:54,429 --> 01:33:02,090
have no band what to fix it so I'm gonna

01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:03,739
mark those closed you can go to the

01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:06,159
actions tab which is the next step it's

01:33:03,739 --> 01:33:06,159
going to tell you

01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:16,320
you want to set up a nodejs workflow

01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:18,840
which I do want to point out too

01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,250
it knows like it knows that there's

01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,869
JavaScript in here and mainly it's

01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:25,860
because as a package that JSON in there

01:33:21,869 --> 01:33:27,929
if this was a dotnet core project this

01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:32,250
suggested section should say something

01:33:27,929 --> 01:33:33,420
dinette core and then I will also want

01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,590
to plant there are some other actions

01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,810
that you could sort of get your feet wet

01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:38,369
with as well so some of the other

01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:40,349
trivial things like steal bought and

01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:42,000
labor and greetings like saying hello

01:33:40,349 --> 01:33:45,330
when someone opens a issue for the first

01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,750
time in your project that's all some

01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:49,800
suggestions that you could use as well

01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:55,980
for now we're going to focus on the CI

01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:57,360
section now I wonder what is change yeah

01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:59,670
so one thing that has changed is that

01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,929
there's a virtual one up set up node so

01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:06,119
be I think before I might have been

01:34:00,929 --> 01:34:13,020
working off master no it actually still

01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:16,260
version one I don't know what was it

01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:18,719
Roberto for you know just for newer

01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:21,270
version in the workshop oh is it the

01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,679
node version yeah I don't know what

01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:24,420
actually has changed the only difference

01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:28,949
is that I could see is that we're not

01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:32,489
using a px because I think that X is

01:34:28,949 --> 01:34:33,810
actually falling out of support oh is v2

01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:36,389
Oh interesting

01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:37,860
oh well click the button and see what

01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:39,869
happens like if this is a copy and paste

01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:41,699
workshop so I copy and paste and we'll

01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:43,139
see what happens I'm gonna I'm gonna

01:34:41,699 --> 01:34:49,920
merge that to directly the master I

01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:51,750
could do a PR but no reason say I

01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:55,670
already have pull requests help me with

01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:55,670
those versions that fall out of favor

01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:02,900
okay

01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:05,580
oh yeah yeah so it mine just says push

01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:07,350
pull request is the second event that

01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:10,920
actually I did go ahead and accept and

01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:13,199
keep I forgot I was talking about the

01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:14,969
team about this and they originally only

01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:18,000
wanted push because they wanted other

01:35:14,969 --> 01:35:21,510
people to this to find out the workflows

01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,179
they wanted also some people complain

01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:26,580
because sometimes push actually I think

01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:28,679
we fixed that because push and pull

01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,790
requests are running both at the same

01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:31,380
time so every time you open up or

01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:33,810
request you get two actions running and

01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,360
since now we're actually charging you

01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:37,830
get three thousand minutes for free

01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,869
actually we haven't made that outside

01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:41,310
did we that's even a month we're gonna

01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:42,600
actually have a hard cap on how many

01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:44,310
limits how many minutes you have on

01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,690
actions which is three thousand minutes

01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:47,969
I think at the moment we don't have a

01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:49,710
limit for open-source but we sort of

01:35:47,969 --> 01:35:52,830
figured out through the beta whatever

01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:56,840
the limit is that's a good question

01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:59,159
Barry and I was that part for is that so

01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,860
what I'll do is actually just show off

01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:08,280
the CI and what I'll do is also talk

01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:12,540
through the rest of the stuff and in a

01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:14,670
month Ethan but the earlier the question

01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:16,830
and the the reason why I do CI at the

01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:20,219
end is because it's point and click and

01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:23,190
then it works so I just added CI and now

01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:24,710
I have my test running for note index

01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:27,300
and no.12

01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:32,190
both on seven separate actions and let

01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:42,860
me explain that to you as well let me

01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:45,000
explain that and work full so

01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:46,440
some of the stuff I was I was calling

01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,910
out in the chat but I wasn't actually

01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:49,890
looking at it so in case people were not

01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:51,990
kind of disjointed from what I'm saying

01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:54,270
and what's on the screen what I was

01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:56,370
talking about is that my example only

01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:59,430
has push and it's only pushing the

01:36:56,370 --> 01:37:01,530
branch master which doesn't make a huge

01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:03,330
difference because I don't think I'm

01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:05,220
calling off the branch either but I only

01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:07,320
want to have the action to run and it's

01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:09,060
only Phil ting on this branch I can do a

01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:10,650
comma and then add like BOP branch

01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:13,350
development branch whatever branch and

01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:15,270
make it short runs on those branches but

01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:17,280
I only wanted to run them the other

01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:19,410
thing I'm going to do is only run on

01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:23,580
poor quests on master so sometimes you

01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:25,590
run up yeah sometimes you want to run a

01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:27,480
pull request on and the reason I

01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:29,760
actually answer that insect sometimes

01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,960
you want to run your CI only on pull

01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,090
requests sometimes you want to run on

01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,940
multiple branches because you have a

01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:37,650
staging or a long long time release so

01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:39,510
that's where you sort of add these

01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:41,760
filters and we didn't really cover any

01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:44,310
of this previously other than the fact

01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,860
that I was also showing issues opened in

01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:48,390
the previous section it is pretty wordy

01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,760
because this is where I get the most

01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:52,770
questions that but also this is like the

01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,020
section that takes less time to run

01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:59,970
through so it is literally copying and

01:37:55,020 --> 01:38:02,130
pasting so this has been I would explain

01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:05,130
you can run different versions so Mac OS

01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:07,320
and windows the strategy is where you do

01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:10,610
the things like your matrix builds so if

01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:14,550
you want to run every single version yep

01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:16,290
3000 minutes per month yes correct

01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:18,120
if you want to learn every single

01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:21,150
version and you get more minutes if you

01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,200
pay if you're a paid user as well but if

01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:22,800
you wanted to run every single version

01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,560
of node

01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,360
I think earliest by default earliest I

01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,150
think we have which is like an open

01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:34,410
community issue is like something in

01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:36,840
this node 3 version and it's not because

01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:38,220
we don't respect older versions node

01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,260
it's because we haven't had a need to

01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:43,380
add other versions a node until very

01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:44,910
recently no one's asked for them but I'm

01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,980
also going to call out to as well github

01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:48,540
community forum a lot of the actions

01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:50,460
teams and the PMS they hang out in the

01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:53,550
forum so if you have specific questions

01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:55,320
on your use case or minutes and what it

01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,040
looks like feel free to ask a question

01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,900
here or

01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:00,030
find the answer as well so obviously

01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:02,550
they may be sorry I shouldn't say

01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:05,640
obviously but the green checkmarks is

01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:07,290
what have been answered questions so if

01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,640
you happen to find something so there's

01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:11,070
a specific question on self-hosted

01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:18,410
runners which I will not cover you can

01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:20,670
find it there let's go back to my here

01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:22,710
call-out that amusing be to simply

01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:25,820
previously I was using I was only using

01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:28,260
master which is still v2 and then some

01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:30,330
which could be dangerous another the

01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:32,520
Karin Erik Canary thing I'm using an

01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:35,640
environment variable to grab the matrix

01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:36,900
in the version this strategy flag is you

01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:39,450
can do some creative and clever things

01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:43,170
or strategy like running specific docker

01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:44,430
containers for just that one action I so

01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:46,920
you do other clever things like that

01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:48,450
which I experimented with but don't

01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,610
really have any good examples of when he

01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,900
would use that my only example is I have

01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:54,060
a Ruby on Rails project and I can't

01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:55,710
share that has to run under a specific

01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:58,470
version of Postgres so I'm doing some

01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:59,970
clever things with that but the

01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:01,980
documentation in the form will help you

01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:04,050
if you have a something specific to use

01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:05,460
case and also highly recommend that if

01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,870
you want to go to the open source repo

01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,610
and check that out

01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:12,180
some open source repo so you have some

01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:14,790
clever ways to do to run actions one

01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:17,570
that I every time I open up it's it

01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:17,570
doesn't actually open

01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:25,030
doesn't actually go to my Romney bar up

01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:28,290
there I want to say oh it's like I'm not

01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:30,700
using any clever unless sir

01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:32,320
I've been talking to Wesley from the

01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:33,220
expression AS team so I thought they

01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,420
they would head that some actions

01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:39,250
because I talked about actions all the

01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:43,510
time no purse not a project perhaps

01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:44,260
babble that's an actions folder so if

01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:46,270
you just want to see like another

01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:48,250
project that you can actually just look

01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:50,560
up their actions to as well which are

01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:52,720
all open source so Babel has a bunch of

01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,400
actions were they so I showed you how to

01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:57,940
do an action by pointing to in the

01:40:54,400 --> 01:41:01,120
folder directory you also to actually by

01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,290
using a third party action but babble is

01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,570
actually using actions by putting them

01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:05,800
in a specific folder and then running it

01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:08,350
from there so very similar the way you

01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,360
would approach like doing well by using

01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:14,940
babble they actually shove everything in

01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:17,500
folders as well I also failed to mention

01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:21,340
github marketplace to you as well so I

01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:22,870
just want to give a quick call out the

01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,490
fact that you can find other actions oh

01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:30,000
I did mention it but I mentioned it

01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:30,000
briefly in the context of the docs tab

01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:36,040
so if you want to find other actions

01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:37,180
apologies I like a ton of time that I

01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,690
could have finished with and like like

01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:42,460
when I'm tangent and forgot to finish

01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:43,900
but there's like 3,500 actions we've had

01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,640
a hundred action since last week because

01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,160
I had this page up last week last

01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:50,110
Wednesday and we've got 100 interactions

01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,400
since then but if you want to find an

01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:55,960
action specific the use case and maybe

01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:58,870
someone's a bill also check their excuse

01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:01,270
me I don't yeah if you're familiar of

01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:03,640
NPM this will look familiar if you

01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:06,430
aren't apologies I don't have time to

01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:08,500
explain how NPM works but this is

01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:09,730
basically building your project if you

01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:12,010
do have a build command that's what this

01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:15,370
if present flag is and then it's running

01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:18,430
NPM tests and this is actually built an

01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:21,130
NPM the project not built in action so

01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:24,760
everywhere you see a run flag or a run

01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:27,700
task you're running that in bash

01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:32,110
because bash has an Ubuntu I believe the

01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:33,970
windows it might still be still bash

01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:35,890
but don't quote me on that because I

01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:38,980
don't use a lot of windows so I sailed

01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:41,770
that and I will wrap up because all this

01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:42,910
content is available to you available

01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:44,950
through this does this pretty

01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:45,520
long-winded it sort of walks through CI

01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:48,520
template

01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:51,880
some people have caught some older

01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:55,600
content here so please open up PR if you

01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:57,460
have places we can improve this I do

01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:59,380
walk into like right now there's no test

01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:02,590
in your project so you can copy and

01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:05,680
paste your test you can then mess around

01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:07,930
the builds so we do have a I build that

01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,060
works so if you want to have a build

01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:12,850
build version of your project into a

01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:14,560
dist dist folder it also works we also

01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:16,030
use another action from marketplace

01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,070
which I would explained if I had more

01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:20,080
time which is formatting your node code

01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:22,590
so imagine everybody writes their node

01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:24,640
code with either single or double quotes

01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:27,430
you can actually have a formatted tool

01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:29,190
to see is prettier to enforce the single

01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:32,170
formatting and what it does is actually

01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:36,250
the action itself just like we have seen

01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:38,620
so far it commits directly to your PR

01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:39,790
for you which is great if you have a

01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:42,190
project that you still want to explain

01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:43,930
the benefits of single quotes for system

01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:45,360
double quotes if there is I'm not sure

01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:47,890
if there's actually benefits for that

01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,720
another one which is going to answer

01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:52,720
your question my my favorite action

01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:54,760
which is auto publisher release this

01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:57,040
actually writes drafts up or releases

01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,630
for you which look like this without you

01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,030
needing to do it yourself so every time

01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:02,620
you push a project you merge a project

01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:04,750
in the master any kind of release

01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:06,760
everything that's pushed to master since

01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:09,610
the last release will be auto add into a

01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:11,410
draft Pete release and that sort of

01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:13,000
explains that and then finally publish

01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:15,430
an NPM which is gonna change in the

01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,920
future but if you want to do it I get a

01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:21,060
very naive way that I did you can copy

01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:24,160

01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:27,100

happening

01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:55,330
but don't tell Microsoft I'm doing this

01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:57,640
here for free without you needing to pay

01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:58,510
I say I think that conference is free

01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,120

morning I was system some some of the

01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:36,880
closing words later I'm a big fan of

01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:38,380
open source and I love having

01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,450
opportunity for people to build things

01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:42,490
to have an introduction so if you have

01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:47,860
an action that you would like to share

01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:50,310
please open-source it I did not mention

01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:53,620
this actions hackathon we did last month

01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:55,210
but essentially there's a bunch of other

01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:56,680
actions that people built like

01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:59,350
yourselves that just threw those out

01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,610
there so definitely not for the purpose

01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:01,780
of participant hackathon because it's

01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:04,050
over but if you're looking for more

01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:06,460
actions that are not on marketplace

01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:08,050
highly recommend checking out that if

01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:09,940
you want to sort of expand your brain on

01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:13,960
ways you can improve your developer

01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:15,940
