Abstract: How will we know it works? Just test it? Test what? it?

When working in tech it's common to hear  that "we should test things", "we don't want bugs", and ever more common "just automate it". Though what is "it"? How does one decide what is worth testing and what is not and what conditions to test under. In this talk we'll walk through what makes a good test and how to determine what is worth testing to drive value and achieve the high quality software we all aim to deliver. 

Whether you're a product manager, developer, qa/test engineer this talk is for you.
