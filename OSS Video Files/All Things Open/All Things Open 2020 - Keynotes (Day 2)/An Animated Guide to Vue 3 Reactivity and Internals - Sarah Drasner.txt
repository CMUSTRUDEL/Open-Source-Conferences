Abstract: There is a lot of talk about Reactivity in the frontend landscape of late, but what is it? And how does Vue use reactive premises to manage state in an application? In this talk, we'll go over what reactivity is in general, and how that applies to the upcoming changes in Vue 3. We'll cover proxies, the virtual DOM, and watchers along the way.
