Abstract: For those who are underrepresented in tech, navigating code reviews can be hard. For example, a study of Github code reviews show that people are much more critical of code when they know itâ€™s submitted by a woman. Software Architect, Angie Jones, will share the 10 guidelines she follows for navigating code reviews, which have worked for every code base she has contributed to. These practical tips will help lead to a productive process that will help you get your code accepted faster, and without the drama.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
good morning

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,000
everyone or good evening depending on

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,040
where you are so i have a question for

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
you

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,199
have you ever gone on this roller

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
coaster ride

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
where you pour your heart and soul into

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
your cold

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,359
you feel really proud of yourself once

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
you're done

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,599
you submitted for code review

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,960
only to be met with comments that are

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:39,840
harsh blunt and sometimes downright rude

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
yep so many of us can relate to this

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
deflating experience right

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
the fact of the matter is that co

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
reviews are a form of feedback

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
but they often lack that thoughtfulness

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,840
that would be exercised if critiquing

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
someone on say

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,079
anything else and trying to make

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
every code reviewer be polite and

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,040
thoughtful

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,400
it's just a feat i simply don't have

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,840
the energy to take on and i realized

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,280
long ago that i can't change people's

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
actions

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,880
but i do have control over my

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
reactions so i've taken a different

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
approach

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
and it's worked marvelously on every

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
team i've

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
been on

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,320
okay sorry i get to my slides right

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,759
so with this approach that's what i'm

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
going to present to you

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,119
it's my ten commandments of navigating

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,960
code reviews first one

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,840
thou shall not take it personally

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
so you can get nasty review comments for

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,560
various reasons and

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,360
let's be honest and state the obvious

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
some people are just jerks right

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,040
but some people they may lack the social

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,160
skills to be able to give

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,759
feedback in a constructive way some

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,319
people they thrive on

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,920
power and you know they get off on

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,200
having that authority to

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,879
say ship or no ship some people they

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
pride themselves on

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,640
being brutally honest and they don't

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
want to go that extra mile

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,720
to soften messages and

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,120
some people have biases that color the

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,400
way that they see you

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,400
a study of github code reviews show that

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
people are way more critical when they

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,000
know it's submitted by a woman

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,560
and trust me as a black female

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
programmer i've certainly gotten my fair

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
share of rude and patronizing comments

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,959
when

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
joining a new team whether it be

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,920
corporate or open source

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
but wondering if i'm getting this

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,519
comment because i'm a woman

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
or because i'm black or because of some

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,200
combination of both

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
is only going to stress me out and i

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,239
imagine

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
other underrepresented demographics may

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,000
have these same thoughts and i know a

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,000
lot of junior developers who do

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,040
as well but here's the thing

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,440
dwelling on why you're getting

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,560
rude code review messages and my opinion

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,360
is a waste of time and energy and you'll

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,519
only become further frustrated

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
now don't get me wrong this sort of

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
treatment is in

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,480
no way cool or acceptable but i

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,080
also don't think fighting each of these

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,239
reviewers head on

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
will result in the change that we want

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,400
to see

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,319
so to save my own sanity

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,280
i give every reviewer the benefit of the

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,040
doubt

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
and assume that their comment is

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,920
directed to the code

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,920
and not me

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
now one way to avoid taking things

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,200
personally

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,040
is to not become married to the code

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,519
take that ring off okay now i know

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,200
how much of ourselves we invest into the

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,720
code that we write and

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
that passion is great but if you truly

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
want to commit

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,199
the best solution possible

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
you have to be willing to accept that

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,840
maybe the best solution

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,400
is not the initial one you submitted

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,240
let's look at an example

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
here's an exchange in a given code

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
review

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
so it says this is complex for no good

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,120
reason you don't have to show off

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,040
less is more in the submitter replies

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
this is not me showing off it's a

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
complex problem and thus warren's a

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
complex solution

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,440
well it says you can accomplish this

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
same thing with a single while loop

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
and they say my solution works just as

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,080
well you know

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,639
i really worked hard on this sad face

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
emoji

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,520
now let's take a step back here when

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,080
someone looks at this

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,199
you the submitter are the one who looks

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,000
emotional

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
and defensive the rudeness of the

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
reviewers comments

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
is overshadowed by the submitter's

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,400
attachment

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,320
to that original solution now once

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
you've learned to detach yourself it

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,960
becomes a lot easier

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
to actually hear what the reviewers are

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,639
trying to say

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,039
right so you will avoid going through

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
the torture in your head of

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
why are they being mean to me is it

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,080
because

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,639
i'm filling the blank and i can't tell

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
you

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
how much stress this helps avoid because

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,840
now you can read past the bluntness

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
of the comment and you can see the

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,759
points that they're trying to make

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,720
and now you're free to truly consider it

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,240
is what they're suggesting actually a

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,840
better solution

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
if it is thank them and make the change

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,479
so when the reviewer says that you can

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
accomplish the same thing with a single

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,440
loop

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,479
the submitter says good point that would

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,960
be cleaner

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
and remove some of the complexity let me

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,800
work this thank you

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
now doesn't that sound so much better

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,560
now having said that let me acknowledge

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,600
that

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,919
more times than not you probably do

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
have the most optimal solution to the

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,520
problem you're solving

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
right so when someone suggests that you

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
should change your code

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,639
don't automatically assume that the

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
person is right

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
you worked on this for hours maybe days

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,919
and the reviewer is just kind of

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,880
throwing ideas out there after they're

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,199
seeing it for only a couple of minutes

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
so

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
consider the reviewer's suggestion if

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,160
you haven't already

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,120
but if yours is better articulate

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
why and do it right there in the cold

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
review because you want

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,280
all the other reviewers to also know how

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
thorough you are

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,599
so the convo could go something like you

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
could accomplish the same thing with a

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,160
single while loop

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,840
and you reply yeah you know i initially

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
thought the same thing

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
but i have to also iterate through this

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
list

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,720
that led me to this solution which

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,080
handles all cases

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,080
look at that now let me tell you i've

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,599
seen the rudest people

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,960
change their tone after i make such a

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
statement

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,879
and i've now earned their respect and

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
i've proven

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,160
that i'm just as smart as they are

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,720
because i originally had that same idea

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,560
and you know what i might even be a

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
little bit smarter because i've

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,280
considered something that they haven't

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
so this is a sure way to get people to

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,879
ease off

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,599
in future reviews because they now trust

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,199
that you know what you're doing

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,960
now let's say that you've considered

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
their recommendation

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
and you know that's not the best

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,759
solution but

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
they don't think that your solution is

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,560
the best either

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,039
what do you do well you don't get into a

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,680
heated back and forth exchange

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,680
you know after a few messages if you

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
can't come to an agreement

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
it's time to step away from the code

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,279
review and offer to collaborate

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,159
offline on the solution so the exchange

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,120
could go

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,360
something like you know well there has

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,680
to be a simpler approach to this

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
and then you say something like you know

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,240
i'm all for the simplest approach

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
possible

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,120
let me find some time on your calendar

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,360
so that we can whiteboard it out

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
you didn't crumble you know and just

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,360
take their solution

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,480
you also didn't get emotional because

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,040
you are not married to this cold

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,000
and people will appreciate and respect

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,959
both of these qualities

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,959
number six thou shalt contribute to

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,120
others co-reviews

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,200
now if you're always the submitter and

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
never the reviewer you're going to be

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,279
perceived

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
as more junior than you probably are and

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,800
think about it

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,760
the people who are most respected on the

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
projects

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,240
or who the ones who are frequently

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,399
reviewing other people's code

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
and it doesn't matter if the submitter

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,839
is more senior than you

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,240
are even better right think about how

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
powerful you become when you're able to

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
help them see

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
something that they didn't before or you

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,320
introduced them to

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,760
some new technique this is instant dev

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
cred

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,560
it also allows you to see other coding

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,839
styles and techniques

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,800
which in turn can make you a stronger

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
programmer

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,720
and more knowledgeable about the code

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,720
base that you're contributing to

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
number seven thou shalt treat submitters

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,760
how thou

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,680
wants to be treated now when you're

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,040
reviewing code remember

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,160
not to take on the same attitudes

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,640
that you despise just because someone is

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
brutal and leaving comments for you

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
doesn't mean

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
you have to stoop to that level and i

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
know that this sounds

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,600
obvious but listen i've witnessed

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,600
levels of pettiness that adults simply

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
should not possess

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
if someone just ripped you apart in the

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,079
code review

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,839
yeah it's tempting to return a favor

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
when you see one of their pull requests

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,079
come through but don't do it

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
be the bigger person and stay true to

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,200
who you are

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
comment on that review the same way you

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,399
would like others to comment on yours

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,160
and who knows maybe your charm and

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,600
professionalism will rub off

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,480
on them number eight thou

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,480
shall not be intimidated by the number

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
of comments

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,800
i know that it's super easy to feel like

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,120
a total amateur when

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
you have a review with tons of comments

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
right and things get even worse when

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
there's

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,079
multiple people making multiple comments

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
and i'm not gonna lie to you uh this

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,480
doesn't look great

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
but don't count yourself out remember

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,720
it's code

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
don't take it personally right so

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,480
if you're new to the project or it's a

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,680
new language or a new framework or a new

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
library

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,880
simply chalk it up to a learning

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,839
opportunity

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,720
go through each of the comments review

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
them

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
defend the solutions that you believe

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
are right

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
except the ones that are better but the

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
key here

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
is to communicate so i had to do a

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
project in

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,360
swift once and i'd never used that

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,200
language before

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,839
and my first few submissions were

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,079
riddled with code review comments

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,639
even from people who were junior to me

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,959
and that stings right

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
but i was new to the company as well so

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,760
i hadn't yet

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,079
established a reputation with this team

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
and it became crucial to me that i

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
didn't become

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
labeled as this emotional woman who

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
doesn't know what she's doing right

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,920
so i had to explain my rationale but

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,480
in a non-defensive way so the review

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,040
went something like this

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,200
the reviewer asked why didn't you just

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,000
make the functions argument optional and

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,560
set it to a default value

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,480
and i say oh wow that's pretty cool we

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
don't have that option in java

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
which is the language that you know i

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
rock so

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
uh you know i said i'll make this change

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,079
and read a bit more about it as well

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,360
so this shows you're grateful for their

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
help you're not

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
dumb you know you just are used to

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,839
another language

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,920
and more importantly you are willing to

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,120
learn

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,360
number nine thou shall not repeat the

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,079
same mistakes this is a big one

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
pay attention all right because nothing

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,279
annoys reviewers more

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
than having to tell a person the same

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
thing

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
over and over again and i've seen cold

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,200
reviews become

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,639
nastier and nastier when this happens

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
now when you accept someone's

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,279
recommendation and you make the change

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,519
take a moment and internalize why

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
you accepted the recommendation because

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
there's a lesson in there

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
and this goes back to making sure you're

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
not blindly accepting recommendations

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,920
just to get people off your back

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,680
and get your pull requests accepted if

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,639
you're doing this

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
you may not be processing the why and

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,360
the why is the lesson

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,440
and once you understand why you're not

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
likely to make that same mistake in the

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
future

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
so if the reviewers are not explaining

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
why

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,160
they are giving you this recommendation

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
ask them

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,480
you know and when you're reviewing other

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
people's code

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
always provide rationale with your

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,160
recommendation

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,480
that helps it stick better okay now

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,279
whenever viewer tells you something once

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,519
and you immediately start incorporating

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
it

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,240
into your future submissions people

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
realize you're sharp

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
and they only have to tell you something

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
one time and you get it

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,160
they have no choice but to respect that

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
and the final commandment is to embrace

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,800
the knits

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
so there are people who seem like major

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
knit pickers

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,720
if you don't know any it's probably you

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,199
right

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,760
um and their only comments to you are

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,560
about

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,720
misspellings and other trivial things

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,639
that the linter didn't catch

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,040
if you've gotten to this point

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,440
congratulations

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,560
you've actually managed to write code

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
that your team has no problem with

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,000
fundamentally

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,920
remember don't take it personally don't

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
roll your eyes and say

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,959
such and such always has to say

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
something

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,720
such and such probably respects your

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,760
work and just has an

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,320
eagle eye fix the stupid typo

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,360
keep it moving all right so there you

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,279
have it folks

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,160
these are the ten commandments

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
and it's the gospel according to angie i

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,600
keep them with me

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,920
on every team that i work with and

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,959
they've not failed me yet they've helped

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,959
me to go

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
from newbie contributor to

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,079
well-respected contributor

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,199
in a matter of a couple of weeks so i

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:50,880
hope that they work

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:50,880
