Presented at All Things Open 2020 Keynotes (Day 2)

Abstract: The future of work is changing. As the work-from-home model becomes the norm and work becomes more broadly distributed, more applications, systems, and infrastructures are more vulnerable than ever.

At the same time, cybersecurity is a $100 billion market that's wasting resources and frustrating customers with inadequate protection. We need security designed into products, not applied on top of them. We need ubiquitous security, not just on the perimeter. We need openness and collaboration. And we need to make security the responsibility of everyone, not just the CISO and their team. If we don't learn from the breaches of the past, they will continue to increase in size and frequency, slowing down society, harming companies and consumers. In this talk, Marten Mickos presents a vision for a world where everyone is diligent about cybersecurity and thereby the total cost of it goes down, not up.

thank you

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,280
thanks for the very warm welcome here to

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,440
all things open

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,160
my name is martin mikus i'm the ceo of

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,359
hakka one and i'm here to talk about

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
software and security because today

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
we used to be able to develop software

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,439
without ever thinking of security

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
information security or cyber security

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
but today there's no software you can

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
develop without having to think about

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
how to make it

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
trustworthy how to make the software

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
secure so that's what i'm talking about

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,480
today

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,520
and let me share my screen here

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,600
i have to find my slides there we go

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
share and

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
so as i said there's no coding anymore

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
that doesn't involve

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
an aspect of security whatever we're

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399
building for ourselves or for somebody

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
else

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
for public use or not we must make sure

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,600
it's as secure as possible to

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,119
reduce the risk of cyber breaches

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,040
disruptions

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
any kind of cyber crime that may happen

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
and i'm martin mikus i'm ceo of hakka

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
one i was previously

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,040
previously ceo of mysql and we learned

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
back then about open source that

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
in open source some people spend an

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,320
awful lot of time

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
in order to save money and they are

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,600
users and some

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
spend a lot of money in order to save

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,280
time and they become customers

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,799
so there was this division into two

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
different types of of

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,320
users in open source in security

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
it's a little bit different everybody

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
have to has to spend money

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,399
everybody has to spend time cyber

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
security or information security or just

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,159
security

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,119
will not work if we not everybody is

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,280
participating

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
it's everybody's duty everybody is

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,880
spending a little bit of money

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
and some time to make sure that we reach

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,399
the cyber hygiene

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
that will keep our systems safe and

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
trustworthy

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,680
because when our systems are not

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,920
trustworthy we get all kinds of societal

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
side effects and bad problems in in

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,280
society that seem to not

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
relate to software but they do relate to

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,239
software when people can't trust the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
software they are using

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,000
so what is then security some people

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
have been thinking that security is

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
about making sure

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,879
nothing bad ever happens but there is no

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
absolute level of security there's no

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,520
place where

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,599
cyber risk is zero it is in

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,080
the practice of information security is

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
probabilistic risk management

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
you think about the probability of

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
something bad happen

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
happening and you're trying to reduce

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
the likelihood of it

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
so you're looking for the most

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,800
economical way of reducing the odds of a

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
cyber breach

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
like how can you make the cost for a

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,360
criminal go up as high as possible

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
how can you make the likelihood that

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
your own employees will make a mistake

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
as low as possible

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,599
and every day you work on those

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
likelihoods there's those

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
percentages and try to drive them down

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
they will never reach the zero

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
but if you think they can go to xero you

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,879
are already wrong

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,440
it's just an uh everlasting

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,560
practice of reducing the risk step by

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
step by step

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
and it starts from when you develop

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,440
software see when you

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
design software you have to design

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,680
security in from the start

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
and we used to never do that at mysql we

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
developed the fastest

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
most lovable database of the world we

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
didn't think much about security

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
we thought about thought about

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
performance robustness ease of use and

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,239
things like that

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
but today everything needs to be secure

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
so where we have csos leading the

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
security

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
work in a company what does the c really

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
stand for

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,080
and of course we know it stands for

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
chief but

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
there are two schools that we are seeing

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,480
there's the commanding

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
information security officer and the

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,799
collaborative one

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,799
and it's clear that in the past we had a

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
practice all over the world of thinking

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,799
that security was something where

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,959
you had one person in charge of a small

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
group who had unlimited authority to

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
block anything stop anything

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,000
command anything and the others didn't

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
worry

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,439
but you cannot outsource security it has

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,919
to be everybody's responsibility

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
so let's look more closely at it in the

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,759
in the old school

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,759
the main principle of cyber security was

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
that it's closed it's confidential

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
it's exclusive it's just a small group

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
of certified professionals who will even

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,720
know what cybersecurity is

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
but in the new world we are saying no

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
it's open it has to be open

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
it has to be inclusive so that everybody

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,919
can participate

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
and we have to be transparent about both

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
the problems and the solutions

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
we have to be transparent with what went

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
wrong and how we fixed it and what we

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
are learning

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
and when you look at this as an open

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,400
source developer you will say

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
hey but that's exactly how we do it in

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
the open source software

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
and that is so true so what hacker one

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,320
is doing in security

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
is what open source did to software

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
development

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
bringing in a model where you are open

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
you're transparent

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,320
you're inclusive you're collaborative

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
and you work together with people

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,919
you work together with people you

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
disagree with but you work together with

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
them

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,160
and the goal in this new model is the

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,960
reduction of cyber risk

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,639
but in the traditional model the goal

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,639
was

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,199
impenetrability thought that you can

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
build an

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,720
absolute defense on your perimeter and

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
they were trying to reach compliance

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
against certain standards and laws that

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
you have to be compliance with

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,160
sure you have to be compliance and sure

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,240
if you can protect your perimeter

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
nothing bad in that but that is not the

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
the real goal the real goal is to reduce

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,880
the risk

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,479
of any incident or breach or disruption

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
happening anywhere in your digital asset

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,000
so in the old world it was only

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
certified experts who were

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,479
allowed and invited to do security today

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
it's everybody

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
it's those who design software those who

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
develop software those who test software

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,759
those who use software

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,759
it's everybody it's the leadership of a

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
group it's it's the ones

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
who are individual contributors may not

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
even work with software but they're all

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
using it

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
and we're all adding to the risk because

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,520
we have something

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,199
that can cause a breach to happen we

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
have credentials we have access to

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
things so we have to build this security

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,479
thinking into

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
the practice of everybody and that's a

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
change from the la

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
from previous times when we didn't have

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
to worry about security it wasn't an

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
issue

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
but it is an issue now and when we do it

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,160
we will switch

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,360
security from being a cynical guard of

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
rules and and and sort of a

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,840
team that says no to a business enabler

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,600
that allows you to build better software

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
that consumers will trust that they are

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
more eager to use

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
so instead of saying danger stay away

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,440
from this thing

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
we say tell us what you see let's learn

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,400
together

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
and instead of looking for blame when

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
things go wrong you do a retro and you

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,680
learn from it and you're not blaming

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,360
individual people for what went wrong

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
this is a practice we've learned from

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,440
airline safety

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
where they will do retros and even tiny

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
tiny deviations

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
in how an airplane is operating or

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,479
landing anything

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
all the details and they never look do

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,199
it in order to blame people they do it

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,880
in order to learn

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
and they share the information between

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,280
all airlines even though they're

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
competitors

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,599
we have to learn to do the same with

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
software and when we do that the cost

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,360
won't be unchecked and go through the

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
roof it will be correlated with the

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,599
results

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
that we are achieving so we must

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
democratize security make it an issue

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
for everybody

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
in essence we need to learn from open

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
source we need to do

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,039
to security what open source did to

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
software 20 years ago 15 years ago and

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
still is doing

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
we need to legislate cyber hygiene and

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
make sure that it's a requirement on

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,639
companies that are serving our citizens

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,680
we need to fix our software or throw it

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,440
away

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,960
we can't keep going with software that

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,720
isn't secure

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,639
and finally in education we shouldn't

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
call it computer science or software

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
engineering if there is no cyber

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
security

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
courses involved in it and imagine today

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
you can take a cs degree without

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
learning anything about security

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,440
that's so wrong it's so stupid it's so

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
bad and this is why most of the security

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
experts we have in the world today

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
ethical hackers security researchers all

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
these they are self-taught because

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,800
schools don't really teach

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,360
security today so in the future

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
when we do achieve digital trust it will

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,839
be because we are

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,919
we are not ignoring hackers anymore we

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,320
realize that hackers are good people

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
are trying to help us and if their bad

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,720
people are trying to break in

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,320
they're not hackers they're criminals so

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
ignoring hackers will be viewed as

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,240
negligence in the future

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,279
security will be collaborative we'll

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
work together

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
share our learnings pool our defenses

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
because that's the only way to work

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,640
against an asymmetric threat

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
and we have to be transparent and open

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,120
because it's the only way

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,160
to build trust in any group it is the

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
only way to reach

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
a level of trust is to be open about

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
your shortcomings your long comings

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
whatever strengths weaknesses you have

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,959
openness leads the way just as open

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,240
source has been doing

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,200
so in summary there's just one way

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
to do security and it is together by

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
sharing what we are learning by

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,519
reviewing each other's code before it is

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,519
in deployment after it is deployment by

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,480
doing retros of everything that goes on

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
so we can learn

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
and go back earlier in the software

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,959
development life cycle

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,399
to fix the problems we had there and try

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,040
to eradicate

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,839
the vulnerabilities and the bugs that we

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,640
are creating

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
we will still have weaknesses in our

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
systems

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
it is not possible for human beings to

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,440
build something that's completely

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
safe and secure for for cyber risk it's

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
completely impossible

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,680
if something has no weaknesses and no

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,320
vulnerabilities

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,399
then it wasn't created by human beings

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
so when it's human created it will have

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
weaknesses

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,680
the good news is other human beings will

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,000
see it they can come in and help

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,839
and there are today around a million

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
ethical hackers in the world have signed

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,079
up at hacca1

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
will come in and review attack services

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,560
try to break into websites mobile

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
applications apis whatever the

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,079
blockchain infrastructure whatever it is

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
to test it

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,079
and be the immune system of the internet

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
where they

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,079
try to break in and in that way allow

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
you to fix it

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,160
because the best way to avoid getting

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,200
hacked

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,040
is to try to get hacked because once

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
somebody tries to hack into you

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,600
they tell you what they find you can fix

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,920
it so by doing that together we can

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,560
create the same positive effect

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
within cyber security that open source

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
software created in this world of

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
software

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,880
and today you're stupid if you're not

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,040
using open source software

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,839
and soon you will be seen as negligent

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
if you're not listening to hackers

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,760
so thank you for listening today hope it

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
was informative i'll stay

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,720
around for the q a you have my contact

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,600
details on this slide

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,200
feel free to reach out tag me on twitter

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
and give me your feedback on what you

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
are learning how you are solving these

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,839
problems i would love to hear from you

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
thank you

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
