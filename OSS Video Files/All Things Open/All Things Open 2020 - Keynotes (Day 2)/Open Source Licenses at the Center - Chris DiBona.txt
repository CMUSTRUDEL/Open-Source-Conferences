Description: 
	Presented by: Chris DiBona, Google
Presented at All Things Open 2020 Keynotes (Day 2)

Abstract: Open source is now a mainstream component of software development and culture. With this growth and normalization of open source, the license is often taken for granted, and we forget its role in shaping the project and community well beyond just using the code. Chris will talk about these overlooked dynamics, and remind us why itâ€™s important to keep open source licenses at the center.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,839
okay

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,960
uh i also want to take an issue with

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,440
something todd said

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
he said that licensing isn't like the

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,360
coolest

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,520
thing i i totally disagree licensing is

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,720
is and has been a fundamental part of my

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,760
my life and career and i i love software

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
licenses i

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,240
even even commercial ones i it's it's i

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
used to give this talk about how to read

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
a software license

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
and it's a super fun talk and and maybe

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,640
i'll i'll re-give it

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
seven years from now the next time i

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
speak

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
okay uh so i also want to thank angie

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
sarah and martin i couldn't have asked

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
for a better cohort of keynote speakers

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,120
it was really great listening to y'all

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,760
um and and yeah so let's get started so

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
first of all

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
before i get into the meat of the talk i

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,280
like to actually lead my

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,719
uh speeches with uh

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
well should i be paying attention to q

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
and chat no it blinks too much

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,439
um i like to leave my speeches uh with

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,119
the most recent release of open source

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,520
software from alphabet

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
so uh just 14 hours ago our verily

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
division

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
released a clinical trial simulation

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
tool called

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,280
medici so if you're currently planning a

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,799
clinical trial for a vaccine

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,040
for a you know a pandemic or something

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,280
they put some really neat work into a

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,680
set of jupiter notebooks and tools

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
for basically simulating a clinical

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,799
trial

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
and for planning a clinical trial so

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
check it out if you're interested in

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
such things

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,439
uh i'll paste a link in the chat uh it's

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
it's on github under verily life

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,479
sciences

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
and metas so and it's under the bsd

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,520
license so

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,320
what about licenses um so

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,920
uh i'm going to talk about open source

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
licenses and why it's really important

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,479
that we keep them the focal point of

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,600
what we do in open source and i know

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
you're thinking

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
i'm at an open source conference i

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,000
already like and no open source licenses

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,719
but i like to remind people about the

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,200
power

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,759
that these licenses have to do so much

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
more

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,640
than just let us release some code or

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
put a lens of neutrality on code

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,120
they give us so so much more than that

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
and as open source has grown

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
and been normalized in companies and the

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
rest and how

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
developers work i think we've sort of

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
forgotten how deep

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
the freedoms offered by these licenses

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,200
truly

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,879
are and how far they go so

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
what makes open source really special

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
when you compare to like commercial

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
licensing or whatever

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,800
is how we get to work with each other

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
so i've been at google for about 16

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
years now and people ask me is google

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,640
still doing the open source thing and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
i'm like

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,879
well yeah absolutely open source has

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
been part of google since the very very

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,280
beginning

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
and one of the reasons i have always

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
returned to

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
uh open source is the primary part of my

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,440
job is that

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
uh you know i really like to return to

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
open source

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
people i like people who make free and

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
open source software

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,440
so much they're people who have a will

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
to make things better for everyone

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
through

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
software and and through computing and i

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,599
think that's really special and it's

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,959
something that i've

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
wanted to be around and i keep being

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,480
around and have been around for

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,800
my entire career in in in computer

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
science

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
and the thing that lets us work together

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,120
and what lets us build software

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,080
are the licenses and that's why when i

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
think of open source

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
i always like whenever i see an open

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
first news story or

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,959
or a release on you know pick your

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,959
favorite

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
reddit hacker news whatever it might be

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
uh or on twitter

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,280
i always go okay but what license right

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
uh

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
so because the license tells me what i

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
can do with this code

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
now right what i don't have to ask

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
permission to do

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
so one of the first things i was asked

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
to do at google when i got there many

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
many years ago

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
was to negotiate a license for a

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
computer vision project

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
with a large west coast uh research

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
university

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,640
whose name rhymes with mamford uh so

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
we were discussing who gets to use what

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,159
how they get to use the software

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,280
who has to give each other what kind of

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,320
resources and it took about 11 months

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,959
before

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
we could just start coding together and

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,440
i remember thinking the entire time like

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
why

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,120
why are they having the open source code

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
to this negotiation

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
this seems like a huge waste of time if

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
we just had an open source

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
project that we could just work on

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,759
together we wouldn't have to do any of

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
this stuff we wouldn't have to do any of

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
this negotiation

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
and it wasn't that the negotiation was

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,960
bad or that anyone was a bad person

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
it's just open source licenses take all

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,040
this

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
and get get gets all this trickiness out

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,199
of the way

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
uh so you know i largely concentrate on

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
doing just that

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
applying open source licenses and open

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
sourcing stuff for a living

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
and it's also why google loves open

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
source software we don't have to

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
struggle best through negotiations and

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
waste time

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
we can just get to work on the things

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,160
that matter

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
so open source is pretty popular now

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,080
right and

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
i'm really happy that it's become so

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
normalized

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
uh in the world of software development

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
one of the great things about open

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
source licenses

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,600
is they tell you exactly what they mean

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,360
so when i see an apache on a project

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
everything i need to know about that is

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
is right there in the license i know how

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
i can use it i can how i can modify it

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,720
out what i have to do to distribute it

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,639
and and everyone else has the same

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,680
understanding for for these prominent

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
licenses

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
and it's really important it's why i'm a

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
huge believer in the debian free

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
software guidelines and the open source

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
definition

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,039
and because they really mean something

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,440
to me

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,759
but more importantly it's something that

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
belongs to all of us

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,600
so there are other licenses out there

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
right and they introduce things like

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
you know reselling fees or restrictions

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
on cloud providers and all the rest and

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
they're not wrong or

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
bad or evil or anything it's not open

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,160
source so

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
when i say when we say an open source

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
project

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
i think it's important that we're

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
talking about real open source software

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,639
covered by a real open source license

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,759
that follow the guidelines from the open

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
source initiative

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
and the open source definition and these

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
are the guidelines that help us work

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
together

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
so one of the things about doing open

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
source for a really long time

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
is you kind of start noticing that open

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
source has a gatekeeping problem

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
and sometimes it's actually pretty

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
intentional someone's trying to keep

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
other people out of their project they

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
just want to do it themselves they don't

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
want to talk to anybody else or

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
they want to keep it inside their

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,080
company they want to keep control

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
over that inside their company but

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
sometimes

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
it's just we're so used to operating as

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
we do we don't realize we're not being

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
inviting or welcoming to new new

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,919
developers and new users

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,319
so i can't say a lot of good things

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,039
about

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,599
covid and the pandemic but one of the

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,919
things that's happened because of covid

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,520
is these events have all gone virtual

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
and they've started attracting people

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,280
who are

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
not necessarily uh the people who would

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
have come to this

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,639
uh you know conference last year or

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
next year so we'll get people from all

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
over the world who are able to now

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,199
attend these conferences

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,080
and and so it's kind of a really

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,199
great thing so instead of talking to the

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
same

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,680
group of people who maybe i would have

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
seen at a given conference

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,960
last year i'm able to talk to people all

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,280
over the world

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,960
and and here's the thing i

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,479
think that open source could be doing a

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,520
lot better a job of welcoming new users

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
so we can avoid the unconscious

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
discrimination now

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
and we can recognize the hostility of

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
doing things the way they've always been

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
done we can use this time

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,160
to change um things like refusing to

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
adopt a code of conduct or

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,080
making an assumption that someone has

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
time to search through and scan and

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,759
scroll up a

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
you know a like a whole raft of slack

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
channels

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
right um we're assuming that they can

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
work in the same time zone

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
as as you were within a couple hours of

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,680
your time zone

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,879
um and and none of this is how we make

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
software better together

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,199
so so my uh my friend brian fitzpatrick

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
he has this great metaphor

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,280
about uh open source projects and groups

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
being like circles

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,560
right once you stand in a big circle and

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
you focus internally on this project

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,199
it's actually really really

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
hard for anyone to break the circle and

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
join

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,279
right so you have to sort of you have to

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
go pac-man as

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,479
as brian says you have to go pac-man you

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
have to open up

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,399
uh your circle so there's an entry point

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
for others to join so we've run a couple

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
programs at google that are about

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,279
opening these circles

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,880
uh first is the summer of code and the

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,160
second of the season of docs

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,760
they both give people who don't

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
traditionally work on open source offer

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,839
an opportunity to contribute upstream

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,920
to learn and get involved in a project

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,360
in the last 15 years we've had 15 000

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
students from more than 100 countries

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,040
participate in the summer of code

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
and they've contributed more to 680

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
projects

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
and we're in our second year of the

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
season of docs and that's mentoring 80

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,279
technical writers this year and they

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
started with 44 last year

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
so we shouldn't stop there though

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,920
everyone should be thinking about how

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
their projects can bring in new users

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
and contributors

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
you know uh sarah was talking about

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,800
vue.js one of the things

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,240
so i i make kind of fun of javascript

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
for being very fashionable and having

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,040
lots of frameworks and

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
and all the rest but the thing about

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,959
javascript is they're so

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
welcoming to new developers and new

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,839
users and it's so

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,040
wonderful to see it and it's something

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
that folks like sarah should be super

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,320
proud of

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,080
right um anyways so i i just wanted to

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,279
point out we should be wary about how

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
people want to take

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,560
this amazing thing with yours open

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
source and close it up so

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,399
they'll take things not covered by the

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,560
license and use that for control

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
and add additional restrictions on their

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
open source projects

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
like uh you know for a long time patents

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
weren't even mentioned in most licenses

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
and now they are

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
but one thing that most licenses don't

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
address is trademarks

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
so let me give you some context last

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
year alone

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,040
googlers opened more than 150 000 pull

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,720
requests on more than 70 000

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
repositories on github

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
it doesn't even count the thousands of

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,720
other repositories we work in outside of

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
github

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
where we host major projects like

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
android and chromium now that's a lot of

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
open source contributions

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
and because of that sheer size we tend

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
to hit problems

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,920
in open source faster than many in our

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,680
office our open source programs office

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
we get to use these experiences to help

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,079
everyone in the open source community

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
as well as google uh and with trademarks

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,560
the problem we hit

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,480
is that people shipping the software

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
they need explicit permission to use the

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
trademarks

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
and this is an unaddressed problem in

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,920
the licenses so

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
we recently got together with some key

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,720
open source contributors and computer

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
scientists to create the open usage

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
commons

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,600
which which is working on creating uh

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
trademark guidelines that conform to the

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
open source definition

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,800
so let's ask a question how can you tell

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,760
if a project is really open source

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
so uh let's talk about forking one of

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,320
the most powerful things about open

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,279
source licenses

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
the real ones and how you can tell a

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,519
project is actually open source

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
is you are able to take that software

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,399
fork it

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,079
and go your own way i've heard people

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
threaten to fork projects

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
people threaten me like i'm gonna afford

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
this project if you don't do this thing

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
and i always respond the exact same way

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
i said that sounds fantastic you should

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,480
totally do that

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
and it sometimes catches people by

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
surprise a lot of people have this

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
notion that forks are super super

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
negative

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,760
but forks are an incredibly important

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
healthy uh part of open source software

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
think about it so the way i think about

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
this okay is every time you ship

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,519
something to a user

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,880
a customer whatever that's a fork right

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,240
because you're basically you're

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
you're you're putting a flag in the

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,480
ground saying okay we're

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
we're gonna ship this thing right it's

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
off the main trunk it's somewhere out

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
there and someone's relying on that

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
branch

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
right so you just forked software

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,839
congratulations

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,880
and that means you're probably going to

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
come up with new features and

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
tools to work with that fork and that's

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
super neat and here's the great thing

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
about open source

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
software licenses you can do that and i

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
think our products become stronger and

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
healthier for that innovation

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
and it's how we stay relevant with our

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
users

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
the other reason that forex are not a

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
negative end-all be-all is that open

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,320
source licenses allow these projects to

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
come back together

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,880
that they merge the fork back in so we

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
had this happen with one external and

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
android

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
there was a time in android's history

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,480
and i know this is gonna be super

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
shocking to everyone who's ever used a

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
cell phone

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,560
where battery life kind of stunk right

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
and

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,079
linux and and batteries were in this

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
sort of terrible relationship uh android

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,320
needed a way to tell the kernel to tell

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
the cpu to mellow out to to

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
not come out of the low power states too

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,480
aggressively

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
and to use less battery now at the time

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
this wasn't actually of much interest in

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
the upstream kernel community that was

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,000
largely concerned with server

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
workloads um but android users really

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
really needed this so we've worked the

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
kernel

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
and some people were super upset about

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
it and i i remember telling them the

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
time listen

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
we're going to come back together in a

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,279
couple years and we're going to

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
merge the best of both worlds and we're

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,480
going to move on from there

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,079
so and that's exactly what happened it

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
took about two or three years

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,600
but then wake locks got pulled into a

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
new kernel structure that allowed for

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,079
this kind of power management

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
and you know because we were able to

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,079
fork the kernel

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,720
and then bring that back into linux we

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
now have

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
some two and a half billion devices

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
running linux and android

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,839
and that's incredibly powerful and that

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
was only possible because it's

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
really an open source project that you

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,040
can fork and innovate with

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,160
so uh so it's really an honor to be

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
talking to you today it's an honor to be

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
in the open source community

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
and i'm really grateful to be talking to

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,279
you today so if you remember nothing

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
else from the stock remember this

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,399
uh the open source license is all the

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
permission you need uh with an open

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,959
source license

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,160
you can build the project you want the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,279
community you want to be a part of and

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
work together with others

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
so keep that at the center fork stuff

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,839
