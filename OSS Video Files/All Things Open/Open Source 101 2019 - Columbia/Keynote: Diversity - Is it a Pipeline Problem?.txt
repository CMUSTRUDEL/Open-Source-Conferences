Abstract: Everyone is talking about diversity and inclusion these days. But why does it really matter? And if you’ve had a hard time finding women to hire, how do you solve that problem? What are some ways companies have done D&I right, and how can you learn from them?

We’ll explore some practical reasons why you should be aware of how D&I impacts your business and easy tips to begin changing how you and your team think today. We’ll also cover do’s and don’ts of how to build an inclusive team culture and creating a sustainable environment that includes everyone.

so with key notes key notes are always a

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,880
centerpiece of any event that you put on

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,880
right so you want your key notes to

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,670
capture ideas and topics that are widely

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,230
applicable and ones that are reflective

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,880
of the fact that you feel that as an

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,740
organizer that they're really important

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
because your keynote topics and your

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,210
keynote speakers are reflection of you

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,550
as an organizing group putting something

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,140
on so you as an attendee can tell a lot

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,450
about an event mother's keynote topics

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,920
and keynote speakers Tracy come on up

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,149
Tracy is I could give you her bio and it

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,690
would take me about all day she's a

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,340
Microsoft MVP I think I recently saw on

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,559
that she's a Google developer expert

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,129
she's a co-founder of this dot labs

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,780
she runs modern web and pretty much

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,489
anything else you can think of Tracy

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,559
does but the topic is diversity and

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,269
inclusion and I know you have been

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,530
talking about this for a long time so we

00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:10,650
definitely wanted to have you here today

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,790
thank you so hi everybody so excited to

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,700
be here today

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,670
life Todd said my name is Tracy

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm the lead at a JavaScript consultancy

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,180
called this not last we do a lot for the

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,810
JavaScript community so we have a lot of

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,090
free events and information out there

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,070
and basically all things JavaScript I'm

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,990
also a Google developer expert Microsoft

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,119
MVP I do community relations for the

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,920
node foundation and in my free time I do

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,710
things like sit on the rxjs core team

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,860
and who knows what else so I'm doing a

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,990
lot as Todd said but I'm very excited

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,640
today specifically to talk about

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,229
diversity inclusion because this is

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,869
something that I don't get to talk about

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,479
very often and there are words that we

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,189
hear very often right but the question

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,039
is why does it really matter why are

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,210
people actually talking about it so in

00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,590
this talk we're going to be defining a

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,840
few different things we'll talk about

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,030
hey what is what are these two words um

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,799
why does it matter in products and

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,350
application development how does it

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,600
affect the bottom line or does it hiring

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,039
retention team culture different case

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,260
studies on people doing it right

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,730
building culture and actually solving

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,190
one of the biggest problems which is the

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,330
pipeline problem so let's go ahead and

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,720
define diversity first I'm Gallus Gallus

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,640
definition of

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,010
versity is that it represents a full

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,410
spectrum of human demographic

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,680
differences so it's race religion gender

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,710
sexual orientation age socioeconomic

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,690
status or physical disability I really

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,510
like this definition because it shows us

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,150
that diversity isn't just about gender

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,500
or skin color and that's really into

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,320
portent to note because that's a very

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,990
common misconception in fact a lot of

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,720
companies also consider lifestyles

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,420
personality characteristics perspectives

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,360
opinions family composition education

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,650
level all elements of diversity so that

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,240
means that if you're not respecting the

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,370
idea of diversity you're probably not

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,600
respecting your current team now let's

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,630
talk about inclusion

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,350
so inclusion refers to a sense of

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:16,110
cultural belonging where employees feel

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,220
valued respected accepted and encouraged

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,050
to fully participate

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm sure this resonates with everybody

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,310
because if you're on a team or you don't

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,830
feel respected accepted or encouraged

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,570
you're probably not a happy person it's

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,150
not an inclusive environment for you

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,850
employees in inclusive rment

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,610
environments feel appreciate it for

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,930
their unique characteristics right they

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,940
feel more comfortable sharing their

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,890
ideas and this is the sort of

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,050
synergistic idea of if you have a good

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,670
team that people feel welcomed and

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,390
included then you're gonna perform

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,209
better so let's talk about and take a

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,760
deeper look into why it's also just very

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,620
practical to have a diverse team when it

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,100
comes to designing a product or an

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,890
application this is a funnier example so

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,680
in 2012 be Creole East a pen called beak

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,260
for her and you have to sort of think

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,299
like was there not a diverse enough team

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,370
of thinking about how this would come

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,650
across in the market right the pens were

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,750
purple and pink and they were advertised

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,510
as the perfect accessory that would add

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,180
a touch of personality and the internet

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,430
really took to this and you can see here

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,220
Hulk gave a review that he hates puny

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,260
pens and he demanded a beak for him and

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,910
there's also really funny pictures where

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,890
you know men are trying to use speak for

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,250
her but they can't seem to write because

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,700
it's not designed for them so pretty

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,410
hilarious a little more serious is the

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,600
Apple watch that so this is a great

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,580
example as well of a product failed due

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,320
to diversity I'm after its release

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,110
customers started posting on social

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,690
media that the Smart Watch if you had

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,670
darker skin you couldn't detect it

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,890
couldn't detect contact on the skin and

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,660
it couldn't detect her pulse so that

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,430
kind of sucked and you know we're just

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,920
speculating here we could call this a

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,630
technology problem right but as a lot of

00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,090
companies have early testers for new

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,550
products and if you look at Apple's team

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,710
right here the executive team you have

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,900
to wonder hey was the lack of diversity

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,790
at the top the reason why this problem

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,140
wasn't caught early on in some instances

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,610
diversity and designing for diversity

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,560
it's actually a matter of life and death

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,290
so this is an artificial heart example

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:31,450
and this is the sign kardia artificial

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,880
heart and it was used for patients with

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,060
a body surface area of 1.7 square meters

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,430
or greater so unfortunately for anybody

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,080
but the average man this life-saving

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,880
heart is not designed for them and

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,340
that's pretty depressing right to say

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,290
hey if I'm not an average man my life

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,510
does not matter or did not matter as

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,640
much when designing this product and why

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,760
would a company value one person's life

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,250
over another maybe again just

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,040
speculating was the team a majority male

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,630
we don't know to their defense ten years

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,930
later they did design a smaller heart

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,630
but it took them ten years to get there

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,430
another example and not to pick on uber

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,640
but when we look at newer tech companies

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,650
like uber there was a lot of controversy

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,960
around a driver sexually attacking woman

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,610
and some larger publications like ink

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,100
magazine for example asked the question

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,440
would an uber with more woman in

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,380
technical roles has built better tools

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,690
for protecting female users from sexual

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,160
attacks by their drivers and I can't

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,780
tell you how many times I've sort of

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,780
considered not getting into an uber

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,360
because of my safety so yeah if I were

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,300
there

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,379
I probably would have done that though

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,639
if those don't convince you why

00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:45,979
diversity matters for teams money always

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,719
talks right so the next question is does

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,759
diversity really affect the bottom wine

00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,379
and I have questions about this too does

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,900
that actually affect the bottom line

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,270
according to CompTIA a CEO Todd

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,009
Thibodeau he recently spoke about this

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,490
and said that diversity efforts could

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:04,129
actually net the IT industry over 400

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,469
billion dollars extra in revenue each

00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,060
year so yeah I think that number

00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,240
definitely affects the bottom line and

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,870
to back this up Mackenzie did a study

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,449
with 356 public companies and it showed

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,180
that this is in fact true companies in

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:23,479
the top quartile for racial and ethnic

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,280
diversity are 35 percent more likely to

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,279
have financial returns above their

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,069
respective national industry medians to

00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,080
be 30 percent more likely to do so it's

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:35,169
kind of Awesome gender diversity is the

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,580
same thing 15 percent were more likely

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:40,669
who were in the top quartile for gender

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,050
diversity so it sorry to pick on uber

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,370
again but this is kind of amazing

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,680
because you can talk about you know

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,710
extra four hundred billion dollars

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,539
top quartile but if you look at uber

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,419
this is actually a very direct example

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,360
of how diversity or the lack thereof and

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,889
the bad press generated from it affected

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,339
rubriz numbers so when Susan power

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:04,370
released her post in favor of 2017 that

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:06,080
year from then to June lubbers market

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,909
sure actually decreased by three and a

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,199
half percent and list market share

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,680
increased by three and a half percent

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,870
that was insane to me and if anything

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,909
that really convinced me that Wow having

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,150
an inclusive work environment is really

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,819
really important so employees are also

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,800
the biggest cost to any organization

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,750
really and let's talk about tips on how

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,960
to make sure hiring retention and team

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,539
culture can be improved so I went to

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Twitter and to ask why diverse teams

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,680
matter and Becca said that until a

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
company has a more diverse team they're

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,130
gonna keep missing out on great job

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,729
candidates because they checked out your

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,649
team page and saw a bunch of white dudes

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,060
so in order to make a more diverse team

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,060
especially during the hiring

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,279
process here's a few tips so making sure

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,020
that you're recruiting properly making

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,820
sure that candidates are sourced through

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,230
a variety of different methods not just

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,480
the traditional recruiting pipelines

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,029
making sure that your job descriptions

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,950
are gender-neutral making sure that

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,589
diversity is actually listed on your

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,480
career website and all candidates not

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,130
just diverse candidates should have the

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,380
opportunity to meet with a diverse group

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,120
of employees right if a woman is

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,920
interviewing for a tech job and she only

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,089
is interviewed by men she's probably

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,830
going to think okay well this

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:23,300
organization is just male one of the

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,640
reasons why it's so important to create

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,440
an inclusive work culture so that all

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,440
team members feel like they're treated

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,120
well in fact unfair treatment in the

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,300
workplace is literally the single

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,640
largest driver of turnover every single

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,220
year and it costs people over us

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,290
actually over 16 billion dollars per

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,279
year in employer replacement cost that

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:48,230
is insane so we can talk about diversity

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,390
inclusion and why it's important all we

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,430
want but it's really about the execution

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,780
of diversity and inclusion that's really

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,430
important so let's go ahead and look at

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,720
a few case studies that of people that

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,150
have done it right

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,339
Salesforce is really committed to fixing

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,950
the gender wage gap and has spent over

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:07,280
six million dollars since 2015 doing

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,860
this in fact in 2017 alone over eleven

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,990
percent of Salesforce employees required

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,520
a pay adjustment which totaled three

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,790
million dollars just that year alone

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,190
that is really cool

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,930
intentional hiring is another really

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,900
great way we can look at Atlassian for

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,400
example so they started in 2015 to say

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,080
hey we're gonna start changing the ratio

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,530
when it comes to people coming into our

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,589
company and first it was 15% 2016 was

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:37,070
17% and then finally in 2017 it jumped

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,900
to 57% and now over 60% of the incoming

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,959
graduates are actually women and that is

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,610
really really really cool to see si P is

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,279
another great example so they offer

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,620
virtual training programs called focus

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,880
on insight which helps educate employees

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,400
about diversity and inclusion next up

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,170
let's talk about different ways and

00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,140
reasons why diversity inclusion is

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,579
important and how to actually build in

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,769
of work culture so I'm gonna give you

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,540
guys a few tips here so I went to

00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,640
Twitter again and asked and Kari says

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,279
that you should be using your platform

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,200
to make certain topics safe to talk

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,670
about and start that conversation if

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,140
it's not already happening because

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,880
chances are the conversation isn't

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,680
happening not because it's not wanted

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,589
but the pickup's because people don't

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,380
know if it's a safe environment to do so

00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:27,680
Cindy of Microsoft also shares a really

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,170
good example she says that in her

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,170
organization in Microsoft one thing that

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,690
they did was aim for a power of three so

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,740
three others have true decision-making

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,200
voices in big team decisions Judith

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,089
she says that hey it's really simple

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,470
just remember to stand up and speak when

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,600
you see a woman or person of color

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,610
singled out to take notes or make coffee

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,990
if anybody asked me to make coffee

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,470
because I was a woman I would literally

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,290
die but allies who are supportive in

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,850
this it's really easier you know for the

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,519
person who's not singled out to actually

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,040
say something so helping helping out in

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,560
that sense is really good I really love

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,810
these five tips because they were kind

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,380
of you know interesting for me to think

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,449
about as well ways to improve inclusion

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,029
in your workplace bounce ideas off of

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,320
someone unexpected change up your

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,430
environment right if you change the

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,890
prayer environment you're gonna change

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,570
up your way of thinking rotate who runs

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,430
your meetings leave your assumptions at

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,620
the door that's assumed and talked about

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,990
something other than work um

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,839
externally as well here are some great

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,850
ways you can actually be a better Ally

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,190
so speak their name when they aren't

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,470
around share their career goals with

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,269
influencers recommend them for stretch

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,190
assignments and invite them to high

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,060
profile meetings and also just endorse

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:49,190
them publicly so Carol Adams who's a

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,709
professor at Durham University Business

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,899
School in England she says that with

00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:55,490
diversity reporting so this is another

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,500
great way to build an inclusive culture

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,029
within your organization it actually

00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,660
affects people's perception of the

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,910
workplace

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,130
and job satisfaction so when you do

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,750
diversity reporting as a company you

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,880
start seeing more woman and ethnic

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,380
minorities applying for promotions

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,730
whereas before they might not have

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,209
because they thought hey maybe there's

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,209
no point

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,330
additionally whenever you're doing

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,940
things like this you want to make sure

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,380
that you have metrics around it so if

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,730
you're going to start any diversity

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,440
initiatives you really want to make sure

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,290
to benchmark your company by serving

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,660
them make sure to identify ways of

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,760
improvement and think about hey are

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,130
there going are there any demographics

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,230
that have maybe suboptimal experiences

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,310
and also who needs more support who

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,280
needs more support within your

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,050
organization now the hardest part about

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,790
building a diverse team is of course

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,860
finding diverse hires so there is a new

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,780
pipeline and this guy Ryan Craig who's

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,150
an author and investor he said that

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,040
faster and cheaper education models like

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,810
coding boot camps have tremendous

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,560
potential for that to diversify

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,120
competitive workforces so when you look

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,950
at that and you look at the metrics

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,350
course report came out with a

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,690
demographic study and in coding boot

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,870
camps there's forty three percent women

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,820
in coding boot camps versus University

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,130
CS majors same thing for black and

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,960
Latinos 25 percent versus ten percent so

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,910
these numbers should really encourage

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,920
your team and recruiters to sort of look

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,130
beyond the fresh college grads for

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,290
entry-level development positions so

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,030
what is still stopping the ratio from

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,820
changing then if you have an influx of

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,100
women and underrepresented minorities

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,390
coming in what is the actual problem

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,250
still well

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,530
hiring bias right so that's very

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,480
important I'm we tend to recruit those

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,540
who are some culturally similar to

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,820
ourselves right so during the interview

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,800
process the actual hiring of getting

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,810
these folks into tech becomes the actual

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,850
bottleneck and because we all have

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,030
implicit bias right and because there's

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,310
a lot of white males in in tech then you

00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:01,030
know we tend to recruit they tend to

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,100
recruit people like themselves and the

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,220
problem again is because we don't have

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,080
enough diverse leaders right there's not

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,560
enough a large percentage of diverse

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,050
leaders to help change this ratio in

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,090
fact 70% of tech companies have no

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,450
female board members and 54 percent have

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,690
actually no female executives so there's

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,570
also a huge retention problem in tech

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,110
women are leaving why are they leaving

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,390
in the first year women are for

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,579
five percent more likely to leave than

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,500
men and you might think okay well

00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,490
they're all having babies who want who

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,420
doesn't want I want to be a stay-at-home

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:40,339
wife or mom whatever um but that's not

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,529
the actual reason the reason why they're

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:45,589
leaving is because of isolation at the

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,300
macho culture or lack of sponsors so

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,730
this goes back again to the problem that

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,440
inclusive inclusivity that we've been

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,899
talking about so we can kind of

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,209
summarize the issues that we've been

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,950
seeing and about finding and keeping

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,529
diverse hires into sort of four key

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,630
areas you need to fix your pipeline you

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,790
need to get diverse pipelines hiring

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,560
bias needs to be addressed teams need to

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,540
start growing their next diverse leaders

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,180
and inclusive cultures need to be

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,220
created so people don't keep leaving so

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,160
then I thought to myself can I solve

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,600
this problem and I decided to create

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,910
this thing called a higher the femme

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,800
power program at this dot to help

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,260
companies succeed at changing the ratio

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,000
so what I wanted to share was some ways

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,579
that we solve this problem to give you

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,350
guys some ideas on how you can or you

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,449
know of course we'd love to help you so

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,130
one thing that we do is we actually work

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,500
with a lot of boot camps and diverse

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,120
organizations to build a pipeline and we

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,980
have the steady pipeline of diverse

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,589
candidates coming in the next thing we

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,339
do is addressing the hiring bias problem

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,810
so the way we do that is we actually

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,839
interview these diverse candidates

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,940
through unbiased interview processes and

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,230
was a diverse hiring committee so that

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,209
your team doesn't have to do it

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,670
themselves

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:01,550
teams needing to grow their next diverse

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,290
leaders so one thing that happens when

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,299
you hire people through our program is

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,309
we actually pair them with a senior

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,819
architect mentor as well so they work

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,829
side by side on client projects and this

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,809
helps provide them support and teaches

00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,850
them how to be the next leaders so that

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,790
you can hire them after the contract

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,410
engagement inclusive cultures as well so

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,959
this is really important

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,970
learn by watching so with these amazing

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,339
architects senior developers that we

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,020
have on our team since they're paired

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,990
with the people the underrepresented

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,690
minorities we teach your team and lead

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,520
by example and we try to facilitate more

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,160
inclusive cultures within your

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,970
organization so you know if you can

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,740
