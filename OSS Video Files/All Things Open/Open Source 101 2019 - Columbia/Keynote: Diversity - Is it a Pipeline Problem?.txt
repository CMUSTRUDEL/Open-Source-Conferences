Abstract: Everyone is talking about diversity and inclusion these days. But why does it really matter? And if you’ve had a hard time finding women to hire, how do you solve that problem? What are some ways companies have done D&I right, and how can you learn from them?

We’ll explore some practical reasons why you should be aware of how D&I impacts your business and easy tips to begin changing how you and your team think today. We’ll also cover do’s and don’ts of how to build an inclusive team culture and creating a sustainable environment that includes everyone.
