Abstract: DevOps made its debut ten years ago, and there has been confusion over exactly what it is ever since.  From a cultural movement, to a set of tools, to job and team descriptions, there have been many conflicting viewpoints. When Site Reliability Engineering emerged as a discipline in 2016, it only added to the confusion among Engineering and Engineering Leadership.  Unfortunately confusion still remains, and many wonder how to incorporate these ideas and roles into their organizations.

By the end of this session, you will have a firm grasp of what SRE and DevOps are and how they relate to one another.  I will describe the advantages and pitfalls of common industry practices, describe tools for sharing information, and discuss balancing innovation with availability. Finally, you will have suggestions and ideas for incorporating SRE into your organization, with the goal of iterating more rapidly and safely.
