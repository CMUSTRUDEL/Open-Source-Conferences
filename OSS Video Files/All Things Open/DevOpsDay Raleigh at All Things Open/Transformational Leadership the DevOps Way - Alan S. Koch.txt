Abstract: The 2017 State of DevOps Report listed as a Key Finding, “The characteristics of transformational leadership — vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, and personal recognition — are highly correlated with IT performance.”  We will explore these five characteristics as they apply not just to DevOps, but to anything we undertake.

Leadership is not limited to “senior leadership”.  The characteristics of Transformational Leadership are necessary for leaders of any type and at every level of the organization, not the least of which are Project Managers and the Subject Matter Experts and other technical leaders with whom they collaborate to achieve project success.

We will begin with the focused definition of leadership (in the paragraph above) to inspire all audience members to see the content as being relevant to their own work.  Then we will walk through the five characteristics of Transformational Leadership (as identified by the 2017 State of DevOps Report) and explore what each looks like, and how we as leaders make each a part of our leadership style:

- Vision
- Inspirational Communication
- Intellectual Stimulation
- Supportive Leadership
- Personal Recognition

We will wrap up with an inspirational look at the expected net effects of this leadership style:

- Generative and high-trust cultural norms
- Better project outcomes
- Team experimentation & innovation, to achieve outcomes faster
- Working across organizational silos for strategic alignment

well welcome everybody

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,160
to uh our look at transformational

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
leadership

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,720
the idea of transformational leadership

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
is really important to us

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
devops started off as a grassroots

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
movement

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,400
and really was very much just a matter

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
of

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
engineers figuring out what are some

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
great ways to work and

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,519
coming up with the tools and all the

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,040
different things that needed to happen

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,960
but it became pretty clear that it was

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
more than just a grassroots thing if you

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
want to make any kind of a significant

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,079
impact on an organization it does

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
require leadership uh

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,200
and so that's really what we're talking

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
about here uh

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,840
and actually this topic was highlighted

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,079
in the state of devops report

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
a few years back a couple of years back

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,680
actually two years back

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,800
they called out as one of their key uh

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
messages in the 2017 state of devops

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,119
report the need

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,960
for transformational leadership and in

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,080
fact i have the quote down here

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
uh in the bottom part of this slide here

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,720
the characteristics of transformation

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,720
transformational leadership

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,080
um are highly correlated

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,560
with it performance and

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
that actually was really an important

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,280
message here you know the idea that

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
leadership

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
is it's not just the technology it's not

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
just a matter of working

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
in uh in technical ways it's not a

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
matter of the tools

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,880
but indeed it really is a matter of

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
leadership

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
as well this is the directed graph that

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
they had

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
in the state of devops report over here

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,159
on the left hand side is

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
transformational leadership and these

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
five attributes which of course is what

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,799
we're going to be looking at here but

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,159
essentially showing how they enable all

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
these things that lead

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,399
over here on the right hand side to i.t

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
performance and organizational

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,759
performance

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,399
so that's really what this is about now

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,800
it's important for us to recognize that

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,840
when

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,280
they use the term leadership they

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,560
did not just have in mind the idea of

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
senior leadership

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,160
of course senior leadership is

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
critically important

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
it's kind of hard to get any of the

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,720
ducks in a row if you don't have

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,319
senior leadership on board with you but

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,000
what they had in mind here

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,440
was anyone who has a leader

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,120
role anywhere in the organization

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,519
so this talk is actually for any of us

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
who have a leader role in our

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
organizations here

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,560
yes if you are in the senior ranks of

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
the organization

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
absolutely i want to talk to you but

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,480
also anyone who

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,840
is a manager or a technical lead or a

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,560
team lead or lead in any

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
uh form even if it's just an opinion

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
leader

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,400
in your organization these are key

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
characteristics that are going to be

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
necessary to

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
help your organization then to be

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
successful

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
in implementing devops and ultimately

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,480
achieve

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,800
really high i.t performance which leads

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
to high organizational performance

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,319
so that's really what we're talking

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,319
about here

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,599
the other half of this quote i have down

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,120
here teams with the

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,959
least transformative leaders and they

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
they specifically said the bottom

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
third of of the uh the survey results

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
that they had

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,480
were half as likely to exhibit high i.t

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
performance so not only do these

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
attributes

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,040
lead to high performance but if they're

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,080
lacking they tend to

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,959
impede the ability of the organization

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
to achieve high performance so that's

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
really what we're going to be talking

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,799
about here

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,560
now these five attributes

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
i mean they all kind of sound

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
like what you would expect to see but

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
what i want to really look at

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,799
is is what do they look like on the

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
ground for the especially for those of

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
us who have leadership roles in the

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,040
organization

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,919
what does it look like for these things

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
to be part of what we're doing

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,440
so the first one i want to touch on here

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
is vision

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,720
so this is actually just the single word

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
vision

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
and in the report they explain it this

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
way over here having a clear concept

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,759
of where the organization is going and

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
where it should be

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
so that's really what they meant when

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,720
they talked about vision here

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,960
it is clearly an important role

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
of anyone in a leadership kind of a

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,240
position

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,320
to help the folks that they are leading

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,680
to have a vision of where we are going

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,360
where are we trying to

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,520
get to where do we expect to go to

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
or where do we expect to be and in fact

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,080
they specifically talk about this idea

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
of a five-year horizon

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,080
right where do we expect to be a few

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
years from now

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
and indeed what do we want to be pushing

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
towards

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,080
the reason why this is so important for

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,639
a high performance organization

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,320
is because it's about the only way that

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
everyone in the organization is going to

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
be able to be

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,120
pulling in the same direction

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,759
now clearly senior leadership is going

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
to be

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,560
providing that big picture that the

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
whole organization is going to be able

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
to follow

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
but it really does fall to the leaders

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
further

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
down the food chain to operationalize

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,560
that

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,039
essentially to take that that vision of

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,520
where the organization is going

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,479
and then translate that into well what

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
does that mean for

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,600
us as a department what does that mean

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,639
for

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
us as a team what does it mean for us as

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
a group of people who are just

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
part of this bigger organization so

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
essentially translating that big picture

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
vision

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,240
into what does that mean for us and what

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
vision should we have

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
for our particular work that we are

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
engaged in

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
in support of course of the larger

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
organization

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
so that's really what it translates into

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
not only is the leader need to

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,759
understand

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,720
that big picture but also need to be

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,240
able to translate it into the local

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,919
needs to be able to really communicate

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,400
that vision uh at a nuts and bolts level

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
to the folks who are working you know in

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,039
in a particular team

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
whatever uh sphere of control that

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
particular leader happens to have

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
so that's the starting point here and

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
and i i love the fact that this is

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,319
actually the first one that they talked

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
about because

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,720
indeed without division all the rest of

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
them aren't really going to make a lot

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
of sense because people are going to be

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
pulling in all different directions

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,599
the vision is actually what helps us all

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,800
to pull in the same direction

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,639
all right um and i by the way i welcome

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
please do put stuff into the chat

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,120
especially since we have a few extra

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
minutes here

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,280
uh any insights or examples that any of

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,039
you have

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
definitely do that and of course as

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
chris said throwing questions in the

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,360
chat or the q

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,280
a is definitely welcome so vision is the

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
first of the five

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,280
uh five attributes that they talked

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,280
about

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,000
the second i kind of feel like it comes

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,800
directly from the first one

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
because having a vision is only the

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,199
beginning of it you need to be able to

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,199
communicate right and that is actually

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,039
the second of the attributes that they

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
called out here is inspirational

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,919
communication

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,680
and i love the fact that they use the

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,120
word inspirational

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,639
because it's not just about

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
communicating but it's about

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,440
communicating in a way that

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,000
will indeed inspire and motivate in fact

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,039
that's the

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,639
the actual term that they used right a

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,840
way that inspires and

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,319
motivates um so providing uh

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,319
you know the the guidance of oh this is

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,440
our vision this is what we're doing

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,160
but this uh this is why

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,479
essentially is what it comes down to to

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,080
get

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,319
the troops all fired up wanting to

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,599
uh to move in the direction that we need

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
to move

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,639
um so now they highlighted a couple of

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,599
very interesting points here

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
so the first one is inspiring pride in

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,599
just

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
being a member of the team right so

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
it's one thing to say this is the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
direction that we're going but it's

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
another way to be communicating that in

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
a way where it's like

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
yes yes that's where we're going i

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
really really want to be part of this

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,920
thing that's moving this direction

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,680
so communicating what that vision is and

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,399
where we are going and what we're doing

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
in a way that really helps the team

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,880
members

00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,480
to latch on to that and to want to be

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
on that train another part of it though

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
they kind of

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
and this almost turns around saying

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
positive things about the team

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,399
so you know being you know having pride

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,920
that you are a part of the team

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,160
uh you know it's like i want to be on

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
this train but the leader also needs to

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
essentially

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,000
help the team members to really be

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,560
um connected with uh how they feel

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
about the team you know to say look

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
there are some positive things here

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
especially

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,959
every team you know has challenges

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,920
they things go wrong you know whatever

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,200
even in those kind of situations here

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
you want to also

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,399
say and but there are positive things

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,120
and keep

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
those positive messages coming for the

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,880
team here

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,680
um it is a matter of the passion

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
the motivation you know and having it

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
first

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,120
but then being able to communicate that

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
these things are really really important

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
not just to the organization at large

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
but important to us

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
as members of the team right so that's

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
really what

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
inspirational communication comes down

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,720
to is how

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,360
we actually bring this information to

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
the team

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
a way that inspires in a way that

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,440
actually motivates the team

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
to move in the directions that we want

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
to be able to move

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,279
so those first two really do go together

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
the vision and the inspirational

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,760
communication

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,800
now the next one takes us in a different

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,120
direction

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,320
intellectual stimulation when i read

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
this one

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,920
i kind of went yes this is the kind of

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
an environment that i would want to work

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,600
in uh

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
you know you really want to say i i

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
don't want to just be

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
wrote following the rules i don't want

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
to just be

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,120
doing the same thing day in and day out

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
i actually want to start challenging

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,079
things and notice that in the three

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
bullets

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,000
first off the summary is challenging

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,560
followers but then each of the three

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,360
bullets is about challenging

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
right so challenging the status quo

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,480
right

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,560
the way we do things okay cool we got to

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
the way we do things because we said hey

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,760
this is probably a good way for

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,640
us to do things but keeping up

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,959
with just the way things are is not how

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
a team becomes a truly high performance

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
team

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,560
it's always you know looking for and how

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,399
can we get better

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,320
regardless of how good things are now

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,079
obviously if there's challenges

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
of course you'd want to be saying and

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
what can we do about it

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
but even when there aren't challenges

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,640
even when

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,640
it's not obvious that there are ways

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,600
that we can be improving

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
we still want to be challenging that is

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
this

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,240
really the best that we can do is this

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,639
really uh something the standard we want

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
to

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,480
settle for and i do like to think of it

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
in terms of settling

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,000
for those challenges and that then leads

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
to this next one here the idea of

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
challenging the team to ask new

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,240
questions

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
right we got to where we are we got to

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
our status quo

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
by asking and answering certain

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
questions well the way we're going to

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,680
move beyond

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,240
the status quo is to ask new questions

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
um what questions should those be i

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,959
don't know

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
and that's the cool part about it here

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,839
is challenging the team

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
to be asking new questions of course as

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,800
a leader

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
i would want to be asking new questions

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
as well but don't

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,639
restrict it to just yourself asking

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,839
those questions

00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,079
encouraging team members to be

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,399
constantly posing new questions

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,720
encouraging the team members to be

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,440
thinking in very very different ways

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
about things and to be raising questions

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
and some of the questions you know it's

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
like

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,639
oh yeah that was a dumb question that's

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,800
okay

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,760
i love dumb questions because sometimes

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
the dumb questions

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
the ones that come up with some of the

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,480
greatest ideas

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,160
stimulating intellectual approaches to

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,519
things that's really what we're talking

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,440
about here

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,720
and then the third challenge is

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,200
challenging basic assumptions

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
and this is a really hard one because we

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,519
all have a history

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,120
we all you know have things that we have

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,560
learned through experience

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,079
over time and that really builds our

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,720
model our mental model

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,399
of how things work and how we should be

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,120
operating and all of that

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
it's really really hard to challenge

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
those basic assumptions it's really

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,720
really hard to challenge those

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,320
ideas that may have served us well up to

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,079
this point

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,880
but are they going to continue to serve

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,079
us well as we move forward

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,720
so essentially notice the common

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,600
theme here the common theme is the word

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
challenge

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
because you know the best way to move

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
forward

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
is indeed if people are thinking i hate

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
to use a

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
a well-worn phrase outside the box

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,440
but that's really what we're talking

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,959
about here get out of the dang box

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,880
right challenging your team to uh to

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
step outside of the box and see what

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,959
else

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,959
there could possibly be here

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
so definitely the challenge

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,480
now the next direction they go is

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,600
supportive

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,920
leadership so the idea here is

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
kind of a human angle on this whole

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,040
thing

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
for many of us this is a challenge

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
because

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
many of us in the tech field are all

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
about the technology

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
we we aren't such touchy-feely kind of

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,519
people

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
and yet that actually makes for the best

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,440
leadership

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,720
is when we actually pay attention

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,760
to the members of our teams

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,240
from a personal perspective here

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,320
so notice the words that are used here

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,000
care and consideration

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,120
of people's personal needs and feelings

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,199
um for some of us and i

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
and i definitely would include myself in

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
this particular area here

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
this doesn't come naturally this is

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,360
something

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,120
that um that i would need to think about

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,920
and i would need to

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
to actively work on is really what it

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,639
comes down to

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,399
it's one of the cool things that i have

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,079
found over the years

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,560
is that the things that don't come

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,240
natural to naturally to me

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,000
i can still do because if i pay

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
attention to these things i recognize

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
oh yeah that's right that wouldn't be my

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,959
natural reaction and yet if i do it it

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,759
is going to

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
be the best thing for the situation for

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,120
my team

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,639
for the folks i'm working with so

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,800
stepping outside of our comfort zone of

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,600
course if your comfort zone is there

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
you definitely want to capitalize on it

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
so

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
um so for instance this first bullet

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
here thinking about how people are going

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
to feel about things before you take the

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,240
action

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
i mean it's one thing to realize oh i

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
just stepped on somebody's toes

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,680
but it's another thing to really be

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
thinking about before i take this

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,839
action how are my team members going to

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,040
be

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,320
going to be responding to that because

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,240
that helps us then to

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,880
frame our actions or frame our words

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
in a way that actually is going to be

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
inspirational

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,000
and really going to help people to see

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,360
where we want to go and be proud to work

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
for the team all these things that we

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,000
just talked about in those prior pages

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,880
um thoughtful of others personal needs

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,120
it's not just about doing the work right

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,519
people are not just pairs of hands

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
you know people come you know with their

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
brains attached and they come with

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
all the things that make them human

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
attached to it and

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
so recognizing the fact that it isn't

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
just about doing the work

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,880
it is indeed about us being human

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,399
with each other and working with each

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
other

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,880
and of course the idea of interest

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,520
outside of work

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
right connecting with each other uh and

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
again

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,679
some of us are really really good at

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,640
that i mean it comes really naturally

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,240
for some of us

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,760
and for others of us not so much

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,439
so definitely want to uh

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
here i'm speaking to myself pay

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
attention and

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
think about these things and really be

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,880
very much uh

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,880
connected with them um

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,360
so i'm just noting here that michael put

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,240
a a note in the uh

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,280
chat window here uh going back to the

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
prior page about

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,480
challenging the teams here uh he's also

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
talking about

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,679
uh challenge the corporate antibodies to

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,280
change

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,919
but it's true though there are defense

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
and he mentions the defense mechanisms

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,320
and all of those kind of things and this

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,720
is actually a role of leadership as well

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,840
essentially recognizing what are the

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
parts of the

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,200
organization or what are the attributes

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,120
of the organization

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,039
and the leaders of the organization that

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,080
would actually get in the way

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,200
of people thinking differently people

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,160
stepping outside of their constraints

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,480
so that was a great comment michael

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
thank you

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,360
all right so we have our supportive

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
leadership

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,480
and then there's personal recognition

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,080
um and this is actually the uh the last

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
of the five here

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
and again it's a connection with people

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,919
here and we want to make sure that

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,960
people recognize that we do

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,320
appreciate the work that was done but

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,000
notice that it's not

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,400
just about appreciating over-the-top

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
excellence i mean obviously you always

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,039
want to appreciate

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,600
great excellent work here

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,960
so first off they highlight this idea of

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,160
acknowledging achievement of goals

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,799
and acknowledging any improvements

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
and i love how that one is worded uh the

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,679
idea of

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,840
you know we're better than we were we

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,880
may not have achieved the ultimate we

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,520
may not be

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
uh the most the greatest that we could

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,039
possibly be

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
but we have moved in that direction so

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,720
any improvement

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,480
in what we're doing here uh that is

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
something we also want to recognize

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,919
um especially if we haven't achieved

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
what we ultimately want to achieve here

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
but

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
recognizing that we have made some

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,720
progress

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,360
that is going to stimulate more movement

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
in that same direction here

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,000
uh personally complementing when people

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,880
do outstanding work

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
uh and and literally it is a matter of

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
of

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,200
making it personal right anyone who has

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,559
put in the extra effort you want to make

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,640
sure that they recognize

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,679
that that they know they have been

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
appreciated

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,480
again it goes back to that the human

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,919
side of it

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,240
um so and these bullets

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,600
kind of restate pretty much the same

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,960
things that were there

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,000
so it is a matter of of reaching out

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,400
to the team members and uh making them

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,440
feel

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,799
personally appreciated

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
for the work that they're doing and

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,400
especially anything that that represents

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
either an achievement

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,159
or a move in the direction of achieving

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,520
the kinds of things

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
that we want to try to achieve

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,200
so with that in mind those are the five

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,400
pieces

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,080
of this inspirational leadership that

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,440
we're talking about here

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,460
vision uh inspirational communication

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
intellectual stimulation

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,520
[Music]

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
supportive leadership and of course

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,520
personal recognition

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,640
those are the pieces of inspirational

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,840
leadership

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
now why is this important as i said the

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
data that they

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
came up with in the state of devops

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,280
report highlighted

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
that it actually correlates with the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,919
kinds of things that we're trying to

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,280
achieve

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,120
in our devops implementations here and

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,919
this is kind of how they wrapped it up

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,240
here the transformational leadership

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,159
essentially sets up these things so

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,520
there's the five elements that we just

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,720
talked about there

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,440
but first off it

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
establishes and supports the kind of

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
cultural

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,600
norms that we are looking for we talk

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,039
a fair amount in the devops community

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,919
about culture

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,280
about culture being a necessary part of

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
achieving the kind of things we're

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,720
trying to achieve and

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,080
achieving high i.t performance in our

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
organizations

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,679
and indeed it's this form of leadership

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,360
that does set the stage for those kinds

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,799
of for that kind of a culture a

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,480
generative and high trust culture

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,520
so that's actually one of the first

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,720
reasons why this is necessary

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,760
it also when it comes to

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,080
putting the technologies and tools and

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
the

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,679
new processes and all of those things in

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
place in order to make these things

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,640
happen

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,440
this actually enables those things to

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
happen devops is about rethinking how we

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,760
do our

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,679
work and thinking in a different way and

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,960
embracing new kinds of approaches and

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,320
new tools and new

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,200
new ideas about how to do work and

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,000
indeed

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,760
this kind of a leadership approach

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,559
actually enables

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,200
those kinds of changes to go on so even

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,520
the nuts and bolts technology part

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,640
becomes easier with this kind of

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,440
leadership going on

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
it supports experimentation you know

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,840
when you

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,520
talk about gene kim's three ways the

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,320
third way is

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,880
is experimentation right continuous

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,919
learning

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,240
and experimentation and the

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,720
experimentation

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,280
is actually where you achieve the really

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,760
really big benefits out of devops

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,320
and this is the kind of leadership

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,799
that's going to enable that to happen

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,880
and finally breaking down the silos

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,320
when you have this kind of leadership it

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
actually invites

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,559
people to step outside of whatever silos

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,840
that they might have

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,159
and actually invites people to

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,159
actually break down those silo walls to

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
reach across boundaries and to work with

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,799
other people in the organization in

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,240
order to make all these things happen

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,039
so yes indeed this is why

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
this transformational leadership style

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,159
does

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,559
correlate with high i.t performance and

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,960
does

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,000
correlate with the ability of an

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,960
organization

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,559
to perform well because it indeed it

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
sets us up to be able to

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,320
do the things that we're talking about

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
doing here as part of devops

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,880
so that's what i have here uh i got one

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,840
really good comment from michael thank

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,120
you in the

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,400
in the chat i would welcome

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,159
any other ideas that any of you have and

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
of course any questions that anyone

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:18,320
would like to

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,440
to throw out there

thanks alan that was a really good

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440

so we're done just a few minutes early

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,320

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,080
um alan we appreciate it very much we've

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,440
um appreciate the the remark there

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,159
vanessa

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,679
uh for your kind words um anybody else

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
who wants to chat with alan or ask

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,200
questions uh he's got a few minutes here

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,520
to take your questions so feel free to

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,039
post those in the chat and we'll get you

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,880
connected with them

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,880
um we've got one question

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,440
okay good all right you can see the q a

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,480
so uh so i'll let you

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,640
take that um yeah so uh

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,799
so the the question in the q a is do you

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,720
think an engineering leader necessarily

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,679
has to know how to code to be a good

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,720
leader

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,080
uh from your talk my guess is no and i

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,039
i you definitely read me correctly there

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,559
um obviously a person who has a

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,120
technical background

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,440
uh is going to be able to really connect

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,360
with technical people really well

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,640
uh but no i don't think it's an absolute

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,919
necessity

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
uh for for a technical leader to be a

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,080
technical

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,039
expert in any way and in fact sometimes

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,880
some of the best leaders that you see in

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,400
a technical environment are the people

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,799
who uh

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,960
are not technical experts and in fact

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,000
they make a big deal of

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,600
oh you are the expert and and you know

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,360
you're you're the ones i'm counting on

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
to do this work and i'm providing

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,679
leadership for you

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,600
so uh so definitely you've read me

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,880
correctly on that one

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,600
technical knowledge is useful but not

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,679
necessary

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,799
um so uh and and uh

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,760
so michael threw his uh question into

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,960
the q a

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,240
there uh you know what do you do to

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,240
avoid those corporate

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,840
antibodies so he had put that comment in

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,720
uh in the chat window there

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,000
um i guess i didn't give a direct answer

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,320
on that because i don't have

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,559
any magic that i can that i can quote on

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,039
how to make those kind of things happen

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,559
um so what he says here is uh how do you

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
avoid the corporate antibodies from

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,039
rejecting us

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,679
as change agents my

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,240
favorite approach to that sort of a

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,279
problem

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,440
really comes down to um

00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:55,760
emphasizing whatever

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:59,039
wins that the organization actually gets

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,480
it doesn't guarantee that the

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,600
uh the whoever is is

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
kind of spewing out those antibodies is

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,279
actually going to get it

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,200
and and grasp the idea here and i've

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,840
seen many cases when it doesn't

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,480
but that's the best thing i know of is

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
any

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
any uh benefit that the organization

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,760
gets from some of the things that we've

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,960
done

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,480
broadcast that make it make that uh

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,600
very very visible and that's your best

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,880
hope at winning over support for the

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,039
work that you're trying to do as a

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,840
change agent

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,840
um

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,120
okay so next question is uh how does a

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
servant leader compare or contrast

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,399
to a transformational leader they

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,559
actually

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
specifically mentioned that in the state

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,159
of devops report and i didn't

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,919
i didn't lift that quote from that so i

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
can't actually quote what the report was

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,880
saying here

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,919
um but it boils down to a servant leader

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
is a matter of

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
i am leading the team by supporting the

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,320
team and doing things for the team

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,200
i'm serving the team and that is how i'm

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,799
leading it

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,039
and what they're highlighting is a

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,080
transformational leader is much more

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,200
out in front of the team than a servant

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
leader is

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,360
so they did draw that distinction

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,720
between the two it's the approach

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,880
that's different um they're both

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,559
actually i i think they're both really

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,919
uh positive things

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,440
but a a servant the term servant leader

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,760
does have a more

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,200
um back behind the team we're a

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
transformational leader

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
more out in front so i guess that's the

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,320
big difference

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
and i do point you to the 2019 state of

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
devops report because they

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,840
did have a paragraph in there that

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,840
specifically addresses this

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
vanessa asked do you have any favorite

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,320
productivity tools that you find

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,120
help enable the supportive systems you

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,559
were talking about on your last slide

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,320
um i don't really have a favorite

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,640
tool that i would point to um obviously

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,960
anything that is going to enable the

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
team to collaborate with each other

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,360
and there's a whole raft of tools that

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,399
fall into that category

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,039
i think is going to be a useful thing um

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,520
i mean it's one thing to inspire the

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,200
team

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,799
to to uh to you know reach out for

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,039
better things

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,000
but having the team collaborate having

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,600
the team members connect with each other

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
i think is going to be the best way to

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,760
make that work so don't have a

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,159
particular tool but i would say anything

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
that

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,080
is designed to

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,279
facilitate collaboration i guess would

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,279
be the direction i would go

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,640
any tips on getting more of a vocal

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,240
group i lead a younger devops group

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,080
that can be what i consider shy

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,679
yeah um boy that's a good question here

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,200
um and honestly i

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,440
thinking to my experience in that kind

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,159
of situation i know how frustrating it

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
is

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
and i've never been able to really crack

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,840
that nut

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,799
uh so if any of you actually has a good

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
answer

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,120
uh for ryan on that uh

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,120
please do at uh you know add that to the

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,080
chat or whatever because that's a nut i

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,080
don't know how to crack

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,360
uh so okay michael uh is commenting some

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,399
more

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,520
on the uh the antibodies change

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,720
that is too fast looks like a cancer

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
uh change is scary and it does provo

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
for uh promote those kind of responses

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,360
that's true that's true

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,360
uh change for the most part in most

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,919
organizations you really do have to take

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,279
things

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,279
slow slower to get people on board

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,039
because you're right change is scary

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
uh that's kind of a you know resistance

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,279
to change is something that we always

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,320
talk about

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,840
in the organizational change world most

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,240
people are going to react in a negative

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
way

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,399
when they are facing something that is

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,679
that scary unknown out there

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,240
um so so moving slowly and deliberately

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,440
in addition to the broadcasting of all

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,840
the wins

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,840
i think those things need to go together

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,679
tips on motivating people to get out of

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,679
the box

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,279
and to continue to do it so

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,480
what i like to do is point to examples

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,039
of it i think

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,679
uh you know whenever you see it and it's

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,919
not just

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,640
on the team obviously anyone on the team

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,159
who steps outside of a box i definitely

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
want to highlight that to the whole rest

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,080
of the team

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,600
but even if it's not somebody on the

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,880
team even if it's somewhere else in the

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,559
organization

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,919
or any example you can come up with

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,279
i i think that's the best way is to

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,120
put those things out there as examples

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,799
and you know highlight the fact that

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
yeah this is this is really what we're

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,000
looking for here

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,000
with this kind of situation

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,640
um

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,600
so i'm okay now i'm looking down here at

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,600
the uh the chat window here

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,679
okay so joe says one idea would be to

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,039
get anonymous feedback from team members

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
they might be more comfortable with that

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,240
that's true

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,320
that's true sometimes not speaking

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,760
publicly is the answer especially for

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,039
the more shy

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,279
members of the team in fact okay so

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,919
vanessa says as a shy developer

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,200
myself i felt naturally emerging from my

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,120
shell a little

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,919
more when a trusting environment was

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,919
established yes

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,960
supportive team members had my back

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,279
easier to emerge a little learn and make

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,799
mistakes give me encouragement

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,960
and the the term we use for what vanessa

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,080
is talking about there in the chat

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,279
um is a safety culture where

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,320
you know literally you can step out

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,440
and do something unexpected you can make

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,039
mistakes

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
uh whatever and it's safe for you to do

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,159
it

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
and the only way to really establish a

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,919
safety culture

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,080
is in your own uh reactions to things

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,399
uh but i think that's a really important

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,640
part thank you vanessa you're uh

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,320
definitely uh highlighted a really

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,840
important point

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,840
and chris chris agreed

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,399
yeah paul talks about asking people

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,679
specific questions

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,600
by name uh and sometimes

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,440
people will react very positively to

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,120
that idea of of

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,640
you know being asked a very specific

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,360
question um

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,080
not always sometimes you know the the

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,120
very shy

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,720
people will feel put on the spot so you

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,840
do have to be careful with that kind of

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,760
an approach

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,159
but for many people it actually can be a

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,879
good way to get them to speak up when

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,919
it's kind of funny how often people are

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,919
sitting there think

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,440
should i say this or should i not say

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,839
this or you know

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,839
and an invitation is all they need for

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,839
them to step

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
out

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,480
so so back to the q a here daryl asked

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,720
do you have any good examples of

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,839
transformational leaders or leadership

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,320
in today's tech

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:40,240
culture wow

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,200
you know i i i've read a lot of good

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,760
things about musk

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
you know elon musk uh definitely

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,800
challenges

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,320
his people to think about things in very

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,000
different ways

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,000
some of the um amazing things that the

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,800
company has been able to do

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,160
uh i mean obviously he comes up he's

00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
very much uh

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,839
inspirational when it comes to coming up

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,640
with crazy ideas and then helping people

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,760
to do them

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,520
but you know that his own people

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,839
are thinking outside the box and are

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,640
really coming up with great ideas

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,680
so i i think uh he would be the person i

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,079
would point to

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,839
based on the little i know about him i

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,839
don't know a great deal about him

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,079
all right gabriel says as a young

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
developer

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,000
i've had a lot of situations where i

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,240
feel like my input was shut down

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,400
a variant of shut up kid what do you

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
know

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,200
yeah and and honestly one of the things

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,320
that i've always tried to do

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,520
is um is to recognize

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
and uh appreciate whatever anybody says

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,680
even if

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,040
it's a a suggestion that we can't take

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,880
uh even if it's something we can't do or

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,920
somebody else came up with a better idea

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,320
so we're going to go some other

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,839
direction i still want to

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,320
help people to still feel comfortable

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,800
with

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,960
coming up with their ideas so so uh

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
being appreciative of the idea even when

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,720
it's an idea that we can't do

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,440
uh but i definitely don't want to shut

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,599
somebody down just because they're

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,200
less experienced some of the less

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,200
experienced people come up with the best

00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,599
