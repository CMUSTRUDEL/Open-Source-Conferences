Abstract: There were a lot of things asked of me as a one man dev shop within the District of Connecticut, but the most outrageous one was to scale out a legacy ColdFusion application into something that could be used by courts across the country.

Along the way I managed myself how to use Docker, OpenShift, and eventually ColdFusion. (/rimshot)

Most importantly, though, I learned how big an impact culture has on the success of big objectives. I had the time of my life flying all over the country to speak at internal gov-tech conferences and attend meetings with important folks in D.C. But when it came time to sit down and do the work, I was miserable.

A fun project only provides so much motivation when there's little to no team cohesion, an ingrained culture of indifference, and no sort of mentorship model in place. Regardless, I suffered through it and got the project to a point where I could hand it off before moving on in my career.

However, it taught me important lessons about how to position a team towards tackling outlandishly large goals. The technical know-how is important, but is by no means the most important part of molding a nimble and effective team. Let me share with you what I learned and how it's helping my team at Clarity thrive.

uh my name is henry quinn and this is

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
leading a digital transformation at the

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
speed of government my first job

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
out of college was being the sole

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
programmer for the united states

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,119
district court district of connecticut

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,560
um handling all of our civil criminal

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,400
dockets or hr

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
jury teams which is the cell program

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
we're working on all of our projects

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
out of this beautiful art deco building

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,439
we're sitting on a mountain

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
of data having all this case

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,240
documentation over the past like 80 90

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
years

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,200
and you might be wondering well henry

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,399
what did you build with all that fun

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,399
data you had

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,920
and the answer is absolutely nothing uh

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
you're really backwards thinking for a

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,960
while and the only really interesting

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,640
thing i built was

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
a tool for hr to automate some stuff and

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
i got to go to disney world

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
to talk about it but for a while this

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
wasn't a lot of really innovative work

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,160
going on which is really making me

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
want to start leaving but i was placated

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
with a project

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
something that was made up to keep me

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,480
there it takes about an

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,079
hour for our judges to get started every

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,080
day and multiply it out across the

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
entire country that's about 15 to 20

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
million dollars

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,560
of time just spent trying to log into

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
different systems

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
so we're working on a project to kind of

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,720
collapse all that down but there's some

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
catches it was written in cold fusion

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
um it had to be a static vm and we had

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
to be in 16 quarts by the end of the

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,520
year

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
and again it was written in cold fusion

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,200
in

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
2017 but the bigger problem was that in

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
order to get a court

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
set up it took about a week top to

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
bottom to requisition servers get

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
everything installed get everything

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
configured

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
and we needed to be in 50 courts by the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
end of the next year

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
and taking a week per court that's an

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
entire year of just doing it for work

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
so we started learning about containers

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
i started getting involved in some

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
other judiciary teams in different parts

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
of the country that were starting to

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
work with containers and i started to

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
think this would be a really

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,640
good idea to help launch us forward and

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,920
be able to not have to worry about the

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
infrastructure as much and really to

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
spend our time

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
working on features but my boss was not

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
into it at all

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,040
he didn't like a junior coming onto his

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,119
team taking his baby project and saying

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
we need to architect a little different

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,479
we had to do things on his book there

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,120
had to be static gaps but

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
static gaps are really hard to scale and

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
that's the first step of my leadership

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,000
hierarchy failing me

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,360
we had someone in dc who was acting as a

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
car handler working with the

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
administrative office and he had a lot

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,239
of ideas for what we needed to do even

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,720
though he hadn't really

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
gotten us any amount of funding yet but

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
it kind of got our foot in the door and

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,360
got us talking to some people at a

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
national level

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,239
we learned quickly that it was best to

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
kind of operate in the shadows there are

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
teams all over the country

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
all working in the shadows not really

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
talking about anything publicly until

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
they have a product

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
to present and we learned very quickly

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
that it's easier to go a little rogue

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,440
than the color inside of the lines when

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
you're trying to do government work

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,280
i was one of three people on the planet

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
trying to

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
containerize vue js cold fusion and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
formics and this quote was really what

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
kind of led me down this devops track

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,599
was that my problem was how do i deploy

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,599
this not necessarily how do i build it

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,879
however we eventually made it scalable

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
our handlers loved that

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,400
we started getting money to hire on some

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
more developers and

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,440
we even got invited to help try out a

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
new openshift

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
kubernetes cluster to see if that might

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
be a new thing we can use judiciary-wide

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
to help deploy

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,680
projects but instead of using that money

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,280
to hire more people the

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,800
funding was used to just buy back time

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
for we're already spending

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
uh the folks in dc it's not like they're

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
really on our side but they couldn't

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
really do much besides just

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
cheer us on through this nightmare we

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360
were living in we just didn't have time

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
to work on features

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
we kind of got it eventually to a beta

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
where we were able to

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
scale it with kubernetes we could work

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
locally no matter where we were instead

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
of writing code on one remote server

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,680
um we were able to bang out the rest of

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120
the version one functionality get it

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
through security testing and we're

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,200
finally

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,879
good to go we went the from that week of

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
deployment time all the way down to 10

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
minutes

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
it's a 99.6 optimization i was not

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,599
authorized to make but we suddenly had

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
all that time back to build that new

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,080
functionality

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
i had to step outside my leadership

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
hierarchy in order to fulfill my part of

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
the mission

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
but like a lot of things in government

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
things can go toppling

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
someone really high up in dc retired

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
someone else took their spot

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
and just table cloth trick everything

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
kind of scattered their

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
passion projects output on the priority

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,199
list and we got kind of sidelined

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,960
so we went from being in five courts

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,479
having a plan to be in 50 courts by the

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,160
end of the next year suddenly just

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
fighting for resources to onboard our

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
next three

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,199
we learned that with near unlimited

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
resources we can do everything right

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,199
break all the right rules and still fail

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
we were gonna say 15 million dollars a

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
year but we had to

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
find like a few thousand dollars on our

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
budget just to keep moving

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,479
this is when i decided i needed to leave

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,120
i flew to california

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,800
packed up all my code uh rented a car

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
drove up to seattle

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
it's a really good way to clear your

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,880
head

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
um takeaway though is it i taught myself

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
to code i got all the way to just

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
needing a signature to save

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,479
our government 15 million dollars a year

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
and got the rug yanked out from

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
underneath me and that was before i

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
found my local and global tech groups

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,919
and got involved in the community

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
um the only takeaway i can get from this

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,639
is uh

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
think about what you can do if you take

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
initiative lead from the bottom and step

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
outside of your

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
leadership hierarchy when you need to

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
just like i did and trying to build out

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,479
this project

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,919
so to say thanks for having all of us

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
here today and hope you guys enjoy the

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
