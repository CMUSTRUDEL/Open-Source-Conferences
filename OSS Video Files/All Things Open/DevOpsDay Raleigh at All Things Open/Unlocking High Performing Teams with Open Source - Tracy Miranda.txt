Presented at All Things Open 2020, DevOpsDay Raleigh

Abstract: The Open Source software community has inspired a legion of users and developers that have taken the idea to incredible heights. That's not entirely unique to Open Source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups, user groups and even entire conferences.

However, the Open Source community isn't just a fanbase that is passionately invested, emotionally or financially, in an elite user group; it's made up of the people who facilitate software testing, progressive delivery, and software supply chain management. What can we learn from this community?

By now, most of the IT community has read the “Accelerate State of DevOps” report from DORA and Google. It reveals data and benchmarks about the performance for which all companies aspire to achieve. For example, elite performers are 1.75x more likely to make extensive use of Open Source Software and are 1.5x more likely to be expanding their use of Open Source Software. But how do we get to high performance?

In this talk, I will share how Open Source is the key to unlocking high performance using DORA metrics as a roadmap to achievement. I will share steps in a process such as the adoption of continuous improvement programs, identification of unique constraints, and discovering where you can swarm resources to solve the most critical challenges first. I will also share an experience report of how a team I worked with achieved high performance with Jenkins X.

i'm tracy miranda

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
and i'll be talking to you today about

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,599
unlocking high performing teams with

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,960
open source

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,160
and i think everyone who's here today

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,840
is just looking to up level um their

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,000
game when it comes to

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,279
delivering software and using open

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,760
source and

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
you know if you're looking for kind of

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,800
best practices

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,600
or some advice i'm just happy to share

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
um what what i've been learning and more

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
about

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,520
the continuous delivery foundation which

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,760
i

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,200
help so let's start

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
with some introductions it's a little

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,000
bit about

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
me for those of you who don't know me um

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
just about last month i took on the role

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
of the executive director at the

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
continuous delivery foundation

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,120
which is an open source foundation and

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,080
i'll be talking a bit more about

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,119
what i'm doing in that capacity and

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,520
before that

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,960
i was the director of open source

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
software at

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,680
cloudbees which meant in practice that i

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
got to work very very closely

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,360
with the awesome open source communities

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,880
for the jenkins and jenkins x project

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
and before that i was also involved in

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,840
open source

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
with the eclipse foundation so

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
throughout that community including a

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
spell on

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,000
on the board of directors so all in all

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
i think what i'm trying to say is

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
i'm pretty much a veteran in in open

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
source communities

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
i and this is the reason for that i

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
really love it

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,680
and so huge evangelist um for

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
everything that open source communities

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
have to offer and also want to see them

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
get better and better and include

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,200
some more folks so if you want to reach

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
out to me you can find me on linkedin

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,479
or um at tracy miranda on twitter and i

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,520
also have a blog where i write

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,840
about um careers in tech and you know

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
just

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
how to make sense of that in today's day

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,720
and age

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
but what i will be talking to you today

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,959
about is

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,840
um what does it mean to be a

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,360
high-performing team

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,160
and then building on from that

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
you know knowing what that means how do

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
we go about

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
improving our teams uh how do we

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
leverage

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,840
what's out there today and most

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
importantly what role does open source

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,239
have to play

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
uh in in us becoming better better teams

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
together

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
so let's get started and as i mentioned

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,000
i will be keeping an eye on the chat um

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
so feel free to distract me with

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
questions or conversation things and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:05,120
yeah happy to

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:08,640
build on that as we go

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
great so i just realized

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
okay can folks see the slide that says

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,879
how does it mean what does it mean to be

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
a high performing team

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,480
just making sure i'm updating the right

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,800
slides yes

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
thank you great

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,680
okay so when it comes to being high

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
performing team

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
um we have a very specific definition of

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,959
this today and this comes from

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
the awesome research that was done from

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
the folks from dora

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,159
and what they did was they effectively

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
broke it down

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,879
into these four metrics

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,040
on what you what teams

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
that are considered high performing or

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
we've even got to a point where we can

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,360
talk about elite teams

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,640
do better than the rest and

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,760
these metrics um as you see

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
how frequently do you deploy code what

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,840
is your lead time

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
from the moment you push the code to

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,080
when it gets deployed

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
um those first two are focused on speed

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
and

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,760
then the other two are you know

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
delivering things safely so

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
how long does it take you to recover if

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
something goes wrong

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,960
and you know what is the frequency or

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
the change failure rate

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
of um when you push how often does that

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,880
go wrong

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,000
so the incredible thing about um

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,040
these metrics is that they found um in

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,440
in this research that the teams that

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
were

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
doing it you know were significantly

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
better

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080
than teams that want and you know

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
particularly if you look at the lead

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
time

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
from commit to deploy um you know that's

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,520
at

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,040
2 000 times faster you know we have

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
these things where we talk about 10x

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
developers and things like that

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
and that's all kind of made up yes but

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
here we have

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
real numbers that are talking about how

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
you can and your team can be you know

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,800
two thousand times faster um than

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,520
other folks just by kind of

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,960
following this plan they they laid out

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,320
and before i get into that

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,560
a bit more um here's

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
uh kind of the reference there's the the

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,840
state of devops reports which

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,440
uh also the most recent one is back from

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,800
2019 and

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,000
what you also have is the awesome

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
accelerate book

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
which accompanies those reports and it

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,240
really kind of gives a breakdown

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,199
of the research as well as how you can

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
go about

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
achieving those metrics so this talk i'm

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
not going to talk about like how you

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
would measure those metrics there's lots

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
of awesome folks who

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
who have done that and there was a talk

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
at um cdcon last week i can drop in the

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
link about

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
someone from google talking about how

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,400
you could go about measuring that

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,160
i'm not going to cover that but what i

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,080
will say um in the book i love this

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
quote from nicole forsken one of the

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
authors

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,720
where she says software delivery is an

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
exercise in continuous improvement

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
and our research shows that year over

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
year the best keep getting better and

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,800
those who fail to improve fall further

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,880
and further behind

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
so i think with that point what i want

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,000
to emphasize is

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,680
you know so we have these four metrics

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,960
we know that's what it means to be a

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
high performing team

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,080
but we also know that it does feel a bit

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,560
like you're on a treadmill because

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
um there's all these people who are

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
getting better

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,120
at doing um at these metrics and then if

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
you're

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,199
standing still or you know holding on to

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,479
kind of the way things were done that

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,160
don't help you get better then

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,759
you're you're just falling further and

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,360
further behind even if you think

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:53,199
you know you're just in one place

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,160
so what do you need to do to actually

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,319
um get better and to become that

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
high-performing team

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
so the answers are actually pretty much

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,240
laid out in the accelerate book and so

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
it's an awesome book

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
it is kind of this defining software

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
book of our time

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
i highly recommend people read it but if

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,479
you

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,840
aren't going to get around to reading it

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:19,120
i'm going to summarize

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,560
um the capabilities on this slide

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,319
so the book outlines 24

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
capabilities which drive improvement

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
and they divide them up into different

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
categories

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
and what you'll see on on the left in

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
this diagram

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,080
is that one third of those capabilities

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,000
are all grouped in this set of practices

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,280
that are referred to as

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,720
continuous delivery capabilities

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,120
and so that is like continuous delivery

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
is

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,919
is kind of where i'm coming in from and

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
that's kind of the high level

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,360
things we want to focus on so some of

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,280
the other

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
capabilities you'll see they fall under

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
architecture or product and processor or

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
lean management

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,479
and then there's also things on

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
leadership which are covered in the

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,039
kind of cultural capabilities

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,560
so it isn't just you know there's no

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,319
kind of silver bullet there's not just

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
this one thing you have to do all

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,160
this one great trick it's actually

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,520
getting a lot of these things

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,560
done well and done well together

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,120
and this is where i'll kind of go into

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
a bit more

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,440
so um before i get

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,760
into more on on kind of continuous

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,800
delivery and tying it into open source

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
i just want to talk a little about

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
some terms which especially if you're

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
new to

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
the whole space they tend to be used a

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,120
bit interchangeably and

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,360
often quite confusingly and i know for

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,680
the benefit of any folks who are kind of

00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,720
new to the whole devops or

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,240
ci cd i just want to spend kind of a

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,600
minute

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
talking about some high level

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,800
differences

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
so you'll often see the terms agile and

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,880
cicd

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,600
and devops kind of used

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,040
in in kind of different ways with

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
different meanings

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,200
but there is a a lot of overlap in them

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,279
but each one kind of has its own history

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,560
and each one tends to highlight

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,200
a slightly different um emphasis on a

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,279
slightly different area

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
sorry just notice this slide is missing

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
there's a reference to a document where

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,880
this is from

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,519
a blog post and i will when i share the

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,959
slides so

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
i'll make sure that's there i don't know

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,680
where that's disappearing

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
but the one thing i want to say is um so

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,120
while agile focuses

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,360
a lot on kind of processes and you have

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,839
devops will often

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,839
lead with culture and what you do need

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,959
to do on the people side

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
when it comes to cicd or as i prefer to

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
call it

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,519
continuous delivery as an umbrella of

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
practices

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
that is really focused on on kind of the

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,600
tooling side of things

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
so it doesn't happen in isolation but

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
there's a lot more emphasis

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,320
on you know how do you go about

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
automating things and how do you go

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
about

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,640
delivering software and what are the two

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
tools you need to do to do that

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
um and then if we had to talk about

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,160
continuous delivery

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,880
um just specifically and just give a

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
very

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,880
kind of simplified definition it's

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
you know a practice where teams want to

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
keep

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,519
their software ready to be delivered at

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,079
any time it typically

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
involves kind of a continuous cycle

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
where you're coding building testing and

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
deploying

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,320
and typically i'd see continuous

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
integration as part of that

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
so that would be one step where the

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
teams can commit

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,399
um repeatedly and those changes are

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
integrated into the main line

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
or the trunk uh in in a regular fashion

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
which is

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
you know the evolution from once upon a

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,880
time where we

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,640
people would just save their software um

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,959
and develop in silos and then bring it

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,839
all together all at once and then just

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,240
have enormous pain trying to put that

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
together

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,920
so we kind of know what

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
continuous delivery is it's it's pretty

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,279
well

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
set out what some of the practices are

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
we have the accelerate book

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
which spells it out and the other part

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,640
of the puzzle is

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,560
is kind of the benefits and again

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,880
going back to accelerate they really

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,200
paint a picture of the benefits you can

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,279
have by implementing continuous delivery

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,880
practices

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,920
so like if you had to imagine

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,600
what your organization would look like

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,160
implementing these practices you

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
you need to picture an organization that

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,560
delivers

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
new features faster than its competition

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
or you might be picturing an

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
organization that

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
takes advantage of fast feedback from

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,480
its um

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
its customers or its clients to really

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
build

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
a very deep relationship with them so

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
they can respond to anything that

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,959
they're seeing or they

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
they're bringing up or you might picture

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,240
an organization that can

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,320
pivot very very quickly to changes uh

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
in the industry or in fact changes in

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
the world as we've seen with

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,079
um the pandemic so

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,160
there's all sorts of benefits that you

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,760
know the research really spells out

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,920
um make a big difference and

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,680
there's one in addition to all of those

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,160
that i think is is probably

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,440
kind of more important than all those

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
other benefits

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,680
and that's kind of the benefit it means

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,040
for individuals as well

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,519
and this is all to do with with burnout

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
and so we have this we also know that if

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,040
you kind of automate the software

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
delivery then the teams who are involved

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,519
with that

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,760
are less likely to to be burnt out

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,959
and the more investment you make in

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
implementing

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,000
uh automation in this area the better it

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,560
is ultimately for your team

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,079
so i think beside this combination of

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,639
kind of the benefits of the business

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,839
but really the benefits um for the

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,240
individual as well

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,920
especially you know i don't know how

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,600
you're finding things at the moment but

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
you know i know from personal experience

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
things are pretty hard right now there's

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
lots of

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,440
craziness in this world and the least we

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,880
can kind of ask from our organization is

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
that you know we're not having to stress

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
out

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,160
um about things which we can kind of get

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,560
under control and get

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
get automated in a way that that just

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
keeps the stress away

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:57,440
so knowing these benefits and

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,360
knowing um how we get there like

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
it's a big question of okay why aren't

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,320
we just all doing that

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
you know why haven't we already adopted

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
all these things why haven't we

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,839
taken advantage of all this kind of

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,959
amazing stuff

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,480
and i think this comes down to um

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,519
three key reasons and the first reason

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,519
um is related to kind of this shift

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,720
we've had in the industry

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,639
where we've sort of worked out that

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
to to kind of better implement these

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,600
practices it makes more sense

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
to move away from monolithic code bases

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,760
and to divided things up into more

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
microservices

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,120
and then on top of that we've got this

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,480
whole set of technologies

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,800
um which make it better to work in

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
distributed environments and it

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
really takes full advantage of of the

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,720
cloud so we have cloud native

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,199
technologies things like kubernetes and

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,920
that whole ecosystem

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,959
really give us huge huge benefits when

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,880
it comes to

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,240
you know particularly scaling and being

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,560
able to kind of

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,639
ramp up or down but

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,079
um with those changes it does mean

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
there's a proliferation

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,000
of environment so now we're having to

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,360
deliver to more environments in general

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,079
we have to contend with things like

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
containers and we have to change

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,680
some of the fundamental ways we have of

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,040
working

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,160
and the second thing with these changes

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,279
that's also resulted in

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,800
a very very fragmented um tool landscape

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
so you'll find there's lots of new

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
tooling coming around trying to take

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
advantage of

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,680
containers and microservices and cloud

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,680
native technology

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
but they don't the tools don't

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,399
necessarily work well together and it's

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
not necessarily

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,920
clear what each tool does partly because

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
we

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,680
aren't necessarily clear about what we

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
mean by different terms in the industry

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,079
and people will kind of use the same

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,279
terms to mean lots of different things

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,920
so that's

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,759
an additional challenge and then finally

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,839
the third thing is

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
um simply that change is hard and i love

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
that michael wolff has

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,240
put that all in caps in the chat because

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
change

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,560
is hard um this

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,519
a limit it feels to how much an

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,160
organization

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,880
or an individual can be asked to do and

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,560
to change

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,279
in a short space of time um

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,920
especially like if you don't have a good

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,800
reason why that's happening

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
that being said um in this time with

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,680
kovid

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,079
and the pandemic we have all

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,440
pushed ourselves to the max we've all

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,120
learned to

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
kind of wash our hands as if we're going

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
into surgery we've learned how to not

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
touch our faces we've learned how to

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,800
wear a mask

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,720
well most of us have learnt how to do

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,000
that not everybody but

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,320
uh i'm gonna guess most people here have

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
and i think what makes the difference is

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,240
that we know

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
when it's important and we know when it

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
matters

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,560
um and then we can kind of do these

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,600
incredible things and we can

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,839
change not just as individuals but as an

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,679
ecosystem or as a community

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,360
as people so

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,240
these kind of reasons

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,319
were this real strong motivation for

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,439
kind of a new open source community

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,360
um that came to life uh in march

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,400
2019 and this is the continuous delivery

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,039
foundation

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
and it was formed um as the home of some

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,880
key open source projects

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
uh so you may all have heard of this

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,240
project called jenkins

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
uh and then it's cloud native

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,480
counterpart jenkins x

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,799
spinnaker the incredible technology that

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
netflix uses to deliver software

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,640
and techton which came out of google and

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,320
the k native uh serverless platform

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,919
so the idea here was not just to house

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
these open source projects and help them

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,160
to be more sustainable

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,679
but also to help create an ecosystem

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,120
where we could all come together and

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
kind of figure out

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,640
how to take advantage of kind of modern

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,880
software delivery

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
um and just appreciate you know all our

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
businesses are becoming driven by

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,480
software

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,000
um but when it comes to change this is

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
super hard and unless we're doing it as

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
a community

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,840
it just continues to be really really

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
challenging

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,840
so when cdf first started

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
um you know we sort of saw that

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,600
community as

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
a home for this next set of continuous

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,240
delivery

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,799
collaboration and set of tools and we we

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,520
sort of started off down that path

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,440
and you know got together with a lot of

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,400
the key folks from the projects

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,320
as well as some folks from the industry

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
uh jane girl from the devops institute

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
and just humble

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,120
uh who was one of the co-authors of

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
accelerate

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,640
were happy to come in and advise um and

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
just

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,919
help us kind of find our way and our

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,799
direction

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,799
and i think we're getting

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,520
to a better place where we're looking at

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,559
the continuous delivery foundation

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,720
as our ultimate mission is to

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
help improve the world's capacity to

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,320
deliver software with security and

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,919
speed and

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,840
um so i think this comes down to you

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,320
know what can we do

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,919
to help people get better at being high

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
performing in terms of those metrics

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
around security and speed

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
and how do we do that and come together

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,919
as an open source community and help

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
each other

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
so what i'm going to spend a little bit

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,000
of time is just talking about a few ways

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,480
that

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
we're doing that and how that means you

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,320
can take advantage of open source

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,320
uh in a more effective way

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,919
um okay i'm distracted by the comments

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,280
so i'm just seeing the the creating the

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
conditions for change

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,840
is also hard coming from craig cook

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,159
and um yeah i really love that because

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,960
um and just to diverge for a minute

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,480
um when if you've ever been in a

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
position where you're trying to convince

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
people

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
to do something differently and i've

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
done that a lot with open source

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,799
um you know there's a number of things

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
that that really

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,320
make a difference and some of that is

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,400
you know

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
about being persistent and uh

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
championing things

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,799
and other things is about like you said

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,039
the conditions for change

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,720
and sometimes that condition is what is

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,120
the rest of the industry doing what is

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,400
the environment you're existing in

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,760
um so i think this kind of plays into it

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
of saying

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,440
how do we how people understand

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
continuous delivery

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,159
is super important how do we help them

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,240
understand

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,240
how to approach it today that things

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
have changed and what you were doing 10

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,360
years ago

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
where you may have thought you had your

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
whole delivery flow

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,919
sorted because everyone's been

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,919
delivering software forever that was

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,600
good so why does it matter why do things

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,400
have to change

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,480
in this new world and i think this this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,200
all kind of comes together

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,679
to to these topics i'm talking about

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
so it's super important and we want to

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,559
drive

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
for adoption and we want to help people

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,760
do that

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
so one of the things i'm going to

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,919
highlight that we're starting to try and

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,200
figure out

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,120
is the

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,919
this whole landscape so i talked about a

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,080
kind of fragmented landscape before

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,440
and um the continuous delivery

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,240
foundation is putting together

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
its own kind of landscape of the tools

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,760
needed

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,159
um for a continuous delivery solution so

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,880
we've

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,480
taken inspiration from the cloud native

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,280
so the cncf have their

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,440
landscape um sometimes affectionately

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,600
called hellscape because it's grown to

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
kind of be this all-encompassing set of

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,320
projects which is

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,480
you know helps give you sort of a scale

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,440
sense of scale of the problem but here

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
we're zooming in

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,440
on the different things that help

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
contribute to its continuous delivery

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
this is still

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,880
a kind of version 0.1 but the important

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,480
thing to note is kind of

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,640
setting out the different categories of

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
tools you know what are the different

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,039
things

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,760
um and types of things you'll need it's

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
not just ci cd i hate that term because

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
people think okay you do

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
some ci continuous integration and then

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
you do some

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,760
continuous delivery or deployment and

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
then you're done you know you've

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,400
delivered software well done

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,840
um fight yourself on the back but

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
really there's a whole set of things

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
that come together and um

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,400
the forgotten cousins tend to be

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,960
security and testing

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
um so those need to kind of play play a

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,400
bigger role

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,320
in continuous delivery and you will

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
notice that there isn't a category on

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,679
here that is a specific

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,919
kind of continuous delivery category

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
um i think there's a bit of nisnoma in

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,880
the industry so pipeline orchestration

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,640
is what

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,159
uh people mean when they they say

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
continuous delivery tools

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,600
but really continuous delivery is the

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,320
entire practice

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,320
so all of these tools help towards that

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,880
practice so it includes

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
um you know that list from accelerate

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,919
and it includes

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,520
testing and it includes continuous

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,880
integration and it includes motion

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,280
control

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,200
so um this landscape is that start of

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,960
trying to give people that realistic

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
picture of what you need to do and then

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
maybe a few

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,120
pointers to some of the tooling in the

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,039
area that can help you

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,880
and then also breaking that up into

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
thinking about it in either cloud native

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
or kind of traditional

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,480
sense and this is totally open source so

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,840
if you want to add a tool or add a

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
contribution or

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,600
help us evolve it i encourage you to

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
keep to get involved

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,400
okay so the second thing is around

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,039
open source projects in this space so

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
as i mentioned um cdf uh started with

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,679
some four incredible

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,960
projects uh jenkins spinnaker

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,919
tecton and jenkins x and then after

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,480
i think last year we accepted our first

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000
um

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,440
other project which is screwdriver

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,440
um but when we talk about these projects

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,080
uh one thing to note is that we have

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,880
these projects

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,600
and they're at different ends of the

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,840
adoption

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
life cycle so you've got projects like

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
jenkins and spinnaker and

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
lots of folks are using that you know

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,039
jenkins

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
much more than anything else and you

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,320
know everybody's heard of it everybody's

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,760
got some sort of automation

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,320
running in jenkins and then spinnaker is

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,159
also

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
being increasingly used at different

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
enterprises

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,919
but then at the other end of the

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,440
spectrum you have um kind of jenkins x

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,200
and tecton which are both these cloud

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,480
native technologies

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,000
and they are really kind of being

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,080
used by the early adopters and the

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
innovators people who have just started

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,440
to

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
adopt kubernetes and now are trying to

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
figure out okay

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
what does what do the pipelines look

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
like how do i pull that together how do

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,799
i really take advantage

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,320
of this incredible scaling that comes

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,919
with this platform

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,159
and those are still kind of in very

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,120
early stages they're part of a very fast

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,240
changing

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,880
um kind of industry and an environment

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,000
so

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,320
there's a lot that prevents them

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,080
today from you know having wider

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,440
adoption but it's something we

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,640
should see more and more

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,760
so um before i go more into some

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,400
on jenkins accent tecton would it um i

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
do want to

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
hop back to accelerate and the state of

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,799
devops report to say

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,559
that again um one of the things we see

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,799
high performers do is leverage

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,600
open source software and the data in

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
that report

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
talks about kind of this elite

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
performers

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
level which is kind of the highest level

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,679
they leverage and

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,679
plan to expand use of open source

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,159
software

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,240
and in general early performers are much

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
more likely to make extensive use of

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
open source software

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,200
and to be expanding the use of open

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,000
source software

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,720
and a couple of reasons um this comes

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
down to

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,400
and which i'll sort of spell out with

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,440
some specific examples from the projects

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,559
but on

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,760
the one hand um it is

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,600
about um

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
you know when you adopt open source and

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,080
especially if you stay on

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,400
kind of more cutting edge projects and

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
you're able to to kind of adopt things

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
coming out

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,919
it means you're always dealing with your

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,799
technical debt

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,799
and then the other thing is you know you

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,000
you get to take advantage of

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,400
uh typically a community that's growing

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,279
and

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
changing so you get to take advantage of

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
learning

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,520
and in a very short space of time uh

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,080
what's happening

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,880
there so this is kind of those are my

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,559
add-ons

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,880
um which i'll kind of go into more

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,640
details but at a very high level

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
we know kind of high performance

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,279
leverage open source software

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,000
and yeah i have a few theories as to why

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,000
that is true

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,720
so going back to um

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,240
you know how do we get better at

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
delivering software securely

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
and at seat we have this whole list of

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,320
24 things

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,000
and then the question i want you to ask

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,039
yourself is

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,240
for the things on this list which of

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,279
those

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,600
um are things that you have to change

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,039
about

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,559
the culture and your team and which of

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,360
those you are things that you can

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,640
actually get

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,679
tooling to help you um

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,120
so can tools help

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,960
it's my quick question and um to answer

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,000
that myself i will say

00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,080
yes and i think there's some specific

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
areas where tooling simplifies

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,559
or certainly opinionated tooling can put

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,200
you down a better path

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,120
um especially if they the tooling was

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
built with these things in mind from the

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,440
beginning

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
and to give a more specific example of

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,320
that

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,240
um so the jenkins x project

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,039
um is a project that was written in an

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,840
era since accelerate book was written

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,440
and the the folks who wrote that um

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,760
james strachan and james jolling

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,039
um i think i know are big fans of the

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,240
accelerate book

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
and so they were looking to see which of

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,679
those

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,320
capabilities um can be encapsulated in a

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,440
tool to

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,159
to a certain extent so it makes life

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
easier

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,159
um and you know on the left on the right

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,080
on the right you've got um kind of seven

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
capabilities there and there's a blog

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,120
post there which talks specifically

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,320
about

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,919
how um jenkins x is designed to make

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,960
these practices kind of de facto

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,720
so by using um tools like this

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,200
you know it supports being able to

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,919
version control all of the artifacts

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,440
um through things like githubs and it

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,000
supports ways to fully automate your

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
deployment

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,600
purposes and i will go into each of

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,480
these but i do encourage you to take a

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,760
look at that blog post

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,080
and and it's

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,039
through leveraging um some of these

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
things that you

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,200
fully start to be able to take advantage

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
of the the new cloud native technologies

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
so

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,360
um you can have this true

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,320
automation um and you can have

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,919
everything kind of

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,360
tracked in version control through

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,240
through get ups

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,760
uh when we talk about scaling in

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,080
practice what does scaling mean

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,880
scaling means well you know you can go

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,600
ahead and

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,520
build every pull request and into a

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,720
preview environment so you can

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,720
look at what that looks like before um

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,840
you kind of approve the code or merge it

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,399
so everything is kind of

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,840
shifting left to happen much earlier in

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,880
the cycle

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
and you can have things like chat ups

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,120
integration so

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
you know modern continuous delivery kind

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,559
of looks

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,840
a lot different than than what we've had

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,760
in the past and it really is about

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
taking advantage of all these different

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,399
features

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,799
so this is kind of one of the things

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,640
when we talk about um you know being

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,080
better high performing by taking

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,960
advantage of the

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,240
the latest tooling uh it's projects like

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,799
jenkins x which

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,559
um help with that and one of the ways it

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,080
does it surprisingly enough

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,399
or not is that jenkins x leverages

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
other open source projects um so in the

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,840
same way in our companies and in our

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,360
organizations we should be

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,679
looking at what's out there and um using

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,320
open source projects jenkins x does that

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,960
by pulling together

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,360
all kind of tools in this space and

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,919
making them work well together

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,519
so this size um back to the continuous

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,000
delivery foundation one of our

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,760
aims is to foster greater tool

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,559
interoperability

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,200
and a lot of that at the moment looks

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,559
like

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,760
um trying to leverage the tacton

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,200
project so tecton is a set of building

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,159
blocks

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,720
which jenkins x actually uses uh to

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,679
build on top of kubernetes um the ci cd

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,960
pipelines

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,080
so there's this awesome toilet analogy

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,640
where jenkins x is the porcelain and

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,559
tecton is the plumbing

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,559
and i won't say what that means about

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,799
what is being delivered

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,080
uh but you can figure that out for

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,159
yourself

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,279
but yeah techton is just this incredible

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,159
project

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,519
um which again it goes back to you know

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,440
if you're familiar with open source

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,760
you've seen it time and time again

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,799
instead of reinventing the wheel can we

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,880
just

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
um offer these standardized building

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,159
blocks

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,240
so techdown is for engineers who are

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,519
building ci cd systems and they want

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
them to be scalar

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,600
scalable and serverless and cloud native

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,120
and we want to

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,600
you know encourage folks to use that

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
instead of writing things from scratch

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
again

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,799
writing their own custom resource

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,399
definitions in kubernetes

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,200
and um so it's not just jenkins x that

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,320
uses it

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,240
we know like the k native project from

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,519
google are using it

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,159
ibm and red hat are using it puppets

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,159
using it

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,720
as their basis for for their relay

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,320
project i just saw a

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,760
lovely project from ebay where they're

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,440
kind of rewriting

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,039
uh things in microservices and they're

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,039
leveraging tacton

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,640
so i think this is another way open

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
source really makes a big difference to

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
the industry where

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,480
if we can all kind of agree to use

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,679
shared building blocks and to have them

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,519
more portable and interoperable then um

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
we can really kind of get to the next

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
stage of where we're innovating and

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,000
we're not just reinventing the wheel

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,000
over and over again

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,840
um so in general we have a set of

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,880
like-minded folks

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,120
in cdf who are all about driving for

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
common apis and metadata and trying to

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,679
figure out you know

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
can we provide these standardized

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,720
building blocks

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,320
for shared ap apis and

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,240
that comes in the form of the

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,360
interoperability special

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
interest group which is a community

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,480
driven initiative

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,399
set up by folks from the community and

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,840
is open for anyone to join

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,399
so you can check out the github page

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,760
and it's a super great group doing some

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,519
really good work

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,200
one of the first things that sort of

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,600
worked out is that everybody was using

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,039
the same terms for for different things

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,480
so we had to just start out by

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,320
establishing this kind of shared

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
vocabulary which we called the the

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,880
rosetta stone

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,080
for cicd so just understanding why

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,919
different projects

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,600
what the different terms are and whether

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,039
they're the same or different

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,000
and not just in pipeline orchestration

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,559
tools but also

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
kind of version control tools and again

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,960
that's something open that you can

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
contribute

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,720
your own tools or terminology too and

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,440
kind of be part of that

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,440
conversation

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,079
okay so um

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,879
from there i really want to

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,800
kind of encourage you to

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,000
get involved with the various things we

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
have at the continuous delivery

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
foundation

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,879
there are a whole bunch of other things

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,919
but i think i want to focus

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,639
on the areas where we think um not only

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,200
help

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
teams to get better at being high

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,720
performing

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,240
but also if you take this wider view of

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,320
the industry and scale up you say you

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,960
know how can we be more effective

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,800
as communities in in kind of using

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,079
what's out there and working together

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,079
and helping people get better

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,720
and i'm gonna just wrap it up

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,200
with a few concluding thoughts

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,240
and then see if we've got any questions

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,240
anything from the audience

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,560
so to conclude um

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
you know i think when it comes to high

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
performing teams we all want to get

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,800
there

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,960
accelerate tells us how to do that and

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,720
what our challenge is is to figure out

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,200
which of those can we

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,040
kind of leverage open source tools to do

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
and get better at and which of those

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,720
you know and then free ourselves up to

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,640
work on the really hard things of

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,640
changing people and changing cultures

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,200
and if i had to summarize

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,359
kind of what i want you to take away

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,520
from this talk um

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
is that we we know what it means to be a

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,640
high-performing team

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,920
uh it's kind of spelt out in in the

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,400
metrics

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,280
and accelerate book gives us the high

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,720
level steps

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,320
to unlock this high high performance

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,000
and as we see continuous delivery

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,880
practices are key to that so

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
about a third of the of the things you

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,280
want to do

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,680
fall under this umbrella of continuous

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,760
delivery practices

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,960
that being said uh what you think you

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,480
might know has changed with

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
microservices and cloud native

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,359
technology

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,280
i've changed the game for all of us so

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,280
in many ways we're all kind of

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,520
trying to figure it out again in this

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,800
distributed environment

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,440
uh change is is pretty challenging

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,480
but once again open source um can come

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
to the rescue there

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,200
so uh you can look at adopting open

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
source technologies like jenkins x and

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,480
techton

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,560
to make the most of what modern software

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,160
delivery has to offer

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,000
and then the other side of that is just

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,320
by joining open source

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
communities it will really help make

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,599
your continuous

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,359
improvement journey easier uh if you

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,960
want to create that environment to help

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,359
bring about change you'll get support

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,200
from other people in the same boat

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,320
we're doing a lot of that at the

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,359
continuous delivery foundation

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,880
so um i'll finish with a plug to say you

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,119
know just get involved with

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,200
our community either with specific

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,520
projects or the interoperability group

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,520
we also have an engineer council

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,119
for folks who are trying to figure out

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,240
things around you know

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,119
compliance and governance and developer

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,680
experience um so just reach out to me

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,119
and happy to give you some pointers

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,119
uh we just had our first cd con

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,640
kind of last uh two weeks ago

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,119
and these were kind of some of the

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,520
selfies so um they they are

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,400
lots of great people who are part of the

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,440
community and all happy to come together

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,560
and work together and finally if i kind

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,400
of had to summarize

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,960
um what we're all trying to do is we're

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,680
trying to get better at doing continuous

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
delivery

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,520
we're trying to leverage open source and

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
everything that open source stands for

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,560
the transparency the collaboration the

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,880
innovation

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,359
um we're really driving to have a much

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,079
more kind of diverse community which is

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,920
open to kind of the next generation of

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,200
folks who are contributing

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,359
and i think if you put those all

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,400
together um you know that's really where

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,280
i see cdf being and the direction will

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,720
be going

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,119
in open source so

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,640
finally um good luck with your journeys

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,280
and becoming high performing team

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,359
and yeah i welcome you to join uh the

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,040
continuous delivery foundation

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,920
and uh just help let us help you in the

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,920
journey to getting there

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,480
okay so um i'm gonna leave it there and

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,200
see if we can find the questions

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:47,839
[Music]

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:47,839
so anybody have any questions

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,280
okay i don't see any questions in the q

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,320
a so

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,320
i might go overseas

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,400
that's really nice feedback thank you

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,760
michael and i

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,280
will drop um i will just go and save a

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,440
link to the slides in here

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,040
actually folks one i'm sure there'll be

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,280
a way to find them but you can start

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,960
with this

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,440
great that would be awesome thanks for

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,960
uh sending that and tracy thank you for

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,119
a great presentation

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,640
really super informative and thank you

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,240
all for joining us

presentation for today

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,400
which is best practices in implementing

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,079
container image promotion pipelines by

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,319
baruch saragoruski

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,839
so thanks for joining us and yeah please

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,200
send over some questions

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,839
if you have any see michael

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,839
says i have a question

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,440
i am currently working on an embedded

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,800
real-time system that

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,280
operates off the network i can't use

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,560
some of the technology but what kinds of

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,400
practices

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,319
can i use uh no problem

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,560
okay so um i'm guessing and just

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,520
drop in the chat if you're saying you're

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,040
saying you can't use some of the

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,079
technologies i'm guessing because this

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,280
is not um

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,200
strictly cloud native um

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,680
but i think you can like put am i still

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,040
showing

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,040
i think i'm still sharing the screen

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,960
i'm thinking about delivering small

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,960
changes no big bang delivery

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,560
yeah i think like if you look at the

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,760
capabilities and

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,520
you know probably one of the most

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,800
controversial ones on there is number

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
four which is about

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,280
trunk based development and it's really

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,520
about

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,280
you know doing these small changes so is

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,760
that something

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,680
um in there are you trying to switch

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,839
folks from big bang to

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
actually doing small changes in in a

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,839
more focused way where you don't have

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,839
long-lived branches

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:43,280
i'm gonna wait for you to answer that um

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,599
yeah one two year delivery cycles

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,880
okay yeah i think just helping your

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,359
organization understand

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
that that doesn't work uh in today's

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,480
world

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,000
and i'm pretty sure there's even in the

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,240
embedded space i used to work in

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,599
in that area they are folks who are

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,520
getting better and better and

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,520
that you know software delivery is going

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,040
to be the differentiator

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,119
um so one of the things about the

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,240
research was that it

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,480
like the it didn't matter which industry

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,079
they were people high performers in

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,119
different industries so

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,119
i think you will find that as much as

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,200
some organizations like to make out that

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,760
it's all about the industry

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,480
um it's not the case um so these

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,079
practices

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,079
can be applied regardless of what

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,760
industry and they can to an extent be

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,760
applied regardless of um what

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,520
like programming languages uh i know

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,319
folks who use kobold who will

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,680
you know deliver twice a week or even

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,720
more frequently

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,119
and um i think it is all about kind of

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,960
just getting the team set up and well

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,200
really meeting all these requirements on

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,200
there

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,079
right given regulatory beliefs they do

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,079
not see that it can be done like this

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,400
um

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:07,119
microservices okay

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,760
yeah so i think um this is a great point

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,640
about like i love how you put beliefs in

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,920
quotes because i think one thing we want

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,359
to get better at

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,839
especially is if you're bringing about

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,160
change is is kind of debunking

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,000
what are the myths um in organization

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,680
and what is the reality

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,960
so like people will often put up these

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,880
barriers which are kind of pretty

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,280
sort of set in stone many people believe

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,880
them but they aren't necessarily true

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,359
and i think this is where community

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,640
helps as well we do have an end user

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,119
council where

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,960
we get together and people compare notes

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,640
on what it actually means

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,400
and we you know we have some folks from

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,480
regulated industries

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,079
so i think this is that tends to be a

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,440
good way as well of knowing you know

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,040
what is the reality of

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,520
industries um most

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,240
of them like i think they are some key

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,280
ones where it

00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,599
is a blocker for some things but in

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,880
in many cases uh it's not the case let

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,680
me drop a link to our end user console

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,359
and if that's something um there's a way

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,240
to get in touch if you want to join it

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,119
and then

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,599
i think my best recommendation is find

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,960
folks

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,400
in your industry who are doing things

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,000
um in in kind of a more high performance

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,640
way and kind of leverage that

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,079
to take it back to your organization to

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,960
kind of beat them over the head with it

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,200
because

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,640
i'm going to guess half the things you

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:37,680
that are being set up as various are

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:39,760
just not realistic barriers

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
