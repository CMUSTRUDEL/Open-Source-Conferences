Abstract: Delivering complex microservice applications that rely on lots of interconnected services is a lot easier than it used to be. Thanks to Kubernetes and Helm, we can drastically reduce the barriers to continuous delivery. In this talk, we’ll show how real teams bring all the pieces together to build software faster and deliver higher quality code at scale. 

Using these real strategies, teams have been reducing their mean time to recover (MTTR), change lead time, change failure rates and improving their own mental health. We’ll marry Shift Left, GitOps, CI, and CD together for a comprehensive strategy.
