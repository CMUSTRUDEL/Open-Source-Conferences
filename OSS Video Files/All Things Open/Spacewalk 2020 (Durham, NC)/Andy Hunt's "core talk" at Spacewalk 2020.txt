00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,429
he started but I'm gonna say thanks for

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,650
coming out I took one look at the

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,750
temperature was gonna let my dog out the

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,810
dogs like I'm waiting till about March

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,189
we're not doing this so yeah I wouldn't

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,650
have come tonight if I didn't you know

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,140
sort of have to so thanks

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,300
my name is Andy hunt I have been

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,239
programming commercially for money for

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,680
38 years

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,110
I shouldn't say that anymore that sounds

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,579
kind of horrible and one of these days

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm gonna figure out how it actually

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,539
worked and and how to do it right I'm

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,270
still working on that so back in the mid

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,710
90s towards the end of the 90s Dave

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,059
Thomas and I wrote the pragmatic

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,289
programmer book which I'll tell you

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:02,850
about in a second and then in the early

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:04,379
2000s like 2001 I guess it was 2000 we

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,270
wrote the the pickaxe

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,310
the ruby programming book which sort of

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,369
introduced Ruby to the to the rest of

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,320
the world and then this little thing

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:17,009
happened where as one of the authors of

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,250
the agile manifesto trying to to get

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,860
people to think beyond the sort of rigid

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,020
linear bureaucratic plan based

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,960
approaches and do something more

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,060
effective a little while after that Dave

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,310
and I founded the pragmatic bookshelf

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,549
publishing company which is my

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,530
quote-unquote day job these days I run

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,229
the publishing company which is an

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,110
interesting experience to sort of be at

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,420
the whatever metaphor you want to use to

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,869
be at the crossroads to have your finger

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,579
on the pulse of what people are excited

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,369
about what people are interested in what

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,399
people think are important enough to

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,729
devote nine to 12 months of their life

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,030
writing a book about that's some serious

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,380
commitment and you really only want to

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,840
undertake something like that if you are

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,869
really really passionate about the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,450
subject matter so that's an interesting

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,620
data point to kind of see what's going

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,160
on in the world

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,430
and there's a lot going on in the world

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,849
especially these days as they say so as

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,800
Dave and I set out to do a 20th

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,220
anniversary edition of the pragmatic

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,730
programmer book it was a bit of a time

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,519
capsule to go back and see well what was

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:40,739
the development world like back in the

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:44,010
late 90s versus today and an awful lot

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,390
has changed right so think back to those

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,400
days you know say 98 97 98 or so

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,220
dinosaurs roamed the earth right grazing

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,310
under the window peacefully and the

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,950
dinosaurs were named Lycos AltaVista

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,080
right those were the search engine

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,190
Giants everyone was really worried about

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,260
this huge Monopoly called AOL that was

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,290
oh it was horrible they carpet-bombed

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:15,030
you with it with CDs it was it was

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,860
devastating and you know it's a

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,180
different Google what Google was not a

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,709
verb you know that wasn't a thing it was

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,810
a very different world but a lot of

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,359
things as we notice going through the

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,450
book a lot of things haven't changed

00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:34,470
anything to deal with us as people as

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:37,530
individuals as programmers developers we

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,630
haven't changed in tens of thousands of

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,239
years hundreds of thousands of years the

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,989
tech has changed but you know it always

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,540
does so back in the 90s

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,870
what happened was we did not set out to

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,950
write a book at all let alone eight but

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,250
what did Todd call it the most

00:03:52,950 --> 00:04:00,239
influential book I know he's just being

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,970
kind but he's not wrong and the funny

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,100
thing is that was really somewhat

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,230
beginner's luck I mean we didn't say

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,440
tango we're going to write the most

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,989
influential book of a generation now we

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,750
were writing a white paper for our

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,269
clients at the time because it seemed

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,680
what would happen is you'd go into a new

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,710
assignment you know you'd meet with the

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,450
client and my god the fact that they

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,120
ever got anything out the door was

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,669
nothing short of a miracle right

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,260
just disaster pun disaster and they're

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,919
like yeah well you know we're trying

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,510
okay so it's fine you know the first one

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,580
or two or three or five and then you

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,760
realize everyone you meet they're doing

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,860
the same things wrong it's like okay

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,530
well we can help with this you know how

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,940
about think about it this way don't do

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,389
it that way do it this way think about

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,880
this mister context so we thought it

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,550
might save some time to write down these

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,080
little observations these little stories

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,330
that we had these little anecdotes and

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,039
just write it up as a white paper we'd

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,510
ship it on ahead to our clients before

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:09,300
we got there just to save some time and

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,870
unlike every software project ever that

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,300
project grew in scope beyond what we had

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,550
had sort of thought and we were like you

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,620
know this this actually this this could

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,930
be a book we've got enough stuff here

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,330
maybe this is a book and someone

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,400
suggested and I've honestly forgotten in

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,860
the mists of time now who it was but

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,530
somebody suggested that well find a

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,470
publisher go to your bookcase see who

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,880
has the books that you most respect and

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,830
enjoy and contact them okay so we wrote

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,810
addison-wesley at the time because they

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,010
had you know the Gang of Four patterns

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,169
book and all that you know all the

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,039
classics the you know the Kay NRC all

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:54,810
the stuff and so we wrote and they said

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,490
yeah sounds good sign here okay we dude

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,110
we know nothing about writing we've

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,960
never written a book before I have no

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,630
idea what we're doing but we figured it

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,180
out the very first draft of the book

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:12,389
were written in tear off there's some

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,220
crickets back there we ran up the

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:20,160
limitations of that and then moved it

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,440
into la tech spoutin latex and and and

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,110
it that way and so through the course of

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,470
this right being programmers with a

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,370
touch of not invented here syndrome just

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,860
a wee bit most books were published then

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,840
and still today they go through this

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,729
sort of workflow where as an author you

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,960
write the manuscript in something like

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,849
well what now it would be Microsoft

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,699
or even back then you know maybe a

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:47,619
frame-maker or quark or something but

00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,059
nothing out with any kind of formatting

00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,919
or anything you just sort of write the

00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,169
text then you give it to the publisher

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,199
and they make all the figures and they

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,419
you know retype the code listings that

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,330
you printed out for them and they send

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,009
it off somewhere and type it in and just

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,439
typeset it in print it and we're looking

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,959
at this going that's stupid

00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,029
what why would you do that we you know

00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,909
we've got this nifty thing you can like

00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,800
include files in the thing that you're

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:17,529
building so we built this whole little

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,629
system that would you know produce a

00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,209
beautiful book we could run the code

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,580
examples live on the disk with unit

00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,199
tests and all the rest of that and just

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,539
suck the code right into the book with

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,439
no transcription errors so we went

00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:31,300
through and did all that they're like

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,059
okay well you know we'll typeset it for

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,389
you it's like um yeah we're we're done

00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:38,559
we're all set it we're good we got that

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,869
okay fine

00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,979
they said okay well indexing well you

00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:44,529
know publisher said we'll do the

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,779
indexing for you okay awesome so they

00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:51,279
put us in touch with a professional

00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:53,889
indexer top men I'll tell you and the

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,919
indexes first question two to us I kid

00:07:53,889 --> 00:08:05,009
you not what words do all y'all want

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:05,009
indexed so we did the indexing

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,280
and then a few other things along the

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,080
way and by the end of the process and it

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,750
was it was a handsome-looking book it

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,320
sold well to our surprise it cracked the

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:22,490
top ten on amazon.com not a programmer

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,080
books the top ten of amazon.com and it

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,150
would have been like two positions hired

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,430
but they were to Harry Potter books on

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,919
the list at the same time which I think

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,870
was extraordinarily unfair such as life

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,020
so we were we were as surprised as

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:42,440
anyone and some of that I think at the

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,600
time was really just an accident of

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,000
history it was just the right thing at

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,620
the right time and it really struck a

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,890
nerve and people are like oh this is

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,650
this is a different level of advice than

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,750
whatever they taught in university in

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,060
college you know different than I got

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,630
from these other you know professional

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:06,020
books and that was not without

00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:08,000
controversy so some of the very early

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,740
reviewers of the first draft one

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,930
gentleman in particular who's still

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,910
around it's about 150 what he's still

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:19,959
around

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:23,450
was incensed that we wrote such a fluffy

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:27,350
unscientific unsubstantiated pile of

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:29,900
drivel and how dare we miss March the

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,029
profession by daring to suggest these

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,750
things alright okay okay whatever okay

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,190
dude

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,839
you know have a nice life so it wasn't

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,400
you know it was not a slam dunk by any

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,290
means you know we were taking quite a

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,970
risk because this wasn't that the sort

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,709
of typical boring dry you've read those

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,970
textbooks right the ones where you're

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,709
halfway through reading and you just

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,350
want to kind of know your arm off to get

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,750
out of it and not not finish it

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,760
we had jokes leo there was some funny

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,430
bits in there there were some we made

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,880
fun of UML diagrams we had some stick

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,950
figures with mommy and me for use cases

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,260
you know we poked fun at things that

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,760
deserved it

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,530
and it was a good time and you know

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,670
mercifully it was it was well received

00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,630
and

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,120
it opened up a lot of people's eyes to

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,880
things that had been done but hadn't

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,000
been described well so almost this kind

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,490
of like intellectual dark matter the

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,650
kind of you know permeates between us

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,180
and if you've worked with someone

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,970
alongside someone and some kind of a

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,820
mentorship capacity and apprenticeship

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,730
the kind of deal you learn these little

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,070
tricks of the trade these ways of doing

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,340
things these these approaches but

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,220
they're not taught in undergrad courses

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,950
to this day they're not usually taught

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,060
in any formal job training it's just

00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:02,960
that stuff that's out there so Dave and

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,090
I tried very hard to put names to some

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,600
of these things and thus the dry

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:11,090
principal came about we didn't invent

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,430
that per se I mean it was an idea it was

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,710
a thing that was out there but it didn't

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,350
have a name it wasn't wasn't qualified

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,970
it wasn't quantified in any way so we

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,440
made up a definition and gave it a name

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,030
and now it is part of the vocabulary

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,430
it's you know we hear people mentioning

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:31,850
it in conference talks in TED talks in

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,890
books in courses and half the time they

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,990
don't even know where it came from

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,870
it's like okay well that was us that was

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,420
it my son just just graduated this last

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,290
semester from NC State just down the

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,420
road in computer science and he called

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,110
me up all excited one afternoon because

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,750
in there once some freshman class there

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,070
I was up on the screen alright yeah

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,550
that's got to be kind of cool it's like

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,050
hey I know that guy

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,900
so yeah I that you know I guess that

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:07,460
counts is you know Wow okay that that

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,090
got you some some fight reality so where

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,290
was I going with this

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,770
oh yeah so all these all these little

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,260
bits and pieces we sort of put names to

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,630
the idea that if you explain your code

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,220
to somebody they just sit there and nod

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,130
and as you describe it you're like oh

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,320
crap I realize what I did rubber duck

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,380
and you describe it to the duck that

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,230
came from the book and on and on and on

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,740
the ideas of tracer bullets and well I

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,180
mean it's all

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,130
the book if you've read it you've seen

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,180
them all and if not you're gonna read it

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,290
soon because you're gonna get a copy

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:41,570
tonight so so then you'll know and so 20

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,880
years came by it's like all right what

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:47,300
what do we need to change what do we

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,490
need to update given that this is not

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,750
the world of the late 90s with dial-up

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,580
modems and AOL and you know Lycos and

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,810
all the rest of these things it was a

00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:02,870
very different world so we had to add

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,720
new material you know we kind of called

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,270
out the need for DevOps back then of

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,070
course it wasn't called that so we had

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,080
to revise some of that we had you know

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,899
strongly advise you had to have a build

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,399
machine except back then it was a PC

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,720
sitting in the corner now it's a

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,300
pipeline in the cloud

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,140
same idea different implementation

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,020
that's fine

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,160
but that does that little change even

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,830
something as simple as that

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,440
that opens up a whole new world of

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,050
possibilities of other things you can do

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,850
that are interesting and so there was a

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,959
fair bit of that that okay well we have

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,910
we have matured as an industry doesn't

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,410
feel it a lot of the times but we have

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,470
we have gained some ground we have

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,959
learned how to do some things better you

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,440
know I remember back in probably the

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,180
early aughts I was in a large conference

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,310
room maybe a thousand people or so and

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,990
we asked for show of hands of who did

00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:03,079
not use version control of any sort and

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,420
a bunch of folks in the back granted

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,420
they were in the back kind of sheepishly

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,630
raised their hands I did have someone

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,800
tell me once with a straight face I said

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,680
what are you all using for version

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:21,589
control I said Microsoft Outlook I'm

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:26,510
sorry I said version control yeah we use

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:28,100
outlook how oh the end of the day we all

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:33,589
mail each other all the source codes so

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,950
there's a copy on the server I cannot

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,050
make this stuff up it's you know that's

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,420
right up there with my current favorite

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,790
worry and again I'm not making this up I

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,480
had someone tell me to my face of course

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:52,850
our organism

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:55,910
agile we use JIRA so we have a ways to

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,089
go still clearly but we have made some

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,339
progress we had to add material to the

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:04,070
book for things that weren't really a

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:06,949
consideration back in the day you know

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:10,160
back at some wonderful point in time you

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:12,079
could VI main dot see and run a dot out

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
and you know everything was just right

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,269
there and it was beautiful and now you

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,579
can't do that right hello world and

00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:24,050
react brings in what is it a thousand

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:27,970
ten thousand NPM modules I'm sorry

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,970
remote viruses from all over the web

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,519
yeah that's that's yeah that's gonna

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:36,139
come back to bite us well and you met

00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,180
what left pad right you remember the

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,839
left pad disaster about what was that

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:45,260
two years ago ish where the the

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,329
maintainer pulled a simple five line

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,680
module and half the web broke because

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:50,540
everyone was building with live

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,760
dependencies and suddenly this thing and

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,040
the repo wasn't there anymore and the

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,860
whole thing croaked this is why we can't

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,720
have nice things

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,769
so we had so we had added that's a long

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,350
way of saying we had to add a little

00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:06,139
chapter on just thinking about basic

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,029
security because that really wasn't a

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,319
consideration back in the day and now

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,800
that has to be almost one of the first

00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,569
considerations security privacy how can

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,459
this be weaponized could this thing

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,699
you're writing be used against people

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:22,790
could it be used against you that wasn't

00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,769
a concern not that long ago and now it's

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,850
maybe the chief concern you know what

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,079
are we doing with this data

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,139
there's personally identifiable

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,730
information there's laws about that you

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,339
know if gdpr hasn't bit you yet

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,970
California just did and they won't be

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,199
the last

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,310
right that's missed the tip of the

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:43,250
iceberg so you know those kinds of

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,860
societal impacts are moving in and as

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,660
Todd said in the beginning software is

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,370
everywhere it's not like software is

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,089
going to eat the world that's that's

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:58,280
that ship sailed it's done you know yeah

00:16:53,089 --> 00:17:00,920
hey a wonderful Twitter account that

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,660
I this is being taped and shown so I

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,600
can't say the actual name of the account

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,810
because it contains profanity but it

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,270
talks about the internet of things and

00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,860
you know points out these hilarious bits

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,140
where you know you can't go you know

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,850
this guy had to like put a t-shirt over

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,100
his lamp because he couldn't turn the

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:23,360
lamp off because the lamp server was

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,819
down you know and these these kinds of

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,319
things you know the oven that

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,410
spontaneously turned itself on and

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,690
burned the house down and you know all

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,270
this great stuff and we're right in

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,700
there that's that's us we are right in

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,460
there with that so you know what may

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,920
have just been a core dump or a crash or

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,070
a blue screen of death that starts

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,500
getting a lot more of the death part and

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,170
that's on us we have to be a little bit

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,620
more conscious about these things so we

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,970
tried to pack all these changes to the

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,910
world all these new things that are

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,920
happening today but still keep the

00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,480
flavor of the original pragmatic

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,070
programmer book still keep as many of

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,570
the jokes as we could get away with and

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,710
some of them we couldn't some of them

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,460
were kind of stupid the first time

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,990
around to be honest so we ditched those

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,600
the fun the interesting thing was when

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,390
Dave and I first wrote the book it took

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,470
a little over maybe two main years of

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,740
effort we stopped taking clients and we

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,660
focused exclusively on writing for over

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:31,310
a solid year it was probably like 14

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:35,630
months and we would literally argue over

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:38,350
exact words so first of all Dave's from

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:42,680
England he's British so he talks funny

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,750
and what's worse is he lives in Texas so

00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,250
y'all really talked funny with a British

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,210
accent so there were some very hilarious

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,950
misunderstandings where he would use the

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,550
the British form of expression and I'm

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,520
like what the hell are you talking about

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,220
didn't did not translate but we were

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,790
very careful and very precise where we

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,400
could be to try to get the right idea

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,110
across because it's so easy to just

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,050
mistakenly use the wrong word and

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,180
somebody misunderstands especial

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,060
you're talking about code you talk about

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:20,480
some variable that's that's called X no

00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,700
no it's named X you use the word called

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,560
now you're executing it and people start

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,810
getting it right so these very simple

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,940
things but suddenly it can get quite

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,190
confusing if you're if you're sloppy

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,700
about it so we were very very careful

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,680
and spend an inordinate of time really

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,470
crafting and distilling and honing the

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,750
book trying to get it to what we thought

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,420
at the time were sort of the most

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,730
important things that weren't being

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,640
discussed that weren't powered in the

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,980
open that weren't widely known and

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,530
apparently that that worked and that

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,080
paid off so this time came around to

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,220
redo it for the 20th anniversary we're

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,100
like oh boy

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,990
we're gonna have wildly different ideas

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,270
about what needs to change I'm you know

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,280
how are we going to do this so each went

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,500
off and separately made a list of all

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,510
right here the biggest things that I

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,530
think have changed in the industry here

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,420
are the things I think we need to

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,190
address here's the tips I think we need

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,380
to ditch because they're not relevant

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,640
anymore or you know we've changed our

00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,130
position on it or whatever it might be

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,260
and Dave made the same list for himself

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,110
and then we went and checked them

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,630
against each other and 80% of the list

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,900
was identical in the same order even

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,960
it's like get that camera on me or

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,340
something but and that I took that is a

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,560
really good sign because that meant that

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,800
you know despite our differences of

00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,780
opinions and and different experiences

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,250
that was pretty common you know we

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,140
recognized all right these are these are

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,380
the important things so that's what we

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,870
focused on and the results you know it's

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,680
it's it sounds self-serving because it

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,960
is but it really is a fun read

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,420
you know I enjoyed going back even you

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,660
know proofreading it for the brazillian

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,700
of time I'd you can never proofread it

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,860
enough right you can you can look at

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,140
something a hundred times in a row and

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,230
as soon as it the ink hits paper you

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,190
find the to buzz in the row or whatever

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:22,100
it might be but we did that we started

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,430
working on that last spring we delivered

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,670
it to the printer july 1st i think it

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,770
was

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:32,390
and funny thing our publishing company

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:36,710
pragmatic bookshelf on the web at Prague

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:41,840
Prague calm our authors when they finish

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:45,200
writing it takes 8 to 10 weeks of copy

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,450
edit and layout and indexing and then

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,820
proofing it and these sorts of processes

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:53,000
and then bang it's it's finished and

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,060
it's ready for production and the print

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,160
takes days we have it up in eBook that

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,830
same day so it's it's moderately fast

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,710
process my wife wrote a textbook on

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,620
nursing informatics when she delivered

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:11,510
the manuscript to Springer it was 12

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:14,000
months before they had it in print when

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:17,780
we delivered our manuscript in July we

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,700
got hardcovers in September end to end

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,960
of September and to September early

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,850
October so you know we have claims that

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,340
we have an agile publishing company and

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,560
if you actually look at stats like that

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,120
actually look at numbers we really do we

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,630
move stuff right along we get it out

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,420
it's smooth that's streamlined other

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,670
older more established companies not so

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,240
much they've got a lot more process in

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,770
place a lot more bureaucracy different

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,800
market forces maybe different

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,660
considerations but you know with

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,050
something like a tech book right you

00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,660
can't let it sit around for a year right

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,910
the world is moved by then you're on

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,930
Rails 8 by now yeah or whatever it might

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,030
be so that's kind of the short history

00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:08,500
of the book and how it came about and

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,500
