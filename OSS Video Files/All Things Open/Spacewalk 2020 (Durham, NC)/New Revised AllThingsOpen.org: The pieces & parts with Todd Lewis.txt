00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,910
so I'll show you this really really

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,310
quickly and then we will move very very

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,350
fast so even on this new website and

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,449
again we're this is in progress we're

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,850
working on this as we speak our team is

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,650
for sure but these are 3d animations you

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,369
can put your cursor over them you can

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,810
interact with them and we use a lot of

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,399
open-source technology on this we use

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,880
three Jas

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,850
we use green sock animation platform we

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,500
use view for some of the scaffolding etc

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,750
so we use a lot of open-source Tekken

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,280
this stuff and in the coming days in the

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,410
coming weeks we'll release a lot of the

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,940
code and we'll also release some blog

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,800
post and will tell you exactly how we

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,629
did it and then we'll engage with you if

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,039
you're interested as to how you might be

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,989
able to do some of this yourself as well

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,149
so we think it's kind of neat again we

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,129
like to keep it fun and interactive and

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,440
I don't know playful is an overused term

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,899
but again technologies should be fun it

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,780
shouldn't be all you know frowns and and

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,850
and rainy days so anyway you can kind of

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,409
see a lot of what we do and again you

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,330
can come to the site interact this all

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,100
will change and in the future you can

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,750
get news will begin to release news

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,850
about what we're doing through all

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,890
things open again which is now more of a

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,570
universe type site encompassing

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,770
everything that we do and you can see

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,820
some of the things that we've already

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,350
posted are really a blog post describing

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,020
what we're doing in person here tonight

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,049
but also what we do seven steps that we

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,970
take try to try to ensure diversity

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,340
inclusion at our events just seven

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,740
things but will begin to go into more

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,869
depth about what we do a lot of people

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,790
ask us and I'll be the first to admit up

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,530
to this point we've been it hasn't been

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,180
intentionally secretive or anything like

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,130
that but it's just we've been so busy we

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,420
have such a small team we haven't

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,979
released a lot of this stuff so we're

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,079
going to begin talking about more of

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,729
this stuff publicly moving forward so

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,590
that is the site and where you can sort

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,240
of find that so that's again the new

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,479
site moving forward so please be aware

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,350
of that and if you don't mind please

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,429
spread the word because you know someone

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,050
coming to the site for the first time

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,520
expecting only to hear about the

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,190
conference and things like that

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,700

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,650
surprise so you saw again all things
