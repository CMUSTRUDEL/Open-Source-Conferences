00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,009
in some look folks those of you that

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,980
have known me and known our team for a

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,050
long time you know this we exist to

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,730
create opportunity everything that we've

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,140
done for the last eight years under the

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,369
ATO banner honestly has been testing a

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:32,510
hypothesis in a theory can we do better

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,390
ourselves can we survive and pay bills

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:38,070
while helping other people you a

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,590
surprising number of people do not

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,469
believe that surprising number of people

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,690
think look go for it help yourself first

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,239
you can't take care of anyone else until

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,559
you help yourself first to a degree

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,420
that's true there's a lot of truth in to

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,489
that but we've again this has been an

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,739
eight-year test of the belief that no no

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,149
those two things can work together so

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,989
that's what we've always been about and

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,620
that's what we'll be about moving

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,620
