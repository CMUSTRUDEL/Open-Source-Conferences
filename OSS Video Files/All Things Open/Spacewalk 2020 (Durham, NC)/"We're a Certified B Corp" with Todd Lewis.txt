00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,530
we are a certified B Corp for those of

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,080
you that did not know that we achieved

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,480
that certification in 2018 almost two

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,730
years ago it took a long time to achieve

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,100
the certification took us about a year

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,080
to a year and a half of effort we did

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,279
not know and we're not aware of some of

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,930
the data that would be required on the

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,580
front end that we would have to present

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,500
and have verified in order to achieve

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,090
the certification so because we weren't

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,950
collecting the right data to begin with

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,290
we had to go back through another cycle

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,450
of events in another year of what we do

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,730
and gather the data and then present it

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,649
for verification etc if anyone here

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,750
wants to learn more about getting us to

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,489
becoming a certified B Corp if he would

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,410
find me I'd be happy to give you some

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,180
information make some connections for

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,100
you there's actually a local B Corp

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,870
organization meetup I believe that meets

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,399
here in the Triangle so maybe we can

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,250
make a connection for you as well it's a

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,750
good thing all it says is that you know

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,789
you believe that there's maybe a better

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,680
way of doing business

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,510
then simply focusing on the bottom line

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,460
nothing wrong with focusing on the

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,409
bottom line everyone has to eat everyone

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,400
has bills to pay that's part of life

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,830
that's normal

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,299
however there is a better way and you

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,070
know by focusing on maybe a few other

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,320
things as well as you are attempting to

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,790
make a living and deliver a value that

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,030
someone is willing to exchange currency

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,030
