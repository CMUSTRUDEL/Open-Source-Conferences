[Music]

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,109
next question

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,870
boy Todd goes right to the hard one okay

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,760
well so for the 40th anniversary edition

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,590
I said you're just gonna you know plug

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,620
the fiber-optic Jack right into the side

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,730
and have the AI write it for me yeah I

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,010
would actually have to go back and see

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,309
what the what we thought the biggest

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,500
change was I think it was probably a a

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,740
kind of a confluence of several things

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,320
of items that we had to fight really

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,410
hard for back in the day to get adopted

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,869
like unit testing right that was a hard

00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,580
sell people did not want to do it some

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,840
people still don't but at least they

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,580
know what you're talking about now

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,789
at least they feel guilty about not

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,070
doing it so that's that's progress

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,840
that's progress

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,280
but a lot of that stuff has become far

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,570
more accepted you know you said pair

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,210
programming before and they're like

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,250
Tommy we're not doing that you know what

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,259
they'd have some kind of reaction and

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,450
now that you know they've got mob

00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,890
programming which is you know even that

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,960
but but even greater and they're

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,240
reporting good good success with that so

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,729
okay yeah we've made some progress there

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,700
the whole idea of having your build

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:53,000
pipeline and your repo hosted in the

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,189
cloud that's pretty brilliant and

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,200
empowering you know not having to

00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,180
maintain that server over in the corner

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,070
and there that I don't know if this is

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,290
in one of the editions of the book where

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,780
I've just told it forever but there was

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,929
this developer I knew lucky Pierre those

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,329
really his name he decided that this

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,070
particular search algorithm wasn't

00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:15,380
running fast enough on this piece of

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,620
hardware this was running os/2 back in

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:22,130
the day so he went in and rewrote the

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:27,019
process scheduler in the kernel on os/2

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:29,750
to tweak it okay bold move but all right

00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:31,190
well and it worked great and you know

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,540
they got the performance increase that

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,459
they wanted and that was wonderful

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:41,410
tiny problem it never worked anywhere

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:44,180
else in the world other than his machine

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,250
literally so I'm thinking this was some

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,890
kind of like cosmic ray quantum effect

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,740
kind of something because they got the

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,810
same gear from the same

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,690
loaded the same software stack on it

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,700
faced it in the same direction you know

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,830
what nothing

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,940
it was the the most extreme case of

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,160
works on my machine and didn't and that

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,460
is you know you laugh right but that's

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,120
docker right docker is

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,760
institutionalizing it works on my

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,830
machine ship the my machine so those

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,910
were probably the the biggest changes

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:25,000
the biggest change is going forward my

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,320
crystal balls in the shop but it is a

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,590
hard one because you know a lot of folks

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,440
are like oh eh ai ai ai No

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,410
first of all it's not AI okay if you're

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,020
talking to VC venture capitalists it's

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,240
AI if you're trying to recruit people

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,970
for the team recruiting talent right

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,890
it's machine learning you're sitting

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,890
there doing it it's linear regression

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,590
it's all of this anyone who's worried

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,360
and and this is you know this is

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,880
something that gets some ink it says Oh

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,140
AI is gonna take our jobs and steal our

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:07,060
future you ever use the self-checkout at

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,410
the grocery store I don't think I don't

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,210
we don't have much to worry about yet I

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,280
think we're I think we're okay there so

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:19,270
I don't think you know if we get some

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,770
assists via machine learning and related

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:24,400
technologies you know something that

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,680
will help us as we're coding great you

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,230
know love it it's it's like autocomplete

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,200
on steroids okay dynamite it's not gonna

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,230
write code for us I would like to see us

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,440
continue to sort of move up in the world

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,560
and deal less with lower and lower level

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,200
concerns one of the first computers I

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,970
ever bought the salesman at the store

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,130
cracked open the floppy drive the 8 inch

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,290
floppy drive and checked it out on an

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,940
oscilloscope before sending it home with

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,850
way to make sure the heads were aligned

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,370
and everything that was the tech at the

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,250
day things have changed a little bit

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,080
we've moved up levels of abstraction

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,540
from that

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,520
all right a little bit and we've got

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,199
kind of the precarious stack now because

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,720
right the you know the ten thousand NPM

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,600
modules and all the rest of that and

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,310
that's kind of curious I don't I not

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,190
sure how that's gonna play out because

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,680
that seems to me that that's running up

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,050
against the you know security and and

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,820
verifiability kind of concerns and

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,790
they're really at loggerheads there

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,070
because now we expect this level of

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,320
support that oh there's there's a gem

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,720
for that there's a there's a module for

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,460
that I can just grab this set of

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,760
features and shove it into my project

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,770
without knowing what it really is mmm

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,479
usually in sci-fi movies that doesn't

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,410
work out real well so we'll see it'll be

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,410
