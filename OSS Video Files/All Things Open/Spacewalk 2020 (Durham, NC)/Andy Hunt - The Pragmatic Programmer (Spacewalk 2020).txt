00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,049
folks I asked before how many people

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,270
here have read pragmatic programmer

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,529
owned a copy have been influenced by the

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,990
book large number of you said yes a

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,519
number of you said no so I think this is

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,920
a good opportunity for those that have

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,630
been influenced and are familiar it kind

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,070
of maybe gets the backstory maybe have

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,440
some of the gaps filled in here from

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,510
Andy directly and then also for those of

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
you not familiar you'll understand why

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,890
we feel like it's the most influential

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,140
book maybe in the history of Technology

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,579
when it comes to programmers and by the

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,620
way I would say this if Andy weren't

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,750
standing right here I would a hundred

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,550
percent say that and that's merely based

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,829
on feedback from our community over a

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,570
lot a lot of years so Andy you did a

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,890
great job with the book thank you very

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,449
much for being here tonight thanks for

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,190
agreeing to sign books and speak to

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,170
people afterwards and for those of you

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,699
by all means I want you to stick around

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,949
we're gonna do about forty forty-five

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,600
minutes of talk and then QA and then

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,040
we'll wrap things up and then we'll go

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,580
right outside we'll have books sitting

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,590
out 50 of them will be available hard

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,119
hardcover so they're very very nice but

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,159
they'll be available on a first-come

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,320
first-served basis as well Andy thank

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,210
you very very much my friend thanks you

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,319

[Applause]

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,869
he started it but I'm that's a hot mic

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,880
he started it but I'm gonna say thanks

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:36,159
for coming out I took one look at the

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,140
temperature was gonna let my dog out the

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,320
dogs like I'm wait until about March

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,580
we're not doing this so yeah I wouldn't

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,179
have come tonight if I didn't have you

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,450
know sort of have to so thanks my name

00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:54,780
is Andy hunt I have been programming

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:56,950
commercially for money for 38 years

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,409
I shouldn't say that anymore that that

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,909
sounds kind of horrible and one of these

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,520
days I'm gonna figure out how it

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:06,819
actually worked and and how to do it

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,239
right I'm still working on that so back

00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,709
in the mid 90s towards the end of the

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,420
90s Dave Thomas and I wrote the

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,640
pragmatic programmer book which I'll

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,239
tell you about in a second and then in

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,709
the early 2000s like mm mmm

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,780
I guess it was 2000 we wrote the pickaxe

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,850
the Ruby programming book which sort of

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,880
introduced Ruby to the to the rest of

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,829
the world and then this little thing

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,489
happened where as one of the authors of

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:39,760
the agile manifesto trying to to get

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,370
people to think beyond the sort of rigid

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,530
linear bureaucratic plan based

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,500
approaches and do something more

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,570
effective a little while after that Dave

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,819
and I founded the pragmatic bookshelf

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,400
publishing company which is my

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,100
quote-unquote day job these days

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,739
I run the publishing company which is an

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,620
interesting experience to sort of be at

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:04,930
the whatever metaphor you want to use to

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,200
be at the crossroads to have your finger

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,269
on the pulse of what people are excited

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,450
about what people are interested in what

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,670
people think are important enough to

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,730
devote nine to twelve months of their

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:22,209
life writing a book about that's some

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,769
serious commitment and you really only

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,660
want to undertake something like that if

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,170
you are really really passionate about

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,840
the subject matter so that's an

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,000
interesting data point to kind of see

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,910
what's going on in the world and there's

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,940
a lot going on in the world

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:43,360
especially these days as they say so as

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,310
Dave and I set out to do a 20th

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,730
anniversary edition of the pragmatic

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,240
programmer book it was a bit of a time

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,030
capsule to go back and see well what was

00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:00,160
the development world like back in the

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,520
late 90s versus today and an awful lot

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,900
has changed right so think back to those

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,910
days you know say 98 97 98 or so

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,730
dinosaurs roamed the earth right grazing

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,820
under the window peacefully and the

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,459
dinosaurs were named Lycos AltaVista

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,590
right those were the search engine

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,700
Giants everyone was really worried about

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,770
this huge monopoly called AOL that was

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,800
oh it was horrible they carpet-bombed

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,540
you with it with CDs it was it was

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,370
devastating and you know it's a

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,690
different Google what Google was not a

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,220
verb you know that wasn't a thing it was

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,320
a very different world but a lot of

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,870
things as we notice going through the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,960
book a lot of things haven't changed

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:53,980
anything to deal with us as people as

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,070
individuals as programmers developers we

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,780
haven't changed in tens of thousands of

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,750
years hundreds of thousands of years the

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,400
tech has changed but you know it always

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,620
does so back in the 90s what happened

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,800
was we did not set out to write a book

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,040
at all let alone a but what did Todd

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,740
call it the most influential book I know

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,940
he's just being kind but he's not wrong

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,250
and the funny thing is that was really

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,350
somewhat beginner's luck I mean we

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,090
didn't say tango we're going to write

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,850
the most influential book of a

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,610
generation now we were writing a white

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,280
paper for our clients at the time

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,590
because it seemed what would happen is

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,530
you'd go into a new assignment you know

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,270
you'd meet with the client and my god

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,360
the fact that they ever got anything out

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,060
the door was nothing short of a miracle

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,060
right just disaster pun disaster and

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,600
they're like yeah well

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,580
you know we're trying ok so it's finding

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,560
of the first one or two or three or five

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,710
and then you realize everyone you meet

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,140
they're doing the same things wrong it's

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,300
like okay well we can help with this you

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,070
know how about think about it this way

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,580
don't do it that way do it this way

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,920
think about this mister context so we

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,350
thought it might save some time to write

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,790
down these little observations these

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,070
little stories that we had these little

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,930
anecdotes and just write it up as a

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,420
white paper we'd ship it on ahead to our

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,500
clients before we got there just to save

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:30,800
some time and unlike every software

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,500
project ever that project grew in scope

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,870
beyond what we had had sort of thought

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,060
and we're like you know this this

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,740
actually this this could be a book we've

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,260
got enough stuff here maybe this is a

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,360
book and someone suggested and I've

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,730
honestly forgotten in the mists of time

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,730
now who it was but somebody suggested

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,670
that well find a publisher go to your

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:56,140
bookcase see who has the books that you

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:59,660
most respect and enjoy and contact them

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,580
okay so we wrote addison-wesley at the

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,170
time because they had you know the Gang

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,520
of Four patterns book and all that you

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,110
know all the classics that you know the

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:12,670
knr see all the stuff and so we wrote

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,680
and they said yeah sounds good sign here

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,390
okay we do we know nothing about writing

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,390
we've never written a book before I have

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:23,180
no idea what we're doing but we figured

00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:28,700
it out the very first drafts of the book

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:31,880
were written in tear off there's some

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,740
crickets back there we ran up the

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:39,680
limitations of that and then moved it

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,960
into la tech spoutin latex and and and

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,630
it that way and so through the course of

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,600
this right being programmers with a

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:51,890
touch of not invented here syndrome just

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,380
a wee bit most books were published then

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,360
and still today they go through this

00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,280
sort of workflow where as an author you

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,530
write the manuscript in something like

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,030
well what now would be Microsoft Word or

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,090
even back then you know maybe

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,470
maker quark or something but nothing out

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,420
with any kind of formatting or anything

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,040
you just sort of write the text then you

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,340
give it to the publisher and they make

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,410
all the figures and they you know retype

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,390
the code listings that you printed out

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,510
for them and they send it off somewhere

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,270
and type it in and just typeset it in

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,960
print it and we're looking at this going

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,480
that's stupid

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
what why would you do that we you know

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,400
we've got this nifty thing you can like

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,410
include files in the thing that you're

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,050
building so we built this whole little

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,150
system that would you know produce a

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,730
beautiful book we could run the code

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,040
examples live on the disk with unit

00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,720
tests and all the rest of that and just

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,060
suck the code right into the book with

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,870
no transcription errors so we went

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
through and did all that and they're

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,400
like okay well you know we'll typeset it

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,580
for you it's like um yeah we're we're

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,100
done we're all set it we're good we got

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,080
that okay fine so they said okay well

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,850
indexing well you know publisher said

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,890
we'll do the indexing for you okay

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,760
awesome so they put us in touch with a

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:12,600
professional indexer top men I'll tell

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,230
you and the indexes first question to to

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:25,470
us I kid you not what words do all y'all

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:27,450
want indexed so we did the indexing and

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,860
and if you know few other things along

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,180
the way and and by the end of the

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,850
process and it was it was a

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,130
handsome-looking book it sold well to

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,700
our surprise it cracked the top ten on

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,270
amazon.com not a programmer books the

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,040
top ten of amazon.com and it would have

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,930
been like two positions hired but there

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,390
were two Harry Potter books on the list

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:53,430
at the same time which I think was

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:55,650
extraordinarily unfair such as life so

00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:00,080
we were we were as surprised as anyone

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:02,580
and some of that I think at the time was

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,680
really just an accident of history it

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,990
was just the right thing at the right

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,960
time and it really struck a nerve and

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,090
people are like oh this is this is a

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,300
different level of advice than whatever

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,480
they taught in university in college you

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,899
know different than I got

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,730
from these other professional books and

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,620
that was not without controversy so some

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,019
of the very early reviewers of the first

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,269
draft one gentleman in particular who's

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:36,579
still around it's about 150 what he's

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:40,889
still around was incensed that we wrote

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:43,870
such a fluffy unscientific

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:48,100
unsubstantiated pile of drivel and how

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:51,190
dare we miss March the profession by

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,600
daring to suggest these things alright

00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:00,130
okay okay whatever okay dude you know

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,750
have a nice life so it wasn't you know

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,579
it was not a slam dunk by any means you

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,940
know we were taking quite a risk because

00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:10,060
this wasn't that the sort of typical

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,589
boring dry you've read those textbooks

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,699
right the ones where you're halfway

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,529
through reading and you just want to

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:17,980
kind of know your arm off to get out of

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,990
it and not not finish it we had jokes

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,569
leo there was some funny bits in there

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,490
there were some we made fun of UML

00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:28,240
diagrams we had some stick figures with

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,779
mommy and me for use cases you know we

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,250
poked fun at things that deserved it and

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,260
it was a good time and you know

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,589
mercifully it was it was well-received

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,639
and it opened up a lot of people's eyes

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:45,459
to things that had been done but hadn't

00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,550
been described well so almost this kind

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,010
of like intellectual dark matter that

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,050
kind of you know permeates between us

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,699
and if you've worked with someone

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,490
alongside someone and some kind of a

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:00,339
mentorship capacity and apprenticeship

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,250
the kind of deal you learn these little

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:05,620
tricks of the trade these ways of doing

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,860
things these these approaches but

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,709
they're not taught in undergrad courses

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,470
to this day they're not usually taught

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:18,730
in any formal job training it's just

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:22,480
that stuff that's out there so Dave and

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,610
I tried very hard to put names to some

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,120
of these things and thus the dry

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,320
principal came about we didn't invent

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,690
that per se I mean it was an eye

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,250
it was a thing that was out there but it

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,000
didn't have a name it wasn't wasn't

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,850
qualified

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,500
it wasn't quantified in any way so we

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,940
made up a definition and gave it a name

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,530
and now it is part of the vocabulary

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,960
it's you know we hear people mentioning

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,380
it in conference talks in TED talks in

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,420
books in courses and half the time they

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,490
don't even know where it came from

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,370
it's like okay well that was us that was

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,920
it my son just just graduated this last

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,790
semester from NC State just down the

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,920
road in computer science and he called

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,610
me up all excited one afternoon because

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,280
in there once some freshman class there

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,570
I was up on the screen alright yeah

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,220
that's got to be kind of cool it's like

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:20,990
hey I know that guy so yeah I that you

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,570
know I guess that counts is you know Wow

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,680
okay that that got you some some

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,790
vitality so where was I going with this

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,270
oh yeah so all these all these little

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,760
bits and pieces we sort of put names to

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,160
the idea that if you explain your code

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,740
to somebody they just sit there and nod

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,810
and as you describe it you're like oh

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,510
crap I realize what I did rubberducky

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,060
you describe it to the doc that came

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,000
from the book and on and on and on the

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,350
idea of tracer bullets and well I mean

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,150
it's all in the book if you've read it

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,260
you've seen them all and if not you're

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,570
gonna read it soon because you're gonna

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,690
get a copy tonight so so then you'll

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,630
know and so 20 years came by it's like

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,690
all right what what do we need to change

00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:08,330
what do we need to update given that

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,320
this is not the world of the late 90s

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,540
with dial-up modems and AOL and you know

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,780
Lycos and all the rest of these things

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:22,010
it was a very different world so we had

00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:25,040
to add new material you know we kind of

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,680
called out the need for DevOps back then

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,450
of course it wasn't called that so we

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,130
had to revise some of that we had you

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,890
know strongly advise you've had to have

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,900
a build machine except back then it was

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,250
a PC sitting in the corner now it's a

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,800
pipeline in the cloud

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,710
same idea different implementation

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,550
that's fine but that does that little

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,740
change

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,320
something as simple as that that opens

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,660
up a whole new world of possibilities of

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,060
other things you can do that are

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,610
interesting and so there was a fair bit

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,910
of that that okay well we have we have

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,890
matured as an industry doesn't feel it a

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,269
lot of the times but we have we have

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,149
gained some ground we have learned how

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,820
to do some things better you know I

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,000
remember back in probably the early

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,740
aughts I was in a large conference room

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,050
maybe a thousand people or so and we

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,490
asked for show of hands of who did not

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:22,700
use version control of any sort and a

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,920
bunch of folks in the back granted they

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,920
were in the back kind of sheepishly

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,160
raised their hands I did have someone

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,300
tell me once with a straight face I said

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,180
what are you all using for version

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:41,089
control I said Microsoft Outlook I'm

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:46,040
sorry I said version control yeah we use

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:47,600
outlook how oh the end of the day we all

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,089
mail each other all the source codes so

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:56,480
there's a copy on the server I cannot

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,579
make this stuff up it's you know that's

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,770
right up there with my current favorite

00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,660
word and I again I'm not making this up

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,910
I had someone tell me to my face

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:12,800
of course our organization is agile we

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:15,730
use JIRA so we have a ways to go still

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,220
clearly but we have made some progress

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,839
we had to add material to the book for

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,660
things that weren't really a

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,449
consideration back in the day you know

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,660
back at some wonderful point in time you

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:31,430
could VI main dot C and run a dot out

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,010
and you know everything was just right

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,740
there and it was beautiful and now you

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,110
can't do that right hello world and

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,430
react brings in what is it a thousand

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:47,529
ten thousand NPM modules I'm sorry

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,529
remote viruses from all over the web

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,040
yeah that's that's yeah that's gonna

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,660
come back to bite us well and you met

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,700
what left pad right you remember the

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,330
left pad disaster about what was that

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,780
two years ago ish where the the

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,850
maintainer pulled a simple five line

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,200
module and half the web broke because

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,060
everyone was building with live

00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,280
dependencies and suddenly this thing and

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,530
the repo wasn't there anymore and the

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,280
whole thing croaked this is why we can't

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,780
have nice things so we had to so we had

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,120
added that's a long way of saying we had

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,090
to add a little chapter on just thinking

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,100
about basic security because that really

00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,660
wasn't a consideration back in the day

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,210
and now that has to be almost one of the

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,000
first considerations security privacy

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,890
how can this be weaponized could this

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,190
thing you're writing be used against

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,010
people could it be used against you that

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,020
wasn't a concern not that long ago and

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,370
now it's maybe the chief concern you

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,600
know what are we doing with this data

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,240
there's personally identifiable

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,250
information there's laws about that

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,770
you know if gdpr hasn't bit you yet

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,550
California just did and there won't be

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,170
the last

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,830
right that's miss the tip of the iceberg

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:03,460
so you know those kinds of societal

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,130
impacts are moving in and as Todd said

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,750
in the beginning software is everywhere

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,850
it's not like software is going to eat

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,890
the world that's that's that ship sailed

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,910
it's done you know yeah hey a wonderful

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:21,070
Twitter account that I this is being

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,020
taped and shown so I can't say the

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,450
actual name of the account because it

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,450
contains profanity but it talks about

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:31,060
the internet of things and you know

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,920
points out these hilarious bits where

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,140
you know you can't go you know this guy

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,790
had to like put a t-shirt over his lamp

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,990
because he couldn't turn the lamp off

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:44,650
because the lamp server was down you

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,330
know and these these kinds of things you

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,420
know the oven that spontaneously turned

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,790
itself on and burned the house down and

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,490
you know all this great stuff and we're

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,800
right in there that's that's off we are

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,200
right in there with that so you know

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,340
what may have just been a core dump or a

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,410
crash or a blue screen of death

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,700
that starts getting a lot more the death

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,990
part and that's on us we have to be a

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,910
little bit more conscious about these

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,840
things so we've tried to pack all these

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,870
changes to the world all these new

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,640
things that are happening today but

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,710
still keep the flavor of the original

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,030
pragmatic programmer book still keep as

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,920
many of the jokes as we could get away

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,030
with and some of them we couldn't some

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,130
of them were kind of stupid the first

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:31,280
time around to be honest so we ditched

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,680
those the fun the interesting thing was

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,740
when Dave and I first wrote the book it

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,550
took a little over maybe two main years

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,700
of effort we stopped taking clients and

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,740
we focused exclusively on writing for

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,360
over a solid year it was probably like

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:54,740
14 months and we would literally argue

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,780
over exact words so first of all Dave's

00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,440
from England he's British

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:03,170
so he talks funny and what's worse is he

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,530
lives in Texas so y'all really talk

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,670
funny with a British accent so there

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,740
were some very hilarious

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,450
misunderstandings where he would use the

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,050
the British form of expression and I'm

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,050
like what the hell are you talking about

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,750
didn't did not translate but we were

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:24,290
very careful and very precise where we

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,930
could be to try to get the right idea

00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,700
across because it's so easy to just

00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,610
mistakenly use the wrong word and

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,680
somebody misunderstands especially if

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,560
you're talking about code you talk about

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,010
some variable that's that's called X no

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,230
no it's named X you use the word called

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,090
now you're executing it and people start

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,310
getting it right so these very simple

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,500
things but suddenly it can get quite

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,930
confusing if you're if you're sloppy

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,200
about it so we were very very careful

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:56,180
and spend an inordinate of time really

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,970
crafting and distilling and honing the

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,250
book trying to get it to what we thought

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,010
at the time were sort of the most

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,260
important things that weren't being

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,900
discussed that weren't powered in the

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,540
open that weren't widely known and

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,060
apparently that that worked and that

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,049
paid off so this time came around to

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,379
redo it for the 20

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:21,080
anniversary I'm like oh boy we're gonna

00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:23,029
have wildly different ideas about what

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,720
needs to change I'm you know how are we

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,119
gonna do this

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,980
so each went off and separately made a

00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,470
list of all right here the biggest

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,759
things that I think have changed in the

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,649
industry here are the things I think we

00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,299
need to address here's the tips I think

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:37,429
we need to ditch because they're not

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,899
relevant anymore or you know we've

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,149
changed our position on it or whatever

00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:43,220
it might be and Dave made the same list

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:46,399
for himself and then we went and checked

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,980
them against each other and 80% of the

00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:52,399
list was identical in the same order

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,460
even it's like get that camera on me or

00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:56,869
something but and that I took that is a

00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,059
really good sign because that meant that

00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,129
you know despite our differences of

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:04,309
opinions and and different experiences

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,779
that was pretty common you know we

00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,669
recognized all right these are these are

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:10,879
the important things so that's what we

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:13,369
focused on and the results you know it's

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:17,869
it's it sounds self-serving because it

00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:19,549
is but it really is a fun read you know

00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,009
I enjoyed going back even you know

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:25,190
proofreading it for the brazillian of

00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:27,200
time I'd you can never proofread it

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,359
enough right you can you can look at

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,639
something a hundred times in a row and

00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,730
as soon as it the ink hits paper you

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:38,720
find the to those in the row or whatever

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,600
it might be but we did that we started

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,929
working on that last spring we delivered

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,470
it to the printer July 1st I think it

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,499
was and funny thing our publishing

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:55,609
company pragmatic bookshelf on the web

00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:59,480
at Prague Prague calm our authors when

00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:02,989
they finish writing it takes 8 to 10

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,289
weeks of copy edit and layout and

00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:08,299
indexing and then proofing it and these

00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,159
sorts of processes and then bang it's

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,539
it's finished and it's ready for

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,340
production and the print takes days we

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:19,039
have it up in eBook that same day so

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,200
it's it's a moderately fast process my

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,269
wife wrote a textbook on nursing

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,039
informatics when she delivered the

00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:30,010
manuscript to Springer it was 12 months

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,720
before they had it in

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:37,130
when we delivered our manuscript in July

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,200
we got hardcovers in September end to

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:43,490
end of September end of September early

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,380
October so you know we have claimed that

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,840
we have an agile publishing company and

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,090
if you actually look at stats like that

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,590
actually look at numbers we really do we

00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,160
move stuff right along we get it out

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:57,950
it's smooth that's streamlined other

00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,200
older more established companies not so

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,740
much they've got a lot more process in

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,300
place a lot more bureaucracy different

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,300
market forces maybe different

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,160
considerations but you know with

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,490
something like a tech book right you

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,160
can't let it sit around for a year right

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:18,290
the world is moved by then you're on

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,130
Rails eight by now yeah or whatever it

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,840
might be so that's kind of the short

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:28,000
history of the book and how it came

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,000
