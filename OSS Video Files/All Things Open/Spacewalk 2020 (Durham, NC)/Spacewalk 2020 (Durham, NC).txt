wonderful okay so to everybody watching

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,680
on the livestream we really appreciate

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,080
you being here

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,790
I've been pinged a lot offline hey can't

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,040
make it tonight but I am gonna catch you

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,150
6:30 I'm gonna tune in so thank you all

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,529
and to my son Grayson a I love you he's

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,390
supposed to be watching I hope his mom

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,100
has him in front of a computer or at

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,580
least a cell phone so he's two and a

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,439
half three and Nina you know safe to say

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,660
were somewhat attached and I've grown

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,189
fond of the little guy so I'm really

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,640
happy that he has a chance to see his

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,980
dad

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,300
okay so again as I was saying before the

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,700
livestream started thank you all for

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,989
being here we really truly appreciate it

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,020
how many people have been to all things

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,160
open before a good number of you how

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,730
many people are here for the first time

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,989
a good still a good number I would say

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,149
the minority of the attendees you know

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,860
people in attendance tonight have never

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,059
gone to know all things open so it's

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,520
great to have you if this your first

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,770
time kind of your first touch or your

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,230
first exposure to us it's really really

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,390
great to have you I will personally say

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,030
thank you before we leave here probably

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,799
five maybe ten more times I would

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,110
encourage you to find me personally and

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,520
let's talk before you leave it's really

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,320
great to have you here

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,960
and we're happy you're sort of part of

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,369
the community you're now honestly kind

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,330
of part of the family whether you like

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,619
it or not so we hope that you do attend

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,420
the conference and get to know us a

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,680
little bit better moving forward so I'm

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,560
gonna start tonight with the

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,360
presentation very very quick letting you

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,460
know some changes that are coming up for

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,869
all things open for the website things

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,850
you've been used to seeing for the last

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,430
eight years now that's really how long

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,770
we've been doing this so with that let's

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,299
get started and again I will move

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,820
quickly I do want to get to the

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,869
interviews and I especially want to get

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,549
to Andy Hunt because we really

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,689
appreciate him being here what we want

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,040
to do tonight is just kind of give you

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,899
an overview let you know what's coming

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,659
this year we've got some new things

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,460
planned we hope that you'll check out

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,049
some new platforms and you know you'll

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,579
actually go through and review and

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,490
engage with some of the new things that

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,520
we have going so with all that said the

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,130
takeaways this take maybe five or ten

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,719
minutes we do kind of just want to

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,910
reiterate what we do most of you already

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,009
know what we do but also let you know

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,400
who we are and just re-emphasize why we

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,930
do what

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,720
we think it's important we think it

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,150
bears repeating and you know once you're

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,760
fortunate enough to achieve a small

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,019
community or any sort of platform at all

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,620
the question becomes what are you going

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,450
to do with it

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,640
so we're honestly trying to leverage it

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,319
for good and trying to influence as many

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,019
people in a good way as we possibly can

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,299
so and I think explaining the why again

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,310
and reiterating and repeating that goes

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,720
a long way in doing that so I am going

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,920
to take just a minute to do that again

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,510
we're going to talk about some new

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,569
platforms and new projects that we're

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,549
working on and we're about to release if

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,109
you will and then also how you can get

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,690
involved as well because that's really

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,639
important it's not just enough to learn

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,739
about us or receive an email or see a

00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,859
tweet that we want you to actually

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,200
engage and and take part and participate

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,510
that's extremely important so the what

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,980
what do we do you're here so you know

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,540
what we do we host events and we've

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,939
hosted technology events for a long

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,310
period of time we're now hosting a few

00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,220
new platforms it will host a number of

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,709
platforms moving forward so not only can

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,239
you engage with us in person at live

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,010
events but you're soon gonna be able to

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,079
engage with us online in other ways as

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,810
well we've been doing this since 2008

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,609
under the name all things open I've been

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,709
doing this for probably five years prior

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,900
to that we've done it under a variety of

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,699
names we've hosted other events it's all

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,340
been open source open tech in the open

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,530
web everything we do is focused on that

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,269
space we think that it's a gateway to

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,349
opportunity if you look around it's

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,840
where all the innovation the creativity

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,419
of the tech space is really coming from

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,669
we think wisdom of the crowds works the

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,290
collaborative model works and to us it's

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,909
extremely exciting so that's why we

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,169
happen to focus on that particular area

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:51,389
there are other reasons to which I'll

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,609
touch on in just a minute we focus on

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,220
technology frameworks programming

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,199
languages that's great I love it you you

00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,250
like it most of you here that's that's

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,699
actually why you're here

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,139
but we also focus on processes we happen

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,419
to think it's extremely important that

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,310
in addition to the technology processes

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,139
they're really in some cases just as

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,599
important and maybe even in other

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,000
instances even more important so we

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,650
focus on processes as well and I'll

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,340
describe what I'm talking about in just

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,320
a second

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,359
and we also focus on established and

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,770
also emerging technologies as well so if

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,910
you come to our events you're going to

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,380
get some information

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,430
some content about things that you

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,980
already know about that have been around

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,840
a while but we're also gonna hit on some

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,100
newer things on the horizon we feel like

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,990
it's our responsibility let's you know

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,510
sort of what's coming and also introduce

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,310
you to some new speakers as well some of

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,590
our speakers are established veterans

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,450
but honestly a lot of them are people

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,980
that are really doing something creative

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,300
and new and they're newer on the scene

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,400
maybe they've only been in the industry

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,650
for a year or two five years eight years

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,170
etc but we want to introduce them to you

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,150
we want them to be the superstars of

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,280
tomorrow we want them to be the keynote

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,990
speakers five years from now and if we

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,180
can play some small role in that process

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,740
that makes us feel really really good so

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,660
why do we do what we do I don't want to

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,740
get too cliche edge here and those of

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,240
you that have heard me say this before

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,420
you know where I'm going with this

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,610
already but really there is kind of a

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,170
rhyme and a reason there's an approach

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,380
there's a reason why we do what we do

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,430
and and and in the way that we do it

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,610
there's still no substitute for

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,100
face-to-face as remote communication has

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,070
become easier it's become more

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,590
convenient we still say if anything that

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,420
has increased or heightened the

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,280
importance of face-to-face communication

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,880
there simply is no substitute for

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,520
getting to know someone in person I can

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,730
tell you that I always encourage anyone

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,880
that asked me yes certainly a cold

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,440
introductory email is fine or someone

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,040
making an introduction on your behalf

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,440
via email or via a digital platform is

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,690
great but do whatever you can do to meet

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,430
them meet that person in person face to

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,410
face go to a conference find out where

00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,669
they're speaking asked for a meeting ask

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,090
for coffee there's just no substitute

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:06,330
and I can't overemphasize that in-person

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,970
in at conferences it's where decisions

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,040
and deals are made things get done in

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,560
person things get done in events that's

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,840
what's really going on in many cases

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,640
whether that you know kind of on the

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,760
surface of sensibly speaking you realize

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,860
it or not introductions are made new

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,370
technologies introduced and it's

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,110
discussed and it's talked about etc and

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,540
Vanessa's where education happens as

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,100
well so we big believers in conferences

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,040
and events and meetups just like this

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,830
and in person in-person events

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,490
that's where things happen we view it

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,070
live events as gateways actually

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,630
gateways are and you know really the way

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,700
that it's phrased behind me here on the

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,880
screen is we view it as a seat at the

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,970
table I was advised very very early on

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,440
by people very close to me told me this

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,210
and at the time they told me I had no

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,830
idea what they were talking about but

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,770
they told me Todd either you're at the

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:06,150
table or you're on the menu how many

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:08,310
people have been told that okay if all

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,780
of you that raised your hands the person

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,270
that told you that really cared about

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,650
you they were telling you that to tell

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,510
you the way the world works you're

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,160
either at the table or you're generally

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,810
on the menu it doesn't mean people are

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,920
out to devour you or to destroy you

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,650
that's not what I'm saying

00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,120
is all it means is at a very high level

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,710
is that if you're not at the table

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,930
you're not engaging in conversations

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,160
involved in decisions involved in a lot

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,070
of the new tech and a lot of the new

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,060
groups and organizations that are formed

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,740
you're then going to be very reactive

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,780
you're going to be responding to things

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,610
that people do not a good position to be

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,880
in in my opinion and in our opinion

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,470
collectively so what we believe look

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,600
folks Tech you're here for a reason

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,230
technologies importance and influence is

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,360
only going to grow

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,860
it's amazing the changes that I've seen

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,700
over the last 20 years since I've been

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,660
in the industry everything in society

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,060
literally everything is directly

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,380
impacted by tech dependent upon tech and

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,050
moving forward that's only going to be

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,090
the case more and more and more it

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,540
behooves you to be engaged and to

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:09,210
actually take part and to participate in

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,950
some way with that comes great promise I

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,170
think technology can make society better

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,270
for sure but I believe and we believe

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,460
collectively that with it also comes

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,790
great risk that is the topic for an

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,260
entire talk what is the risk of

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,300
technology becoming more influential in

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,520
society in general I think there are a

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,080
lot of risks and I think those are very

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,640
real so you need to be aware of that as

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,560
well but we do need to get everyone

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,750
involved if technology is impacting

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,880
everyone and if everyone's consuming

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,800
technology we want everyone to be aware

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,630
of it to be involved in it to

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,640
participate and again to have that seat

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,979
at the table we think it's vital

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,050
so access really does matter segues

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,300
nicely into access we really truly try

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,580
to make everything we do accessible

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,040
we want you to be able to attend our

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,930
events we always find a way for those of

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,670
you watching or for those of you here if

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,070
you ever want to attend one of our

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,630
events and you cannot make it happen for

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,610
whatever reason financially or otherwise

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,779
please let us know we'll work with you

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,550
to make arrangements to make sure you

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,870
get access to what we do we think it's

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,060
extremely important that you're at the

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,010
table and you're participating inclusion

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,470
matters once someone has overcome a

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,950
barrier to entry then making people feel

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,020
welcome

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,220
it matters you're never going to get the

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,230
best from someone you're never going to

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,510
get their great ideas if they don't feel

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,220
welcome we honestly try to make that the

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,050
case at everything that we do we always

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,209
have from the very beginning not always

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,620
done a perfect job or the best job but

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,700
we've done the best job that we can we'd

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,560
like to think that we're getting better

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,300
inclusion really matters and it's

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,120
extremely extremely important and

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,459
finally kindness and respect matter if I

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,589
could show you in past talks I always

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,029
end with pictures from the house in

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:44,190
which I was raised and my mom doesn't

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,959
even know I do this but their images

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,390
when I go back to my parents house to

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,640
this day my mom has signs around our

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,589
house as a reminder that kindness and

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,360
respect matters and there are a variety

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,339
of maybe three or four of them but it's

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,110
seemingly around every Bend you see one

00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,910
and I have really come to appreciate

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,550
that when I was very very young it was

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,470
like oh god wait okay tell me again tell

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,230
me again again are you kidding me

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,850
however now twenty years thirty years

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,070
down the road I'm extremely thankful for

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,890
that it matters folks you all know that

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,140
I know but it does bear repeating in

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,510
result of providing some access and

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,430
focusing on inclusion and really

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,990
focusing on open source which we view as

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,209
a gateway and live events and getting

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,160
you in we think is a better really

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,300
better technology the more people that

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,920
are involved and contribute and

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,800
collaborate and participate I believe

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,410
technology the quality of Technology

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,959
increases and enhanced we all benefit

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,820
from better technology you get more

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,680
people participating which is extremely

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,620
important to us again it bears repeating

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,149
and then a better society in general so

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,860
we think decide is better off when

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,079
people feel welcome they feel included

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,670
and everybody's participating and

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,810
engaged I don't think that's always been

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,610
the case I think we're getting better

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,170
and I think we're going to continue to

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,779
get better as well so I look forward to

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,680
doing everything we can in a very small

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,600
way to make that

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,980
and we are a certified B Corp for those

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,379
of you that did not know that we

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,839
achieved that certification in 2018

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,850
almost two years ago it took a long time

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,499
to achieve the certification took us

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,259
about a year to a year and a half of

00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:17,550
effort we did not know and we're not

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,290
aware of some of the data that would be

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,029
required on the front end that we would

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,769
have to present and have verified in

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,999
order to achieve the certification so

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,889
because we weren't collecting the right

00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,329
data to begin with we had to go back

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,970
through another cycle of events in

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,319
another year of what we do and gather

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,869
the data and then present it for

00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,970
verification etc if anyone here wants to

00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:38,129
learn more about getting us becoming a

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,300
certified B Corp if you would find me

00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,220
I'd be happy to give you some

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,990
information make some connections for

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,910
you there's actually a local B Corp

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,709
organization meetup I believe that meets

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,209
here in the Triangle so maybe we can

00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:51,059
make a connection for you as well it's a

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,559
good thing all it says is that you know

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,600
you believe that there's maybe a better

00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,490
way of doing business

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,319
then simply focusing on the bottom line

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,360
nothing wrong with focusing on the

00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,220
bottom line everyone has to eat everyone

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,410
has bills to pay that's part of life

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,749
that's normal however there is a better

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,309
way and you know by focusing on maybe a

00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:10,499
few other things as well as you're

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,790
attempting to make a living and deliver

00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,429
value that someone is willing to

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,579
exchange currency for with all that said

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:19,470
all things open let's let's get to a few

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,870
of the changes so for the last seven

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,069
date years everybody that has a ten of

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,439
the conference I know you've visited the

00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:27,029
website because you had to register and

00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:28,559
you had to be registered before you came

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:32,339
on site and visited with us every

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,540
October so the website is changing I do

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,370
want to let you know that so if you

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,990
haven't checked it out yet I would

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,670
encourage you to do that last seven to

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,009
eight years it's only focused on the

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,040
conference it's only been the conference

00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:46,379
you come there maybe August September

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,149
June November

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,410
you know October etcetera leading up to

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,870
the event to register to get more

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,490
information from this point forward it's

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,049
going to include more information it's

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,220
going to change just a little bit and

00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,589
I'm gonna walk over here I'm going to

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,829
show you how you're already looking at a

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:08,249
screen shot but so give me just a minute

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:10,319
so this is just what the new site will

00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:11,549
look like this will take on many many

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,899
different iterations if you know

00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,360
anything about us we like to change

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,399
things up everything from floating Astro

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,500
- multiple variations of floating Astros

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,360
and animations we like to have fun I

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
think technology should be fun and when

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,850
you come to the website you should have

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,170
a good time and it should pique your

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,760
interest and you should be thinking

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,160
about how do they do that or what

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,870
technology was used or how does Astro

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,550
float in three different variations on a

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,720
mobile device we get a lot of questions

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,630
about stuff like that

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,700
so this site now becomes really more of

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,589
a landing page it becomes more of an all

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,350
things open universe sort of letting

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:44,850
people know everything that we do for so

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,430
long we've been doing a lot of other

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,110
stuff other events and other other

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,820
things though if you go to the website

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,620
up to this point you would only think of

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,350
us or know us as a conference

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,000
organization putting on one conference a

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,950
year nothing wrong with that we're

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,300
grateful that you know us at all but

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,430
moving forward we would like to let

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,769
people know that are new to us and sort

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,019
of coming to us for you know for the

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:08,519
first time that we in fact do much more

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,250
than that so that's what this site will

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,750
become so again not a huge deal but it

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,250
does represent a change so we wanted to

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,079
let people know that from this point on

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,430
when you go to the site you're not only

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,450
going to learn about all things open the

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,519
conference but you're going to learn

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,720
more about what we do and some of the

00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,550
other platforms and some of the other

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,170
things that we're launching so just be

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,449
aware you can see the spacewalk event

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,850
here we like the space theme you'll

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,800
always see us to do that I was kind of

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,070
obsessed with space when I was little

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,930
and my son 3 years old obsessed with the

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,690
moon and the planets he's following in

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:44,490
my footsteps I likes science fiction I

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,050
liked space so that certainly impacted

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,110
our decisions in which direction we go

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,449
with themes and design and animation etc

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,519
so it'll always be kind of a space the

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,560
reason we do that is exploration new

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,649
horizons always looking at what's coming

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,300
and thinking about possibilities etc so

00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,820
that's that's how that fits that's why

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,519
you've always seen kind of a space theme

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,440
with what we've done so I'll show you

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,769
this really really quickly and then we

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,930
will move very very fast so even on this

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,640
new website and again we're this is in

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,920
progress we're working on this as we

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,810
speak our team is for sure but these are

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,880
3d animations you can put your cursor

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,270
over them you can interact with them and

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,440
we use a lot of open-source technology

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,100
on this we use 3GS

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,070
we use green sock animation platform we

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,720
use view for some of the scaffolding etc

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,970
so we use a lot of open-source Tekken

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,500
this stuff and in the coming days in the

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,630
coming weeks we'll release a lot of the

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,160
code and we'll also release some blog

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,020
post and we'll tell you exactly how we

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,850
did it and then we'll engage with you if

00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,290
you're interested as to how you might be

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,210
able to do some of this yourself as well

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,340
so we think it's kind of neat again we

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,350
like to keep it fun and interactive and

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,660
I don't know playful is an overused term

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,120
but again technologies should be fun it

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,970
shouldn't be all you know frowns and and

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,070
and rainy days so anyway you can kind of

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,630
see a lot of what we do and again you

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,550
can come to the site interact this all

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,320
will change and in the future you can

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,000
get news will begin to release news

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,100
about what we're doing through all

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,110
things open again which is now more of a

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,940
universe type site encompassing

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,020
everything that we do and you can see

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,040
some of the things that we've already

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,600
posted are really a blog post describing

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,240
what we're doing in person here tonight

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,270
but also what we do seven steps that we

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,190
take try to try to ensure diversity

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,530
inclusion at our events just seven

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,960
things but we'll begin to go into more

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,090
depth about what we do a lot of people

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,010
ask us and I'll be the first to admit up

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,750
to this point we've been it hasn't been

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,400
intentionally secretive or anything like

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,350
that but it's just we've been so busy we

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,640
have such a small team we haven't

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,200
released a lot of this stuff so we're

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,300
going to begin talking about more of

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,890
this stuff publicly moving forward so

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,840
that is the site and where you can sort

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,490
of find that so that's again the new

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,640
site moving forward so please be aware

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,570
of that and if you don't mind please

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,650
spread the word because you know someone

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,270
coming to the site for the first time

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,189
expecting only to hear about the

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,980
conference and things like that they are

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:12,280

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,930
you saw again all things open as well it

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,260

how the attendance at the

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,430
as grown we tried to chart this out and

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,780
we started the event in 2013 and we hope

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:51,700
to keep that that upward trajectory

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,010

conference on sort of off on that foot

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,309
sets the tone it establishes the

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,870
narrative if you will that inclusion and

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,970
diversity matter making people feel

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,590
welcome it actually matters so much so

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,150
that we're willing to sort of put our

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,830
money where our mouth is so to speak and

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,480
do a separate event which is an

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,429
unbelievable event it's been really

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,720
really good and all of you that have

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,670
improve the event by all means please

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,200
let us know we would love to hear from

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,179

you're planning to attend well please

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,820
try to make that event on Sunday cfp if

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,559
you're here near a speaker if you're

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,900
watching or if you know hearing us

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,840
within the sound of my voice we'd love

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,730
to have you submit a talk in 2019 we

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,220
received about a thousand talks about a

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,780
thousand responses to the CFP we

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,300
featured two hundred two hundred and

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,990
fifty speakers so you know it's not in

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,750
part you know is it's not well we turned

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,760
down more talks than we accepted

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,350
obviously but we try to change it up

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,150
every year and we're always looking for

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,160
a variety of talks so please whatever

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,480
you do don't think well I've only been

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,480
in the industry three years what do I

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,520
have to offer please don't think that at

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,950
all we feature introductory level talks

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,400
all the time and sometimes those are the

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,840
best talks that we feature and then the

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,510
garnered the most positive feedback so

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,309
please please don't feel that way at all

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,470
don't hesitate to submit a talk

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,700
something new this year the kid how many

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,390
people here have heard of the community

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,429
leadership summit CLS for short this is

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,640
an event that John Oh bacon started John

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,720
MC the event last year CLS it's always

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,560
been on the west coast for the first

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,420
time ever in

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,340
2020 it's going to be on the East Coast

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,220
and it's going to precede all things

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,320
open on Saturday and Sunday it's it's

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,000
about open source community two days of

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,130
open source community it's been in

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,380
Portland it's been in Austin but this

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,580
year 2020 for the first time ever it's

00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,710
going to be on the East Coast in Raleigh

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,150
preceding our event so more information

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,980
coming soon about that I think you'll

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,990
really enjoy it and it really is one of

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,200
the best events in technology period and

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,260
certainly an open source for sure open

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,550
source 101 how many people have been to

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,900
an open source 101 or I've heard about

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:33,370
it okay good

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:34,720
we do this and you know what so let me

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,120
do this I'm going to show you the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,110
website that is live that's actually

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,820
what the website looks like

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,100
and again we're actually recording this

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,900
so this is good I would encourage you to

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,490
go to the open source 101 website we do

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,270
these in the spring they're an on-ramp

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:51,670
into open source ATO has been I don't

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,940
know defined by some is a more advanced

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,950
level event which we know is not always

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,660
the case we have a 101 track and we

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,400
feature a lot of introductory level

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,740
talks but I could see how people would

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,300
think that about four years ago we

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,520
decided we really wanted to provide a

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,650
day of on-ramp education and open source

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,300
if you've never contributed or you never

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,830
consumed if you don't know much about

00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,870
licensing or if you don't know much

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,390
about open source business models as an

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,820
example we try to take this data educate

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,770
you more about that let you know

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,450
really featuring world-class speakers to

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,700
sort of on-ramp you into the open source

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,440
space a lot of people think everybody

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,640
knows that everybody knows how to pull

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,980
down code and integrate it into an

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,520
existing code base and attach a license

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,200
or be you know understand licensing at a

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,370
minimum enough level that you're not

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,950
going to get yourself in trouble or

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,560
incur liability I can tell you that is

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,140
not the case we learn new stuff every

that said let's move to open source jobs

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,170
this is new how many people here have

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,180
heard me talk about open source jobs a

00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,590
few people so apologies to you for

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,020
reiterating or repeating what we've done

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,750
this is in beta but this is new and I

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,790
would love to get your participation we

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,190
have found that the majority of people

00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,950
that sponsor our events come to us

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,840
because they are recruiting talent this

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,720
will come as news to no one here in

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,760
person or listening or watching

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,820
recruiting talent is a major challenge

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,210
in some cases it's an obstacle to growth

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,170
and expansion it's a big deal finding

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,580
quality people is a big deal and what we

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,170
a lot of our events has helped to put

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,060
people together connect people with

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,040
skills and experience that entities

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,900
organizations that need them and all

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,570
we're doing here is just taking that and

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,620
we're trying to do that for the other

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,990
350 days of the year that we're not

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,030
hosting events so please check out open

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,770
source jobs if you go there now you'll

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,480
see jobs posted by companies like

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:42,560
automatic the companies sort of behind

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,780
WordPress Amazon etc etc so if you want

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,310
to post a job please post a job on there

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,570
if you're looking for help and if you're

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,630
in the market or if you're looking for a

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,550
job by all means please go to the site

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:57,770
and check out what's available the site

00:24:52,550 --> 00:25:02,720
itself this does bear stating the site

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:04,400
itself is different in that we really

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,890
try to focus on not just the technology

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,870
but on the process as well this gets

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,240
back to what I said before folks in

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,910
open-source process matters how many of

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,010
you at your you know place of business

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,350
now if you're a startup or if you're a

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,030
student or if you're just getting into

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,190
the industry and you're at a code school

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,050
or if you've been in the industry for 20

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,720
years how many people here have a github

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,910
account how many people pull code down

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,710
how many people contribute code how many

00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,740
people here would would consider

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,070
yourself well-versed and knowledgeable

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,980
in the area of open-source licensing

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,590
yeah yeah that's what I thought

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,620
so everyone watching only a few hands

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,870
went up yet open-source licensing kind

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,130
of a big deal kind of a big deal how

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,860
many people here work in an environment

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,060
with a governance policy a policy in

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,220
place that kind of establishes

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,130
parameters as to how open-source can be

00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,770
used in your workplace etc how many

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,600
people here have one of those in place

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,340
okay a few of you good so that means the

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,530
majority of you do not how many people

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,870
here have never even heard of it I I

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,130
know a lot more haven't heard of it and

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,440
you're not raising your hands that's

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,180
totally okay I got to tell you these are

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,220
the things these is what I mean by

00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,290
process this this is what I mean

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,930
in the open source space in the modern

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,450
IT technology environment where I open

00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,920
source is used and utilized these things

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,990
are relevant they're pertinent and

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,390
they're extremely important so that is

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,460
what this site highlights as well the

00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,690
fact that open source job

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,730
means not just the technology

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,460
programming language or a platform or a

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,380
database etc but it also means processed

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,000
knowledge and experience as well so

00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,760
that's what's highlighted on this on

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,350
this site and trust me when I tell you

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,330
that companies that are posting jobs

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,149
they understand that if you talk to a

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,610
hiring manager and you ask them during

00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:54,649
the interview process do you ask just

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,390
about technology or do you ask questions

00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:58,820
like the ones that I just posed to you

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,679
well I will tell you some hiring

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,299
managers do not it's because they are

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,110
not aware of what I just stated so they

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,059
don't ask about it

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,370
however I can tell you that once you get

00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,960
the job or once you proceed and elevate

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,149
get to a different phase of the

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,520
interview process you will be asked

00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:15,020
about that and if you can come back and

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,789
you can respond or you can point out

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,200
that you do have open source process

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:19,520
experience that you do have a basic

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,230
understanding of licensing and

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,330
governance policies and protocols etc

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,700
you will jump off the page and your

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,230
marketability will go up we've talked to

00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,270
enough hiring managers to know that this

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,799
is a fact a lot of them don't ask about

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,320
it a lot of recruiters that you talk to

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,059
nothing about recruiters and nothing I

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,890
don't mean anything negative at all but

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,539
I doubt very many are asking about open

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,130
source process knowledge and expertise

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,110
we're trying to highlight that because

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,770
we feel like in our experience it's

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:47,929
extremely important so open source jobs

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,330
open source core all that process stuff

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,220
I just said all that stuff that I just

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,630
referenced we attempt to quantify this

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,779
how many people here have taken the

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,370
survey cool a few of you have thank you

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,350
very much we really appreciate that if

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:04,070
you haven't go to open source score comm

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,380
and take a very quick survey for us what

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,140
we're trying to do with this it's a

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,789
straight up straight helped it is an

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,950
educational tool in an educational

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:15,080
platform we want you to take a survey we

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,750
want to qualify your knowledge when it

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,700
comes to open source process expertise

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,919
knowledge etc on things like I just

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,450
identify understanding of licenses

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,029
attending open source events

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,860
contributing code open sourcing and

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:28,850
internal tool or technology how many

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,140
people here have actually open source

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,580
something okay a few of you I can tell

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,890
you that if there are best practices

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,320
there are right ways to do that if

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,299
you're working at a company now and you

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,890
want to recruit better talent or more

00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,720
talent and you're having a tough time

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,820
a lot of companies what they're doing is

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,040
they're open sourcing cool things that

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,299
you're already doing internally well if

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,190
someone goes through the boss or the

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,809
person in charge or decisions are made

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,390
collectively and you say I have a great

00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,580
idea from in the context of talent

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,190
recruitment and talent retention we use

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,760
this really great tool that helps us out

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,690
wonderfully it's very beneficial

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,520
internally

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,110
let's open source that to let everyone

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,400
on the outside know what cool things

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,340
they could work on if they came to work

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,720
here I can tell you that a long pause is

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,090
gonna follow because people are going to

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,460
look at each other like hmm boy that

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,090
sure sounds good well how do we do that

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,410
what do we do who who's the expert we

00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,580
talk to somebody's done that before

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,290
because I don't want to incur any

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,970
liability and what license would we

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,380
attach to that and don't we have to have

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,540
a policy in place and who's gonna write

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,640
the technical documentation documenting

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,610
the logic etc who's gonna do that and if

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,410
the response is I couldn't take it I

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,610
don't know that's not gonna go very far

00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,410
so we encourage you to learn more about

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,559
it but that's what open-source score is

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,750
take the survey we encourage you to do

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,220
it and learn and access some of the

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,630
educational resources some of the

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,929
educational links that are on that

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,790
website try to do that for us here's the

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:55,400
other this is the final thing that I'll

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,500
say about score we've built in sort of a

00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,510
gamification aspect to this as well we

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,950
want you to know how you score in

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,380
relation to everyone that's ever taken

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,270
the survey it's not a competitive thing

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,490
you don't have to share your score it's

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,660
not about that it's just we found it

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,150
beneficial we thought it would deliver

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,679
value to let you know how you stack up

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,780
against everybody that's ever taken it

00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,169
where do I fall in relation oh I see I

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,240
got a 65 on a scale of 0 to 100 is that

00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:21,710
good or bad or is that better than 80%

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,510
of the people that have taken it or is

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,770
that better than 20% of the people that

00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,780
have taken it and I really need to know

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,220
more that is built in as well and you'll

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,830
see that on the open source core that's

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,620
new we're in beta you'll find bugs trust

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,150
me we're making changes and updates and

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,280
and and you know we're seeking

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,600
contribution so if if you take a look at

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,910
any have some ideas as to how we could

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,740
do it better let us know for sure but

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:47,660
please be on the lookout for open-source

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,980
score again that's new snapshot I've

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,020
been on the ground in the open-source

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,950
space for 13 years and I can tell you

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,179
common feedback that I get Todd how do I

00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:04,639
know this we exist to create opportunity

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,190
everything that we've done for the last

00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:09,950
eight years end of the ATO banner

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:15,049
honestly has been testing a hypothesis

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:18,320
in a theory can we do better ourselves

00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:21,980
can we survive and pay bills while

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,039
helping other people you a surprising

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,659
number of people do not believe that

00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,970
surprising number of people think look

00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:30,830
go for it help yourself first you can't

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,470
take care of anyone else until you help

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,029
yourself first to a degree that's true

00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,649
there's a lot of truth into that but

00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,019
we've again this has been an eight-year

00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:40,999
test of the belief that no no those two

00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:42,230
things can work together so that's what

00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:45,350
we've always been about and that's what

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,480
we'll be about moving forward so contact

that aspects over you got through it i

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,210
cannot thank you enough for your

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,340
patience and for sitting through that

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,220
here's what we're gonna do next we are

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,500
going to interview three

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,780
local organizations that are doing

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,910
fantastic work and the reason we asked

00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,080
them to come and sit for a five minute

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,780
interview we're actually taping this

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,580
tonight so we are gonna make the files

00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,660
available to them we're gonna cut me

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,060
we're gonna edit this down we're gonna

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,770
edit me out as much as we can because I

00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,780
want you to have content that you can

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,670
use to promote your organization and I

00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,890
want people here to know how they can

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,800
help you one of the reasons that we give

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,960
tables exhibit tables and ask you to

00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,820
come speak at events like this is that

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,160
we want people here to know how they can

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,410
help I am a big believer that most

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,290
people will help if they simply know how

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,120
to help that is not a blanket statement

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:51,700
that does not apply I was not born

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,680
yesterday I know that some people are

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,150
they have blinders on they're not being

00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,950
selfish it's just maybe the way they're

00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:59,020
wired etc there are selfish people out

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,610
there but most people will help if they

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,230
simply know how to help so our goal is

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,790
to let them know how they can help you

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,780
because you're really doing great work

00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:10,180
okay so Lisa come on up first group is

00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,750
local women who code we've been working

00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,640
with Lisa how many years four years

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,430
right so they have a table every year

00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,340
you've seen them at our events and so

00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:25,450
why don't why don't why don't we do this

00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:26,560
sit yep and again I really really

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:30,220
appreciate you being here

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,930
that is fantastic okay thank you for

00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,470
giving us the opportunity to be here

00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,450
very good

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,190
so who are you and what group are you

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,300
with and what do you do what is your

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,550
mission statement

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,050
I'm Lisa Schmitt I'm the founding

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,360
director of our local chapter of women

00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,530
new code for a global organization we've

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,470
been here in the Triangle about four

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,640
years we've got about the same number of

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:51,310
members as all things open that twelve

00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,570
hundred members now our mission is to

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,810
support women in their technology

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,750
journey working in tech my goal as an

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,910
old is to have more people stay in

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,470
technology women tend to leave it around

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,390
the 10-year mark so I'm trying to stop

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:08,230
that by providing all sorts of support

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:10,540
services what do you need I mean you

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,070
know part of the reason that we

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,710
initially reached out all those years

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,690
ago was because look I've attended

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,340
meetings I know exactly how this works

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:22,720
you need things you need

00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:25,810
maybe volunteers maybe you need sponsors

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,420
maybe you need instructors if you're you

00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,070
know offering or featuring education

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,869
what do you need how can people here

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,390
help you what can they do to help you

00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:37,410
out well we love all kinds of help

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:41,020
particularly we need location sponsors

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,450
typically those come with food if you

00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,270
are a location sponsor you get a in-kind

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:52,090
donation of a posting on the women who

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:54,040
code global job board and we're very low

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,410
maintenance we're typically meeting one

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,780
night during the week for about two

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,109
hours about same as this kind of Meetup

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,119
also we meet once a month for brunch

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:06,040
which requires nothing except for you

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,160
letting know letting women in technology

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,090
know that we're meeting once a month

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,130
we'd love for you to spread the word

00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,109
we're always looking for women to come

00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,180
and speak about all kinds of topics next

00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:17,260
month is understanding a benefits

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,080
package when you're accepting a job

00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,599
offer we also do get study nights we've

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,950
done API study nights and those kind of

00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,900
that kind of program and will continue

00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,310
so if you want to pitch in and

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,460
participate in those we'd love to have

00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:33,369
you but mostly we we could use places to

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,050
meet we'd like to I like to move it all

00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,460
over the Triangle to annoy everyone

00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,500
equally so that they have to everyone

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,089
has to drive at some point but so that

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,440
we can be more inclusive so that not

00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,680
everybody has to drive every time

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,540
spoken like a to organize yeah that's

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,980
something I would have said hey you bet

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,480

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:09,220
how many people here have heard of this

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:10,420
organization a few awesome so a lot of

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,329
people are hearing about this for the

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,520
first time very very good okay I think

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:17,230
you know maybe this is um I don't know

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,400
maybe I mean it was the case for me yeah

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,680
when you knew code

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,410
Lisa's group been around maybe maybe a

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,680
little bit longer maybe maybe uh ya know

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,779
we started women in tech allies Susan

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,160
found it about four years ago okay and

00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:34,569
we've sort of gained traction in the

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:38,619
past two years and about 1,300 LS on on

00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:42,160
meetup.com song but yeah she saw a need

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:45,490
I'll let her speak a little bit for

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,200
there to be an office space for there'd

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,630
be a conversation of growing diversity

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,950
in tech but that has voices from both

00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:56,710
sides of the table yeah so go ahead so

00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,180
we've we've really kind of started the

00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,680
conversation about what you're about

00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,029
what your mission statement is but if

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,910
you maybe could you know kind of pick up

00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:06,849
on that sure so I'm Susan watts

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,829
I'm uh I actually came in to check in a

00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:10,359
very non-traditional way so I was in

00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,309
property management with construction

00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:17,200
four corners and I went through a boot

00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:18,579
camp and I made that jump so at one

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,680
point they said you know you should

00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,750
probably do some meetups and go learn

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,079
some more stuff that I did that and the

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:28,450
meetups you know there is it's odd to be

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,369
the only woman in the room and there's

00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:34,460
80 people in the room so I thought mail

00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:37,130
maybe I'll go to

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:40,339
some women had to meet ups and and there

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,650
were great organizations like women code

00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:45,200
at chick tech and they had meet us but I

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:48,170
was like there's a there's a there's

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,440
room here because there needs to be a

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,540
gap there's a gap if you want to

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,369
interact with and build relationships

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,410
with people who are already in tech and

00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:00,380
the majority of the people in tech or

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,359
men then you need some way to bridge

00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,820
that conversation where you can

00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:07,250
introduce yourself to people who are

00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,580
interested in mentoring you sponsoring

00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,990
you championing you when they decide you

00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,700
know hey we're looking for some new

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,130
people who do you know

00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,359
well they tend a tendency to say who

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,920
they know and it's who they went to

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,540
school with and who was in your computer

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,970
science program and who they hung out

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,550
with and if that's only other guys in

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:28,280
tech then how are you ever going to get

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:30,290
the introduction right right so women in

00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,410
tech allies was designed to fill a

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,660
unique space I think that the women in

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,270
tech the most women in tech groups are

00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,710
focused purely on women and it's a great

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,910
place to kind of build those

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,950
relationships and have those

00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,640
conversations that maybe you you don't

00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:48,710
want to have in a mixed group but women

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,330
tech allies is this opportunity where

00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,010
people of all genders and all

00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,109
backgrounds can come together and

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,210
promote greater diversity greater

00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:58,190
inclusion into tech makes perfect sense

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,770
and I realized I didn't introduce myself

00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,330
I'm Alana Perry a kohli women tech

00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,760
allies with season I came along because

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:07,670
her her vision really resonated with me

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,990
a lot of my background have been in

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,550
different employee resource groups

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,950
within an organization to foster

00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,780
diversity but bringing it to the

00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,880
community and making sure that other

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,859
people saw the same opportunity as I did

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,050
by being a woman in tech was was

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:23,420
something that I'm glad that she planted

00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,099
a seed for and we've been able to grow

00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,290
it yeah well within a relatively short

00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,700
period of time here maybe 1,300 members

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,500
of you

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,869
so it's obviously resonating with a

00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,450
number of people yeah what do you need

00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,880
how can we help you I asked for a show

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,160
of hands overwhelming majority people

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,690
here I think are hearing about you for

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,950
the first time so they're getting to

00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,510
know you so hopefully tonight they'll

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,190
come up and introduce themselves or

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,440
they'll follow up with you maybe online

00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,150
or via meetup or maybe the email after

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,599
or Twitter's some form of social media

00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,579
but just in person what are hearing from

00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:57,400
you personally here tonight how can

00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:59,859
people help you um well you guys have

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,380
been missing out I'm sorry we have some

00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:05,500
great events we usually do at least one

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,960
of them a month sometimes two and they

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:11,800
vary in topic from you know very

00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,950
technical like hands-on coding to tech

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,260
you know project management or agile we

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:19,480
we jump all over the place we meet all

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,880
over the place we have we've had amazing

00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,160
sponsors that have offered us a space

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,720
and food so we meet sometimes in Durham

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,290
sometimes in Raleigh's we've got divorce

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,630
ville so we we have tried to create the

00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,420
ability for people to have it close to

00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,790
them every once in a while so that's

00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,910
been great I think the biggest thing

00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:42,280
that we need is for people to show up

00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:45,130
and meet each other because that's the

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,980
goal right the goal is to create the

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:51,250
relationships between people intact so

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:55,089
that the next time your your HR guy says

00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,940
or HR lady says who do you know you have

00:42:55,089 --> 00:43:00,250
somebody different to say okay that you

00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,339
can sponsor or champion or mentor

00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,200
somebody else that's maybe outside of

00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,270
your normal circle and that networking

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,390
is really critical because a lot of our

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:12,339
allies are transitioning into tech from

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,020
other industries they've graduated from

00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,280
boot camp they've graduated from college

00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,680
and they're just trying to figure out

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,150
how to break into this industry things

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,609
like just learning the nomenclature

00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,050
understanding agile terms things that

00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:25,150
you don't necessarily get before you get

00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,369
into the door being able to make those

00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,230
connections with someone and being able

00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:32,170
to kind of help push them forward is

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,960
what we're about and we would love to

00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,460
have more senior as well as junior but

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,210
senior people coming into our

00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,880
organization

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,520
making those connections that's great

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,640
how can people find you well Aulani is

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,280
amazing and he has created she's done a

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,340
lot to get us out there we have women in

00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,130

also trying to operate more for our

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,260
operational cost this year so we've

00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,670
added a patreon and a paypal account to

00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,800
our website for those who are interested

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,040
well I know a good number of people here

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,890
in person that run companies or are in

00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,540
you know positions of decision-making

00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,520
authorities so to speak and that can

00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,620
certainly help help you out so I would

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,750
encourage them to consider that for sure

00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,060

and years you've been working in the

00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,910
community for a long time and we really

appreciate what you do so I definitely

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,820

00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:21,010
everyone watching who are you what's the

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,540
group and what's the mission so my name

00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,760
is Maria Lamar though I'm a front-end

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,280
engineer at pendel and my group is

00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,990
called that's at RTP and our mission

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,760
statement is just to inspire and

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,550
encourage people to get into the tech

00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,050
field and I hope that this community

00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,240
provides a really good support system

00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,400
for you to ask all the questions you

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,980
want regardless of skill level and

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,210
you're always always welcome and you're

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:47,510
also an accessibility specialist you've

00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,330
actually spoken at our meet

00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,680
about accessibility as well Anna and at

00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,720
our conferences we think it's a pretty

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,220
important topic yeah yeah so my

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,040
background I'm a board-certified

00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,770
assistant behavior analyst so before I

00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,730
switched into tech I spent eight years

00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,840
providing the airwheel therapy for

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,630
people with developmental disabilities

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,510
and when I switched into tech web

00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:10,790
accessibility was just my passion yeah

00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,510
what can you use how can people here

00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,250
help you out

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,410
um well so we're always looking for

00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:18,200
sponsors but most of all I would say

00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:20,720
we're looking for helpers we have a lot

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,160
of big events coming up and we're

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,450
specifically looking for people who are

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,640
interested in being becoming instructors

00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,920
Martin's boost and I are launching a new

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,070
chapter for Nestle our keiki teens and

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,440
it's gonna be targeted towards inspiring

00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,290
the youth to get into the tech field and

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,450
have much earlier age that I did and I

00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:44,840
think that's really gonna help them get

00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,810
ahead of the curve and learn a lot a lot

00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,060
you know Denise Cooper our MC for

00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,890
inclusion diversity event she begins and

00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,290
ends with the same statement that if you

00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,850
whatever you do try to introduce your

00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,830
child give them a role model get them

00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,270
into technology whether it's gadgets or

00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,130
whether it's software or whether it's

00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,600
gang whatever it is get them in expose

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,880
them to it as early as you possibly can

00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,220
because it helps yeah I mean it really

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,970
really helps yeah where can people find

thank you again okay all right with that

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,760
I'm gonna clear the stage we're gonna

00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,510
reset the stage I think Andy's just

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,210
gonna speak stand and speak no stool

00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:40,549
needed so we're gonna do that for Andy

00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:44,630
folks I asked before how many people

00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:46,849
here have read pragmatic programmer own

00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,930
a copy have been influenced by the book

00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:53,630
large number of you said yes a number of

00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,980
you said no so I think this is a good

00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,260
opportunity for those that have been

00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,119
influenced and are familiar it kind of

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,559
maybe gets the backstory maybe have some

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,930
of the gaps filled in here from Andy

00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,240
directly and then also for those of you

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:06,950
not familiar you'll understand why we

00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,319
feel like it's the most influential book

00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,690
maybe in the history of Technology when

00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:13,160
it comes to programmers and by the way I

00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,559
would say this if Andy weren't standing

00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,539
right here I would a hundred percent say

00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,880
that and that's merely based on feedback

00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:21,680
from our community over a lot a lot of

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,299
years so Andy you did a great job with

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,829
the book thank you very much for being

00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:26,569
here tonight thanks for agreeing to sign

00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:29,059
books and speak to people afterwards and

00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:30,619
for those of you by all means I want you

00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:33,230
to stick around we're gonna do about 40

00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:34,910
45 minutes of talk and then QA and then

00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,349
we'll wrap things up and then we'll go

00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,890
right outside we'll have books sitting

00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,900

00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,470
for coming out I took one look at the

00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,450
temperature was gonna let my dog out the

00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,600
dogs like I'm wait until about March

00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,890
we're not doing this so yeah I wouldn't

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,490
have come tonight if I didn't have you

00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:16,760
know sort of have to so thanks my name

00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:23,060
is Andy hunt I have been programming

00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:25,230
commercially for money for 38 years

00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,720
I shouldn't say that anymore that that

00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,220
sounds kind of horrible and one of these

00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,800
days I'm gonna figure out how it

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,130
actually worked and and how to do it

00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:38,520
right I'm still working on that so back

00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,020
in the mid 90s towards the end of the

00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,700
90s Dave Thomas and I wrote the

00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,720
pragmatic programmer book which I'll

00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,580
tell you about in a second

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:51,600
and then in the early 2000s like mm mm I

00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:53,820
guess it was 2000 we wrote the the

00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,830
pickaxe the Ruby programming book which

00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,810
sort of introduced Ruby to the to the

00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:00,720
rest of the world and then this little

00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:04,170
thing happened where as one of the

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,230
authors of the agile manifesto trying to

00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:10,680
to get people to think beyond the sort

00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:12,810
of rigid linear bureaucratic plan based

00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,780
approaches and do something more

00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:17,880
effective a little while after that Dave

00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,130
and I founded the pragmatic bookshelf

00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,370
publishing company which is my

00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,350
quote-unquote day job these days I run

00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:28,050
the publishing company which is an

00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:30,930
interesting experience to sort of be at

00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:33,240
the whatever metaphor you want to use to

00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:36,690
be at the crossroads to have your finger

00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,580
on the pulse of what people are excited

00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:41,760
about what people are interested in what

00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,950
people think are important enough to

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,040
devote nine to twelve months of their

00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:50,370
life writing a book about that's some

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,080
serious commitment and you really only

00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,970
want to undertake something like that if

00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,450
you are really really passionate about

00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:59,150
the subject matter so that's an

00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:02,310
interesting data point to kind of see

00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,970
what's going on in the world and there's

00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,640
a lot

00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:08,940
going on in the world especially these

00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,990
days as they say so as Dave and I set

00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:15,990
out to do a 20th anniversary edition of

00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:19,050
the pragmatic programmer book it was a

00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,050
bit of a time capsule to go back and see

00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:27,840
well what was the development world like

00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:31,140
back in the late 90s versus today and an

00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,800
awful lot has changed right so think

00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:37,620
back to those days you know say 98 97 98

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,040
or so dinosaurs roamed the earth right

00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:44,130
grazing under the window peacefully and

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,770
the dinosaurs were named Lycos AltaVista

00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:48,900
right those were the search engine

00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:53,010
Giants everyone was really worried about

00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:55,050
this huge monopoly called AOL that was

00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:58,110
oh it was horrible they carpet-bombed

00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:02,850
you with it with CDs it was it was

00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:04,680
devastating and you know it's a

00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:08,970
different Google what Google was not a

00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:10,530
verb you know that wasn't a thing it was

00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,630
a very different world but a lot of

00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:14,180
things as we notice going through the

00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:18,270
book a lot of things haven't changed

00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:22,290
anything to deal with us as people as

00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:25,350
individuals as programmers developers we

00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:27,450
haven't changed in tens of thousands of

00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:30,060
years hundreds of thousands of years the

00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,190
tech has changed but you know it always

00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,670
does

00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:38,100
so back in the 90s what happened was we

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:40,350
did not set out to write a book at all

00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:43,320
let alone eight but what did Todd call

00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:46,470
it or the most influential book I know

00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:50,250
he's just being kind but he's not wrong

00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:52,530
and the funny thing is that was really

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,630
somewhat beginner's luck I mean we

00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,400
didn't sit down go we're going to write

00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:59,160
the most influential book of a

00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,920
generation now we were writing a white

00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,590
paper for our clients at the time

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,900
because it seemed what would happen is

00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,840
you'd go into a new assignment you know

00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,550
you'd meet with the client and my god

00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,670
the fact that they ever got anything out

00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:16,430
the door was nothing short of a miracle

00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,530
right just disaster

00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:22,040
disaster and they're like yeah well you

00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:23,720
know we're trying okay so it's fine you

00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,670
know the first one or two or three or

00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,220
five and then you realize everyone you

00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:31,100
meet they're doing the same things wrong

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,900
it's like okay well we can help with

00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:35,180
this you know how about think about it

00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,780
this way don't do it that way do it this

00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:41,090
way think about this mister context so

00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,280
we thought it might save some time to

00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,960
write down these little observations

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,360
these little stories that we had these

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,160
little anecdotes and just write it up as

00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,500
a white paper we'd ship it on ahead to

00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:55,820
our clients before we got there just to

00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:59,090
save some time and unlike every software

00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:01,790
project ever that project grew in scope

00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:04,160
beyond what we had had sort of thought

00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:06,380
and we were like you know this this

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,060
actually this this could be a book we've

00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,550
got enough stuff here maybe this is a

00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,890
book and someone suggested and I've

00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:15,050
honestly forgotten in the mists of time

00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,020
now who it was but somebody suggested

00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:20,960
that well find a publisher go to your

00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:24,460
bookcase see who has the books that you

00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,950
most respect and enjoy and contact them

00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,900
okay so we wrote addison-wesley at the

00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,490
time because they had you know the Gang

00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,990
of Four patterns book and all that you

00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:37,550
know all the classics the you know the K

00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:40,960
NRC all this stuff and so we wrote and

00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:43,370
they said yeah sounds good sign here

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,930
okay we dude we know nothing about

00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:47,320
writing we've never written a book

00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:50,690
before I have no idea what we're doing

00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:53,030
but we figured it out the very first

00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:58,720
drafts of the book were written in tear

00:55:53,030 --> 00:56:01,520
off there are some crickets back there

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:05,020
we ran up the limitations of that and

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:08,630
then moved it into la tech spelled latex

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:10,790
and and and it that way

00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:14,180
and so through the course of this write

00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:17,830
being programmers with a touch of not

00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:20,870
invented here syndrome just a wee bit

00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,940
most books were published then and still

00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,860
today they go through this sort of

00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,900
workflow where as an author you write

00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,450
the manuscript in something like well

00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,110
what now would be Microsoft Word or even

00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,350
back then

00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:34,940
you know maybe a frame-maker or quark or

00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,500
something but nothing out with any kind

00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,210
of formatting or anything you just sort

00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,680
of write the text then you give it to

00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,680
the publisher and they make all the

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,050
figures and they you know retype the

00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,910
code listings that you printed out for

00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,030
them and they send it off somewhere and

00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,550
type it in and just typeset it in print

00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,270
it and we're looking at this going

00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,790
that's stupid

00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,830
what why would you do that we you know

00:56:55,790 --> 00:57:00,710
we've got this nifty thing you can like

00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,600
include files in the thing that you're

00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:05,330
building so we built this whole little

00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,460
system that would you know produce a

00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:10,040
beautiful book we could run the code

00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:12,410
examples live on the disk with unit

00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,030
tests and all the rest of that and just

00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:16,370
suck the code right into the book with

00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,270
no transcription errors so we went

00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,100
through and did all that they're like

00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:21,860
okay well you know what typeset it for

00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:25,190
you it's like um yeah we're we're done

00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:28,160
we're all set it we're good we got that

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,690
okay fine they said okay well indexing

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,180
well you know publisher said we'll do

00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:33,610
the indexing for you okay awesome so

00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:39,110
they put us in touch with a professional

00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:41,690
indexer top men I'll tell you and the

00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:44,720
indexes first question two to us I kid

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:52,840
you not what words do all y'all want

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:52,840
indexed so we did the indexing

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,080
and then a few other things along the

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,910
way and by the end of the process and it

00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,580
was it was a handsome-looking book it

00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:06,150
sold well to our surprise it cracked the

00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:10,320
top ten on amazon.com not a programmer

00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:11,880
books the top ten of amazon.com and it

00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,980
would have been like two positions hired

00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,260
but they were to Harry Potter books on

00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:20,750
the list at the same time which I think

00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,700
was extraordinarily unfair such as life

00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:26,850
so we were we were as surprised as

00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:30,300
anyone and some of that I think at the

00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:32,400
time was really just an accident of

00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,830
history it was just the right thing at

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,450
the right time and it really struck a

00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:39,690
nerve and people are like oh this is

00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:42,480
this is a different level of advice than

00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:44,610
whatever they taught in university in

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,860
college you know different than I got

00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:50,460
from these other you know professional

00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:53,820
books and that was not without

00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,800
controversy so some of the very early

00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,540
reviewers of the first draft one

00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,730
gentleman in particular who's still

00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:06,020
around it's about 150 but he's still

00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:10,920
around was incensed that we wrote such a

00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:14,870
fluffy unscientific unsubstantiated pile

00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:17,670
of drivel and how dare we besmirched the

00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:22,830
profession by daring to suggest these

00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:27,780
things all right okay okay whatever okay

00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:29,100
dude you know have a nice life so it

00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,960
wasn't you know it was not a slam dunk

00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,670
by any means you know we were taking

00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,380
quite a risk because this wasn't that

00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:39,240
the sort of typical boring dry you've

00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,530
read those text books right the ones

00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,850
where you're halfway through reading and

00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:44,460
you just want to kind of know your arm

00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:45,120
off to get out of it and not not finish

00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,550
it

00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,590
we had jokes leo there was some funny

00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:52,260
bits in there there were some we made

00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:54,680
fun of UML diagrams we had some stick

00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:57,780
figures with Mommy & Me for use cases

00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:59,270
you know we poked fun at things that

00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,650
deserved it

00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,570
and it was a good time and you know

01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,490
mercifully it was it was well received

01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:07,450
and

01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:10,940
it opened up a lot of people's eyes to

01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:13,760
things that had been done but hadn't

01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:16,820
been described well so almost this kind

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,310
of like intellectual dark matter the

01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:21,470
kind of you know permeates between us

01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,000
and if you've worked with someone

01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:25,790
alongside someone and some kind of a

01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,640
mentorship capacity and apprenticeship

01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:31,550
the kind of deal you learn these little

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,890
tricks of the trade these ways of doing

01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:37,160
things these these approaches but

01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:40,040
they're not taught in undergrad courses

01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,770
to this day they're not usually taught

01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:46,880
in any formal job training it's just

01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:50,780
that stuff that's out there so Dave and

01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,910
I tried very hard to put names to some

01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:56,420
of these things and thus the dry

01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:58,910
principal came about we didn't invent

01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,250
that per se I mean it was an idea it was

01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:03,530
a thing that was out there but it didn't

01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:06,140
have a name it wasn't wasn't qualified

01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,790
it wasn't quantified in any way so we

01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,260
made up a definition and gave it a name

01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:13,850
and now it is part of the vocabulary

01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:16,250
it's you know we hear people mentioning

01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:19,670
it in conference talks in TED talks in

01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:21,710
books in courses and half the time they

01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:23,810
don't even know where it came from

01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:26,690
it's like okay well that was us that was

01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:29,210
it my son just just graduated this last

01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:33,110
semester from NC State just down the

01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:35,450
road in computer science and he called

01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:38,930
me up all excited one afternoon because

01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:41,570
in there once some freshman class there

01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:42,890
I was up on the screen alright yeah

01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:45,370
that's got to be kind of cool it's like

01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:48,020
hey I know that guy

01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:50,720
so yeah I that you know I guess that

01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:55,280
counts is you know Wow okay that that

01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,910
got you some some fight reality so where

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,110
was I going with this

01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,590
oh yeah so all these all these little

01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:03,080
bits and pieces we sort of put names to

01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:05,450
the idea that if you explain your code

01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,040
to somebody they just sit there and nod

01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:10,160
and as you describe it you're like oh

01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,800
crap I realize what I did rubberducky

01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,350
you describe it to the doc that came

01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,260
from the book and on and on and on the

01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,530
ideas of tracer bullets and well I mean

01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,790
it's

01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,560
on the book if you've read it you've

01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,790
seen them all and if not you're gonna

01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,330
read it soon because you're gonna get a

01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:28,390
copy tonight so so then you'll know and

01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:31,580
so 20 years came by it's like all right

01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:35,120
what what do we need to change what do

01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:37,310
we need to update given that this is not

01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:41,210
the world of the late 90s with dial-up

01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:43,400
modems and AOL and you know Lycos and

01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:46,630
all the rest of these things it was a

01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:50,690
very different world so we had to add

01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:53,540
new material you know we kind of called

01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:56,090
out the need for DevOps back then of

01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,890
course it wasn't called that so we had

01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:59,900
to revise some of that we had you know

01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:02,720
strongly advise you had to have a build

01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,220
machine except back then it was a PC

01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,540
sitting in the corner now it's a

01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,090
pipeline in the cloud

01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,960
same idea different implementation

01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:11,840
that's fine

01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,250
but that does that little change even

01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,680
something as simple as that

01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:18,260
that opens up a whole new world of

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,870
possibilities of other things you can do

01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,670
that are interesting and so there was a

01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:26,660
fair bit of that that okay well we have

01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:28,730
we have matured as an industry doesn't

01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:30,230
feel it a lot of the times but we have

01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,420
we have gained some ground we have

01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:35,780
learned how to do some things better you

01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:39,260
know I remember back in probably the

01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:41,000
early aughts I was in a large conference

01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,130
room maybe a thousand people or so and

01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,780
we asked for show of hands of who did

01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:50,900
not use version control of any sort and

01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:53,240
a bunch of folks in the back granted

01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:56,120
they were in the back kind of sheepishly

01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:59,450
raised their hands I did have someone

01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,620
tell me once with a straight face I said

01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:06,500
what are you all using for version

01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:09,410
control I said Microsoft Outlook I'm

01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:14,330
sorry I said version control yeah we use

01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:15,920
outlook how oh the end of the day we all

01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,970
mail each other all the source codes so

01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,970
there's a copy on the server

01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,640
I cannot make this stuff up

01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:28,280
you know that's right up there with my

01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,260
current favorite worry and again I'm not

01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,660
making this up I had someone tell me to

01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:40,670
my face of course our organization is

01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:43,730
agile we use JIRA so we have a ways to

01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:46,910
go still clearly but we have made some

01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:49,160
progress we had to add material to the

01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:51,890
book for things that weren't really a

01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:54,770
consideration back in the day you know

01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:57,950
back at some wonderful point in time you

01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,900
could VI main dot C and run a dot out

01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:02,300
and you know everything was just right

01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:05,060
there and it was beautiful and now you

01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:07,400
can't do that right hello world and

01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:11,870
react brings in what is it a thousand

01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:15,790
ten thousand NPM modules I'm sorry

01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:15,790
remote viruses from all over the web

01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:22,340
yeah that's that's yeah that's gonna

01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,960
come back to bite us well and you met

01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:26,000
what left pad right you remember the

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,660
left pad disaster about what was that

01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,080
two years ago ish where the the

01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:35,150
maintainer pulled a simple five line

01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,500
module and half the web broke because

01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,360
everyone was building with live

01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,580
dependencies and suddenly this thing and

01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,860
the repo wasn't there anymore and the

01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:46,580
whole thing croaked this is why we can't

01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:48,080
have nice things so we had so we had

01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:50,450
added that's a long way of saying we had

01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:53,390
to add a little chapter on just thinking

01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:55,400
about basic security because that really

01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:56,930
wasn't a consideration back in the day

01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,540
and now that has to be almost one of the

01:05:56,930 --> 01:06:02,330
first considerations security privacy

01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:04,190
how can this be weaponized could this

01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:06,520
thing you're writing be used against

01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:09,890
people could it be used against you that

01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:12,320
wasn't a concern not that long ago and

01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,790
now it's maybe the chief concern you

01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,900
know what are we doing with this data

01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:17,540
there's personally identifiable

01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,550
information there's laws about that

01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:22,070
you know if gdpr hasn't bit you yet

01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,790
California just did and they won't be

01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,440
the last

01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:28,130
right that's miss the tip of the iceberg

01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:30,770
so you know those kinds of societal

01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:33,470
impacts are moving in and

01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,480
as Todd said in the beginning software

01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:37,190
is everywhere it's not like software is

01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:40,910
going to eat the world that's that's

01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:45,850
that ship sailed it's done you know yeah

01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:49,010
hey a wonderful Twitter account that I

01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:50,480
this is being taped and shown so I can't

01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:53,390
say the actual name of the account

01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,630
because it contains profanity but it

01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:59,090
talks about the Internet of Things and

01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,680
you know points out these hilarious bits

01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,960
where you know you can't go you know

01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,670
this guy had to like put a t-shirt over

01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,920
his lamp because he couldn't turn the

01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:11,180
lamp off because the lamp server was

01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:13,640
down you know and these these kinds of

01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,140
things you know the oven that

01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,230
spontaneously turned itself on and

01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:20,510
burned the house down and you know all

01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,870
this great stuff and we're right in

01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,450
there

01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:25,850
that's that's us we are right in there

01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:28,550
with that so you know what may have just

01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:31,040
been a core dump or a crash or a blue

01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:34,880
screen of death that starts getting a

01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:36,470
lot more the death part and that's on us

01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,260
we have to be a little bit more

01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:42,620
conscious about these things so we tried

01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,940
to pack all these changes to the world

01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:47,840
all these new things that are happening

01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:49,670
today but still keep the flavor of the

01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,110
original pragmatic programmer book still

01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:52,700
keep as many of the jokes as we could

01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,720
get away with and some of them we

01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,980
couldn't some of them were kind of

01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,790
stupid the first time around to be

01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,380
honest so we ditched those the fun the

01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:03,440
interesting thing was when Dave and I

01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:06,830
first wrote the book it took a little

01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,740
over maybe two main years of effort we

01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:13,100
stopped taking clients and we focused

01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:15,280
exclusively on writing for over a solid

01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:19,790
year it was probably like 14 months and

01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:23,450
we would literally argue over exact

01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:26,200
words so first of all Dave's from

01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:30,470
England he's British so he talks funny

01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:32,570
and what's worse is he lives in Texas so

01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:36,070
y'all really talked funny with a British

01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:38,030
accent so there were some very hilarious

01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,740
misunderstandings where he would use the

01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:42,340
the British form of expression and I'm

01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,040
like what the hell are you talking about

01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:47,609
didn't did

01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:50,700
translate but we were very careful and

01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:54,210
very precise where we could be to try to

01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,580
get the right idea across because it's

01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,880
so easy to just mistakenly use the wrong

01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:00,839
word and somebody misunderstands

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,060
especially if you're talking about code

01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:07,560
you talk about some variable that's

01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:09,810
that's called X no no it's named X use

01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,549
the word called now you're executing it

01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:14,100
and people start getting it right so

01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:16,350
these very simple things but suddenly it

01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,210
can get quite confusing if you're if

01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:21,210
you're sloppy about it so we were very

01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:24,000
very careful and spent an inordinate of

01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:26,640
time really crafting and distilling and

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,339
honing the book trying to get it to what

01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,250
we thought at the time were sort of the

01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:34,560
most important things that weren't being

01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,380
discussed that weren't Howard in the

01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,810
open that weren't widely known and

01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,359
apparently that that worked and that

01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:44,880
paid off so this time came around to

01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:48,089
redo it for the 20th anniversary we're

01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,740
like oh boy we're gonna have wildly

01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:51,540
different ideas about what needs to

01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:54,120
change I'm you know how are we going to

01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:55,440
do this so each went off and separately

01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,480
made a list of all right

01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,370
here the biggest things that I think

01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,570
have changed in the industry here are

01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:02,520
the things I think we need to address

01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:04,860
here's the tips I think we need to ditch

01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,780
because they're not relevant anymore or

01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,580
you know we've changed our position on

01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:11,010
it or whatever it might be and Dave made

01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,720
the same list for himself and then we

01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:16,740
went and checked them against each other

01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:19,950
and 80% of the list was identical in the

01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:23,250
same order even it's like get that

01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:24,720
camera on me or something but and that I

01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,090
took that is a really good sign because

01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,320
that meant that you know despite our

01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:31,200
differences of opinions and and

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,450
different experiences that was pretty

01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,680
common you know we recognized alright

01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:37,710
these are these are the important things

01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:40,140
so that's what we focused on and the

01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:43,770
results you know it's it's it sounds

01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:47,070
self-serving because it is but it really

01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:49,020
is a fun read you know I enjoyed going

01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:52,890
back even you know proofreading it for

01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:54,990
the brazillian of time I'd you can never

01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:57,300
proofread it enough right you can you

01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,820
can look at something a hundred times in

01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,460
a row and it

01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:03,310
soon as the ink hits paper you find the

01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:07,389
to those in the row or whatever it might

01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:10,860
be but we did that we started working on

01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:14,369
that last spring we delivered it to the

01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:17,579
printer July first I think it was and

01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:20,199
funny thing our publishing company

01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:24,520
pragmatic bookshelf on the web at Prague

01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:29,650
Prague calm our authors when they finish

01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:33,010
writing it takes 8 to 10 weeks of copy

01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:35,260
edit and layout and indexing and then

01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:37,570
proofing it and these sorts of processes

01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:40,810
and then bang it's it's finished and

01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:43,900
it's ready for production and the print

01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:46,060
takes days we have it up in eBook that

01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:48,670
same day so it's it's moderately fast

01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:51,520
process my wife wrote a textbook on

01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:54,429
nursing informatics when she delivered

01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:59,320
the manuscript to Springer it was 12

01:11:54,429 --> 01:12:01,810
months before they had it in print when

01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:05,590
we delivered our manuscript in July we

01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:07,510
got hardcovers in September end to end

01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:11,770
of September and to September early

01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:13,690
October so you know we have claims that

01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:16,150
we have an agile publishing company and

01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:17,590
if you actually look at stats like that

01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:19,780
you actually look at numbers we really

01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:22,469
do we move stuff right along we get it

01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:26,260
out it's smooth that's streamlined other

01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:28,510
older more established companies not so

01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:32,050
much they've got a lot more process in

01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:33,579
place a lot more bureaucracy different

01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:36,610
market forces maybe different

01:12:33,579 --> 01:12:38,469
considerations but you know with

01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:41,800
something like a tech book right you

01:12:38,469 --> 01:12:44,469
can't let it sit around for a year right

01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,719
the world is moved by then you're on

01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:47,489
Rails 8 by now yeah or whatever it might

01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,980
be

01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:53,440
so that's kind of the short history of

01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,989
the book and how it came about and what

01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,719
brings me here tonight I think we've got

01:12:55,989 --> 01:13:01,989
time for a couple of questions anything

01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,969
at all not geography who's got the first

01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:06,040
question of course you have the first

01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:10,220
question

01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:13,400
ah an interesting okay so he asks what

01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:16,430
is the state of grows grows or the grows

01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,080
method was this initiative I'd started a

01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:22,280
couple years ago with my good friend

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:25,610
Jared Richardson and the idea was back

01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:28,220
in a 8 I wrote a book called pragmatic

01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:30,830
thinking and learning and that looked at

01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,620
sort of cognitive neuroscience ideas of

01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:34,640
how what can we do to learn better

01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,770
because they're a bunch of books out

01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,450
there like you know mind hacks and and

01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,890
these sorts of ideas that was all

01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:41,420
excited when they came out it's like oh

01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:43,010
this is I can't wait to dig into this

01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,990
book and see what it says and they were

01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:47,650
garbage they were all here's how to

01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:50,750
memorize a list of a hundred numbers I

01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:53,060
don't need to memorize a list of 100

01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,800
numbers thank you very much no here's a

01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,960
brand new language here's rust

01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,670
here's alum here's whatever I need to

01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,310
learn this thing in like two days tell

01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:04,040
me how to do that now I'm interested but

01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:05,570
that wasn't there so I spent a couple

01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,370
years doing some research and writing

01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:11,210
and found all these really interesting

01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:14,330
things about our own cognitive biases

01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:17,360
how we learn how our cognitive biases

01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:19,610
affect things like agile adoption why

01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,140
that doesn't work why we are desperate

01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:23,210
for estimates even when we know they're

01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:27,650
crap all these sorts of things I thought

01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:29,780
you know that and and institutionalizing

01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:32,420
learning you know the sort of corporate

01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,980
lndeed departments are usually garbage -

01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,320
right they send you off to the sheepdip

01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:38,210
training once a once a year and you

01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,730
don't really get much out of it we could

01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:45,110
do so much better so I wanted to marry

01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:48,170
the ideas of true agile not we use JIRA

01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:53,000
and half a scrum badly but actual agile

01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:55,190
ideas and these sort of learning and you

01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,340
know cognitive concepts and make a new

01:14:55,190 --> 01:15:00,800
methodology out of that and Jared and I

01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,780
had started and had gotten away to waste

01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:06,470
down that road when he passed away

01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:10,400
suddenly in 2016 and that kind of just

01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:11,810
that that was the end of that I stopped

01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,050
working on it for a while because it was

01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:18,680
just you know that was just too hard

01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:22,490
until this last year till 2020 end of 20

01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:24,470
18 20 19 - Jared's other friends got

01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:27,620
together with me and and we've we've

01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:30,010
brought it back as a functioning thing

01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,900
again and we've been doing workshops

01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:37,730
helping to teach executives the

01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:39,410
importance of the actual agile ideas you

01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:42,080
know exposing with things like kanavan

01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:44,570
diagrams and Wardley maps and you know

01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:47,240
those sorts of things the the actual

01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,860
ways of looking at systems thinking

01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,300
instead of linear thinking and all the

01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:53,540
linear traps that we tend to fall into

01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:56,030
and those sorts of issues so we've been

01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:58,640
doing that you know sort of on the on

01:15:56,030 --> 01:16:02,330
the quiet on the side we're working on a

01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:06,560
book on it that'll be out someday

01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:08,780
I don't think no promise is there but we

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,690
are giving workshops on that and they've

01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:14,420
been going remarkably well I've been

01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:16,730
very heartened by that so it's it's it's

01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,890
one of those things where you can

01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:21,080
describe something to somebody and they

01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:22,790
can read about it and yeah yeah yeah

01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,160
that's all fine but if you do a

01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:26,780
particular exercise with them where they

01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:30,530
actually get to experience it all of a

01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:32,180
sudden it's like oh I get it now so I've

01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:34,100
literally had executives who are like oh

01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,300
yes we're iterative and incremental and

01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,190
they didn't know what that they could

01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,020
have said we were you know Bologna and

01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,280
cheese they had no idea what that meant

01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:44,210
and then we lead them through this

01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:48,380
exercise and they're like oh that's what

01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:50,870
y'all meant I got it now so there is

01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:52,850
hope on the horizon it's just just need

01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:53,540
more hours in the day but thanks for

01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:57,640
asking

01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:57,640
who's got the next question yeah

01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:19,350
that's a it's a tough question and I

01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,760
think my answer to that will have

01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:23,000
changed over the years so so the

01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,369
question was you know how do you

01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,550
evaluate or justify what tech you bring

01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:32,670
into a project and there's a lot of

01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:35,219
factors that play into that certainly we

01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:38,190
want to use the shiny because it's fun

01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:40,830
and you know we want to do that but it

01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:42,840
depends on the use case you're in a lot

01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:46,080
of a lot of cases especially if it's a

01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,659
smaller mom-and-pop shop or a smaller

01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,880
organization you want old boring tech

01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:53,010
you want something that you can plop

01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,719
there and it will just work and nobody

01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,969
has to keep up with the latest you know

01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,610
third decimal point point release to

01:17:56,969 --> 01:18:02,159
make the bloody thing work and you know

01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:04,260
that's fine there's other instances

01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:05,969
where you need to be literally on the

01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:08,010
bleeding edge because you have to get

01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:11,850
that last ounce of performance or that

01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:13,350
you know whatever it might be so that's

01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:17,040
the kind of thing where I think you need

01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:19,650
to look at kind of a snapshot okay

01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,150
what's what's the context now you know

01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:23,040
what what is the user where's the

01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:25,710
customer actually need what's the best

01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,869
tool for the job that'll do that now but

01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:29,580
then look at that over time are they

01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:31,380
going to have to maintain this how hard

01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,659
is it going to be to get talent that

01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,969
knows that technology how hard is it

01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:37,860
going to be to maintain that how hard is

01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:39,780
it gonna be to deploy that you know

01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:41,429
whether it's you know on containers now

01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:43,949
or this or that or you know how is this

01:18:41,429 --> 01:18:45,869
going to evolve over time and is this

01:18:43,949 --> 01:18:49,590
the best choice that's going to match

01:18:45,869 --> 01:18:51,989
that that flow that's the real question

01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:56,460
because I think one of the traps we fall

01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:57,989
into a lot is if we even bother to look

01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,969
at all these influences and all the

01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:03,330
context we take a snapshot of right now

01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:05,400
and that's great what about a month from

01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,960
now what about next year what about five

01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,179
years from now what's going to happen

01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,670
with that if I had a nickel for every

01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:14,300
time a developer decided to go slog some

01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:18,590
log entries off to a database file

01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:20,090
and never clean them out and then five

01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,119
ten years later some little piece of

01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:25,460
code is there just hawking over what is

01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:27,349
this nitrite so you know little things

01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,239
like that and that's kind of an extreme

01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:31,909
example but we do things like that

01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:34,730
without considering what happens to this

01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:37,190
in ten years twenty years right because

01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:40,809
I think we subconsciously think oh this

01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,809
isn't gonna be running still by then

01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:47,960
he'll be replaced long by then

01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:51,020
not always I literally have some some

01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,540
bash shell scripts that are in excess of

01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:56,590
30 years old that still run

01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:59,469
I still use somebody still using them

01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:03,079
hey thanks for joining us

01:19:59,469 --> 01:20:05,900
so yeah you got it I would say look at

01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:07,219
the axis of time in addition to to

01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:12,159
everything else for fitness and

01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:12,159
capability next question

01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:21,810
what was the biggest change from 20

01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,810
years ago

01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:35,950
why Todd goes right to the hard one okay

01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:37,810
Phil so for the 40th anniversary edition

01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:39,640
I said you're just gonna you know plug

01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:43,420
the fiber-optic jack right into the side

01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:46,810
and have the AI write it for me yeah

01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:49,060
I would actually have to go back and see

01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:52,360
what the what we thought the biggest

01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:54,550
change was I think it was probably a a

01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,790
kind of a confluence of several things

01:20:54,550 --> 01:21:00,370
of items that we had to fight really

01:20:57,790 --> 01:21:03,490
hard for back in the day to get adopted

01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:05,920
like unit testing right that was a hard

01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:07,630
sell people did not want to do it some

01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,370
people still don't but at least they

01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,050
know what you're talking about now at

01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:14,440
least they feel guilty about not doing

01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:15,610
it so that's that's progress that's

01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,860
progress

01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:19,330
but a lot of that stuff has become far

01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,620
more accepted you know you said pair

01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:23,260
programming before and they're like

01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:25,300
Tommy we're not doing that you know what

01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:27,310
they'd have some kind of reaction and

01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:29,530
now that you know they've got mob

01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,940
programming which is you know even that

01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:33,010
but but even greater and they're

01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:35,290
reporting good good success with that so

01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:37,780
okay yeah we've made some progress there

01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:40,750
the whole idea of having your build

01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:44,050
pipeline and your repo hosted in the

01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:46,270
cloud that's pretty brilliant and

01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:48,250
empowering you know not having to

01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:50,380
maintain that server over in the corner

01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:52,120
and there that I don't know if this is

01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:54,340
in one of the editions of the book where

01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,830
I've just told it forever but there was

01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:00,010
this developer I knew lucky Pierre that

01:21:56,830 --> 01:22:02,380
was really his name he decided that this

01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:04,270
particular search algorithm wasn't

01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:06,430
running fast enough on this piece of

01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:09,670
hardware this was running os/2 back in

01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:13,180
the day so he went in and rewrote the

01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:16,030
process scheduler in the kernel on os/2

01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:19,060
to tweak it okay

01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:20,890
bold move but all right we'll give it

01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,360
and it worked great and you know they

01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,610
got the performance increase that they

01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:28,540
wanted and that was wonderful

01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:32,490
tiny problem it never worked anywhere

01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:35,230
else in the world other than his machine

01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:37,300
literally so I'm thinking this was some

01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:39,940
kind of like cosmic ray quantum effect

01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,820
kind of something because they got the

01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,860
same gear from the same

01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:46,740
loaded the same software stack on it

01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:48,900
faced it in the same direction you know

01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:50,880
what nothing

01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:55,110
it was the the most extreme case of

01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:57,210
works on my machine and didn't and that

01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:59,510
is you know you laugh right but that's

01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:01,170
docker right docker is

01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:06,810
institutionalizing it works on my

01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:08,880
machine ship the my machine so those

01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:12,960
were probably the the biggest changes

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:16,050
the biggest change is going forward my

01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,370
crystal balls in the shop but it is a

01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:21,270
hard one because you know a lot of folks

01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:24,480
are like oh eh ai ai ai no first of all

01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:28,350
it's not AI okay if you're talking to VC

01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:30,030
venture capitalists it's AI if you're

01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:32,160
trying to recruit people for the team

01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:34,590
recruiting talent right it's machine

01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:41,780
learning you're sitting there doing it

01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:44,400
it's linear regression it's all of this

01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:45,600
anyone who's worried and and this is you

01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,910
know this is something that gets some

01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,960
ink it says oh AI is going to take our

01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:56,210
jobs and steal our future you ever use

01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,210
the self-checkout at the grocery store I

01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,150
don't think I don't we don't have much

01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:02,400
to worry about yet I think we're I think

01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:08,490
we're okay there so I don't think you

01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:11,280
know if we get some assists via machine

01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:13,020
learning and related technologies you

01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:16,500
know something that will help us as

01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:18,540
we're coding great you know love it it's

01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,420
it's like autocomplete on steroids okay

01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:23,880
dynamite it's not gonna write code for

01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:27,000
us I would like to see us continue to

01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,440
sort of move up in the world and deal

01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,440
less with lower and lower level concerns

01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:38,490
one of the first computers I ever bought

01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:40,320
the salesman at the store cracked open

01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:42,180
the floppy drive the eight inch floppy

01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,370
drive and checked it out on an

01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,990
oscilloscope before sending it home with

01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:48,900
way to make sure the heads were aligned

01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:51,450
and everything that was the tech at the

01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:54,300
day things have changed a little bit

01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:55,150
we've moved up levels of abstraction

01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,820
from that

01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:59,800
right a little bit and we've got kind of

01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,270
the precarious stack now because right

01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,790
the you know the ten thousand NPM

01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:06,640
modules and all the rest of that and

01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:08,380
that's kind of curious I don't I not

01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:11,230
sure how that's gonna play out because

01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:13,720
that seems to me that that's running up

01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:16,120
against the you know security and and

01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:17,860
verifiability kind of concerns and

01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,860
they're really at loggerheads there

01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:23,140
because now we expect this level of

01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:25,390
support that oh there's there's a gem

01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:27,760
for that there's a there's a module for

01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:29,500
that I can just grab this set of

01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,710
features and shove it into my project

01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:34,510
without knowing what it really is

01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:38,710
mmm usually in sci-fi movies that

01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:43,120
doesn't work out real well so we'll see

01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:53,230
it'll be interesting that's for sure got

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:57,700
time for one more civic hacking like

01:25:53,230 --> 01:26:00,450
like like hacking government - yeah

01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,830
hacking in the in the good sense as it I

01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:04,960
think somebody needs to build a

01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:09,510
government that works I'd be that'd be a

01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:11,620
really nice nice change of pace you know

01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:15,340
thank you I'm here all week don't forget

01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:18,490
to tip your waitress yeah I I would like

01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:20,380
to I mean you know that and this is this

01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:23,200
is one of the other themes that was not

01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:26,650
in the original action that we added in

01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:30,280
this edition was to try to convey some

01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:33,090
sense of our responsibility in this mess

01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:36,580
because the world does run on our

01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:39,520
software and when we forget to check

01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:41,890
some air condition or you know we just

01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:45,820
program that happy path and hey ship it

01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:48,820
or agile you know there's serious

01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:50,320
repercussions you know you know the fact

01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:53,290
that Twitter can be used to take down

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:58,330
governments that was really cool when it

01:26:53,290 --> 01:27:00,090
was somebody else's right but yeah we

01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:02,200
there's a lot of responsibility for that

01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:04,030
all these articles about the

01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,310
insecurities of the voting machines I

01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:07,870
mean that's just appalling you know

01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:08,770
they've got these these closed source

01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:11,620
things we

01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,570
wide open bugs known vulnerabilities

01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:16,510
sitting there without passwords on the

01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:19,810
open Internet that strikes me as a

01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:21,640
remarkably poor idea and we can do

01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:26,550
better and no it doesn't take blockchain

01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,550
but that's another buzzword compliant

01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:53,290
alright one more I can't help it they've

01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:55,330
run out don't do it they have one of the

01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:57,490
interviewees earlier said that there was

01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:59,110
a problem with with women dropping out

01:27:57,490 --> 01:28:01,210
of tech at the 10-year mark it's like

01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:09,210
yeah cuz they realized what they'd

01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:09,210
gotten into and bolted the biggest thing

01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:16,570
well it's a pity it depends on what axis

01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:18,430
so I think the most important skill you

01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:22,150
need the most important skill you need

01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:24,850
to develop is being able to unlearn

01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:26,140
quickly now most people say well you

01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:28,480
need to be able to learn quickly yes

01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,550
certainly of course but in order to do

01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:34,060
that you've got to be able to unlearn

01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:35,890
quickly so you know they took and they

01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,870
even told me this when I was in college

01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:40,900
back in we had you know stone tablets

01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:42,520
and and stuff like that they said you

01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,950
know really whatever we whatever

01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,840
technology we teach you in college you

01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:49,060
will not use out in the workplace it'll

01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,850
it'll be dead by then it'll be on to

01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:54,880
something else and yes indeed so I spent

01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:58,630
two years programming a modulo to what

01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:01,600
whoo yeah I never heard of it yeah that

01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:03,910
happens so you know there are folks who

01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,590
are like oh I've gone to a coding boot

01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:07,600
camp and I've learned this you know part

01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:09,130
of this one language I'm all set I'm

01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,760
done mmm

01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:15,520
not even close right the the trick the

01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:17,050
neck is to learn something learn the

01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,700
next thing learn something very

01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:21,550
different from that so say you've

01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:22,150
learned a Python or Ruby as a beginning

01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:24,730
programming

01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:25,270
language good start awesome good place

01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,400
to go

01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:29,290
then learn a functional programming

01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:33,489
language take a look at something really

01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:36,449
wacky like Prolog or sequel everyone

01:29:33,489 --> 01:29:38,440
needs to know SQL at some point right

01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:41,159
you know look at all these different

01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,620
aspects of a thing and you start to

01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:45,610
understand kind of the the more

01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:48,159
fundamental basics of like information

01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:49,810
theory so then when someone comes up and

01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,760
tries to explain a monad to you it's

01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:54,699
like yeah lks it's one of these kind of

01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:58,929
things fine or whatever it might be but

01:29:54,699 --> 01:30:00,580
the key is you can't hang on to the

01:29:58,929 --> 01:30:02,650
thing you learned first or the first

01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:07,239
several things that you learned you know

01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:08,830
when when C++ came out back in the day

01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:12,370
and it's like hey it's object-oriented

01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:13,540
if you squint people still wrote C code

01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:15,880
in C++

01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:17,290
it was procedural it was linear and the

01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,150
same thing happens today it's okay I've

01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:20,469
learned Ruby I got real objects this is

01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:21,850
great now I'm going to program a lick

01:30:20,469 --> 01:30:23,469
sir and they're not writing it in

01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:26,110
functional style they're writing it in

01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:28,480
object style and you know trying to

01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:32,650
shoehorn it in because it's very

01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:34,480
difficult to throw out the mental models

01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:36,760
that you've developed the the learnings

01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,140
that you've had this is the way you do

01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,870
it and now you're telling me I've got to

01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:43,179
do it completely differently okay

01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,590
that's valuable to learn and then do it

01:30:43,179 --> 01:30:47,050
completely differently again with some

01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:50,170
other paradigms some other style and you

01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:53,469
just keep doing that then you start to

01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:55,000
get that appreciation of all little bits

01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:56,890
that no one can teach you that that

01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,739
intellectual dark-matter that's kind of

01:30:56,890 --> 01:31:02,860
binding us all together it's like oh I

01:30:59,739 --> 01:31:04,840
know what Andy was talking about now so

01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,179
that's what I would suggest great

01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,620
question thanks for asking it well thank

01:31:07,179 --> 01:31:10,620
