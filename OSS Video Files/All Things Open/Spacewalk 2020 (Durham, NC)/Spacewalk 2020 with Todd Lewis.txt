[Music]

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,600
thank you all and to my son Grayson a I

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,830
love you he's supposed to be watching I

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,080
hope his mom has him in front of a

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,289
computer or at least a cell phone so

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,940
he's two and a half three and I mean you

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,880
know safe to say were somewhat attached

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,500
and I've grown fond of the little guy so

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,190
I'm really happy that he has a chance to

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,530
see his dad

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,850
okay so again as I was saying before the

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,190
livestream started thank you all for

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,539
being here we really truly appreciate it

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,570
how many people have been to all things

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,680
open before a good number of you how

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,280
many people are here for the first time

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,539
a good still a good number I would say

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,670
the minority of the attendees you know

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,410
people in attendance tonight have never

00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,609
gone to know all things open so it's

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,070
great to have you if this your first

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,290
time kind of your first touch or your

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,780
first exposure to us it's really really

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,150
great to have you I will personally say

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,580
thank you before we leave here probably

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,320
five maybe ten more times I would

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,659
encourage you to find me personally and

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,880
let's talk before you leave it's really

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,380
great to have you here and we're happy

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,869
you're sort of part of the community

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,009
you're now honestly kind of part of the

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,150
family whether you like it or not so we

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,560
hope that you do attend the conference

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,479
and get to know us a little bit better

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
moving forward so I'm gonna start

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,040
tonight with the presentation very very

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,049
quick letting you know some changes that

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
are coming up for all things open for

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,680
the website things you've been used to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,939
seeing for the last eight years now

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,240
that's really how long we've been doing

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,520
this so with that let's get started and

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,920
again I will move quickly I do want to

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,180
get to the interviews and I especially

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,950
want to get to Andy Hunt because we

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,000
really appreciate him being here what we

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,200
want to do tonight is just kind of

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,939
giving you an overview let you know

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,640
what's coming this year we've got some

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,710
new things planned we help that you'll

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,909
check out some new platforms and you

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,799
know you'll actually go through and

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,750
review and engage with some of the new

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,560
things that we have going so with all

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,040
that said take aways this take maybe

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,870
five or ten minutes

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,700
we do kind of just want to reiterate

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,799
what we do most of you already know what

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,989
we do but also let you know who we are

00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,459
and just re-emphasize why we do what we

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,280
do we think it's important we think it

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,709
bears repeating and you know once you're

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,319
fortunate enough to achieve a small

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,519
community or any sort of platform at all

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,180
the question becomes what are you going

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,980
to do with it

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,200
so we're honestly trying to leverage it

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,849
for good and trying to influence as many

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,549
people in a good way as we possibly can

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,829
so and I think explaining the why again

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,870
and reiterating and repeating that goes

00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,280
a long way in doing that so I am going

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,480
to take just a minute to do that again

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,040
we're going to talk about some new

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,129
platforms and new projects that we're

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,049
working on and we're about to release if

00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,579
you will and then also how you can get

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,250
involved as well because that's really

00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:59,170
important it's not just enough to learn

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,269
about us or receive an email or see a

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,390
tweet that we want you to actually

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,730
engage and and take part and participate

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,040
that's extremely important so the what

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,510
what do we do you're here so you know

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,069
what we do we host events and we've

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,470
hosted technology events for a long

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,870
period of time we're now hosting a few

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,750
new platforms and we'll host a number of

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,269
platforms moving forward so not only can

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,680
you engage with us in person at live

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,299
events but you're soon going to be able

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,639
to engage with us online in other ways

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,370
as well we've been doing this since 2008

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,139
under the name all things open I've been

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,269
doing this for probably five years prior

00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,430
to that we've done it under a variety of

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,230
names we've hosted other events it's all

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,900
been open source open tech in the open

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,090
web everything we do is focused on that

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,829
space we think that it's a gateway to

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,880
opportunity if you look around it's

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,209
where all the innovation the creativity

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,950
of the tech space is really coming from

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,200
we think wisdom of the crowds works the

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,849
collaborative model works and to us it's

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,410
extremely exciting so that's why we

00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,730
happen to focus on that particular area

00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,919
there are other reasons to which I'll

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,169
touch on in just a minute we focused on

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,750
technology frameworks programming

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,730
languages that's great I love it you you

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,260
like it most of you here that's that's

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,560
actually why you're here but we also

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,879
focus on processes we happen to think

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,129
it's extremely important that in

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,840
addition to the technology processes

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,699
they're really in some cases just as

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,130
important and maybe even in other

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,530
instances even more important so we

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,860
focus on processes as well and I'll

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,870
describe what I'm talking

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,729
in just a second and we also focus on

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,169
established and also emerging

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,759
technologies as well so if you come to

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,710
our events you're gonna get some

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,699
information to some content about things

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,259
that you already know about that have

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,389
been around a while but we're also gonna

00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,770
hit on some newer things on the horizon

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,599
we feel like it's our responsibility

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,729
let's you know sort of what's coming and

00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,569
also introduce you to some new speakers

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,400
as well

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,469
some of our speakers are established

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,810
veterans but honestly a lot of them are

00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,219
people that are really doing something

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,479
creative and new and they're newer on

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:55,580
the scene maybe they've only been in the

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,469
industry for a year or two five years

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,900
eight years etc but we want to introduce

00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:01,580
them to you we want them to be the

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,830
superstars of tomorrow we want them to

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,930
be the keynote speakers five years from

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,460
now and if we can play some small role

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,349
in that process that makes us feel

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,090
really really good so why do we do what

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,770
we do I don't want to get to cliches

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,629
here and those of you that have heard me

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,810
say this before you know where I'm going

00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,819
with this already but really there is

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,319
kind of a rhyme and a reason there's an

00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,810
approach there's a reason why we do what

00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,969
we do and and and in the way that we do

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,150
it there's still no substitute for

00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:31,610
face-to-face as remote communication has

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,330
become easier it's become more

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,379
convenient

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,610
we still think if anything that has

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,469
increased or heightened the importance

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,330
of face-to-face communication there

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:44,839
simply is no substitute for getting to

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,180
know someone in person I can tell you

00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,270
that I always encourage anyone that

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,419
asked me yes certainly a cold

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,979
introductory email is fine or someone

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,580
making an introduction on your behalf

00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:00,979
via email or the digital platform is

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,250
great but do whatever you can do to meet

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,589
them

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,969
meet that person in person face to face

00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,949
go to a conference find out where

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,210
they're speaking asked for a meeting ask

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,199
for coffee there's just no substitute

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:15,050
and I can't overemphasize that in person

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,509
and at conferences it's where decisions

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,550
and deals are made things get done in

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,099
person things get done in events that's

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,379
what's really going on in many cases

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,180
whether that you know kind of on the

00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,300
surface of sensibly speaking you realize

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,430
it or not introductions are made new

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,909
technologies introduced and it's

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,649
discussed and it's talked about etc and

00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,000
Vanessa's where education happens as

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,740
well so we big

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
leavers in conferences and events and

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,060
meetups just like this and in person in

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,300
person events because that's where

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:51,440
things happen we view it live events as

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,150
gateways actually gateways are and you

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,130
know really the way that it's phrased

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,170
behind me here on the screen is we view

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,140
it as a seat at the table

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,690
I was advised very very early on by

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,160
people very close to me told me this and

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,870
at the time they told me I had no idea

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,790
what they were talking about but they

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,550
told me Todd either you're at the table

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:15,650
or you're on the menu how many people

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,120
have been told that okay all of you that

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,490
raised your hands the person that told

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
you that really cared about you they

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,669
were telling you that to tell you the

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
way the world works you're either at the

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,300
table or you're generally on the menu it

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,800
doesn't mean people are out to devour

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,860
you or to destroy you that's not what

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm saying is all it means is at a very

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,560
high level is that if you're not at the

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,270
table you're not engaging in

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,310
conversations involved in decisions

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,900
involved in a lot of the new tech and a

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,120
lot of the new groups and organizations

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,320
that are formed you're then going to be

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,540
very reactive you're going to be

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,860
responding to things that people do not

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,010
a good position to be in in my opinion

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,740
and in our opinion collectively so what

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,630
we believe look folks Tech you're here

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,770
for a reason technologies importance and

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,930
influence is only going to grow

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,400
it's amazing the changes that I've seen

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,240
over the last 20 years since I've been

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,140
in the industry everything in society

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,600
literally everything is directly

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,919
impacted by tech dependent upon tech and

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,590
moving forward that's only going to be

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,780
the case more and more and more it

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,080
behooves you to be engaged and to

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,750
actually take part and to participate in

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,490
some way with that comes great promise I

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,510
think technology can make society better

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,710
for sure

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,810
but I believe and we believe

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,970
collectively that with it also comes

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,330
great risk that is the topic for an

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,800
entire talk what is the risk of

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,839
technology becoming more influential in

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,060
society in general I think there are a

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,620
lot of risks and I think those are very

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,180
real so you need to be aware of that as

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,099
well but we do need to get everyone

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,289
involved if technology is impacting

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,420
everyone and if everyone's consuming

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,339
technology we want everyone to be aware

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,170
of it to be involved in it to

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,180
participate and again to have that seat

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,400
at the table we think it's vital

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,020
so access

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,820
really does matter segues nicely into

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,880
access we really truly try to make

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,560
everything we do accessible we want you

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,690
to be able to attend our events we

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,880
always find a way for those of you

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,590
watching or for those of you here if you

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,600
ever want to attend one of our events

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,920
and you cannot make it happen for

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,140
whatever reason financially or otherwise

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,340
please let us know we'll work with you

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,110
to make arrangements to make sure you

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,430
get access to what we do we think it's

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,590
extremely important that you're at the

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,570
table and you're participating inclusion

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,030
matters once someone has overcome a

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,510
barrier to entry then making people feel

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,580
welcome

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,750
it matters you're never going to get the

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,760
best from someone you're never going to

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,070
get their great ideas if they don't feel

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,570
welcome we honestly try to make that the

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,340
case that everything that we do we

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,870
always have from the very beginning not

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,700
always done a perfect job or the best

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,870
job but we've done the best job that we

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,820
can we'd like to think that we're

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,620
getting better inclusion really matters

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,810
and it's extremely extremely important

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,540
and finally kindness and respect matter

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,820
if I could show you in past talks I

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,650
always end with pictures from the house

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,750
in which I was raised and my mom doesn't

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,490
even know I do this but their images

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,920
when I go back to my parents house to

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,200
this day my mom has signs around our

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,150
house as a reminder that kindness and

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,920
respect matters and there are a variety

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,900
of maybe three or four of them but it's

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,670
seemingly around every Bend you see one

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,410
and I have really come to appreciate

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,200
that when I was very very young it was

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,660
like uh golly okay tell me again tell me

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,090
again again are you kidding me however

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,040
now twenty years thirty years down the

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,900
road I'm extremely thankful for that it

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,170
matters folks you all know that I know

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,780
but it does bear repeating in result of

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,940
providing some access and focusing on

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,560
inclusion and really focusing on open

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,690
source which we view as a gateway and

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,150
live events and getting you in we think

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,940
is a better really better technology the

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,890
more people that are involved and

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,220
contribute and collaborate and

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,170
participate I believe technology the

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,330
quality of Technology increases and

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,760
enhanced we all benefit from better

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,470
technology you get more people

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,360
participating which is extremely

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,180
important to us again it bears repeating

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,680
and then a better society in general so

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,600
we think decide is better off when

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,610
people feel welcome they feel included

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,200
and everybody's participating and

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,860
engaged I don't think that's always been

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,510
the case

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,070
we're getting better and I think we're

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,170
gonna continue to get better as well so

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,000
I look forward to doing everything we

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,010
can in a very small way to make that

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,540
happen we are a certified B Corp for

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,940
those of you that did not know that we

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,400
achieve that certification in 2018

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,410
almost two years ago it took a long time

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,030
to achieve the certification took us

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,790
about a year to a year and a half of

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,990
effort we did not know and we're not

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,820
aware of some of the data that would be

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,560
required on the front end that we would

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,300
have to present and have verified in

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,530
order to achieve the certification so

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,450
because we weren't collecting the right

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,920
data to begin with we had to go back

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,530
through another cycle of events and

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
another year of what we do and gather

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,400
the data and then present it for

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,320
verification etc if anyone here wants to

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,660
learn more about getting us to becoming

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,860
a certified B Corp if you would find me

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,750
I'd be happy to give you some

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,550
information make some connections for

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,440
you there's actually a local B Corp

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,240
organization meetup I believe that meets

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,770
here in the Triangle so maybe we can

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,590
make a connection for you as well it's a

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,090
good thing all it says is that you know

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,010
you believe that there's maybe a better

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,050
way of doing business

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,850
then simply focusing on the bottom line

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,890
nothing wrong with focusing on the

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,780
bottom line everyone has to eat everyone

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,910
has bills to pay that's part of life

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,280
that's normal however there is a better

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,840
way and you know by focusing on maybe a

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,030
few other things as well as you're

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,350
attempting to make a living and deliver

00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,960
value that someone is willing to

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,140
exchange currency for with all that said

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,120
all things open let's let's get to a few

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,340
of the changes so for the last seven to

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,630
eight years everybody that has attended

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,970
the conference I know you visited the

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,590
website because you had to register and

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,090
you had to be registered before you came

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,870
on site and visited with us every

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,100
October so the website is changing I do

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,900
want to let you know that so if you

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,490
haven't checked it out yet I would

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,200
encourage you to do that last seven to

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,540
eight years it's only focused on the

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,570
conference it's only been the conference

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,080
you do come there maybe August September

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,700
June November you know October etcetera

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,260
leading up to the event to register to

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,360
get more information from this point

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,830
forward it's going to include more

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
information it's going to change just a

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,340
little bit and I'm gonna walk over here

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,410
I'm going to show you how you're already

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:15,380
looking at a screenshot but so give me

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,780
just a minute so this is just

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,250
what the new site will look like this

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,810
will take on many many different

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,730
iterations if you know anything about us

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,560
we like to change things up everything

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,120
from floating Astros to multiple

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,460
variations of floating Astros and

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,960
animations we like to have fun I think

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,070
technology should be fun and when you

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,390
come to the website you should have a

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,710
good time and it should pique your

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,300
interest and you should be thinking

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,700
about how do they do that or what

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,410
technology was used or how does Astro

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,300
float in three different variations on a

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,000
mobile device we get a lot of questions

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,490
about stuff like that so this site now

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,720
becomes really more of a landing page it

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,460
becomes more of an all things open

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,460
universe sort of letting people know

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,560
everything that we do for so long we've

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,080
been doing a lot of other stuff other

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,460
events and other other things though if

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,410
you go to the website up to this point

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,140
you would only think of us or know us as

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,180
a conference organization putting on one

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,620
conference a year nothing wrong with

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,600
that we're grateful that you know us at

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,430
all but moving forward we would like to

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,920
let people know that are new to us and

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,320
sort of coming to us for you know for

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,880
the first time that we in fact do much

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,670
more than that so that's what this site

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,260
will become so again not a huge deal but

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,610
it does represent a change so we wanted

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,380
to let people know that from this point

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,580
on when you go to the site you're not

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,900
only going to learn about all things

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,940
open the conference but you're going to

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,140
learn more about what we do and some of

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,670
the other platforms and some of the

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,380
other things that we're launching so

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,660
just be aware you can see the spacewalk

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,000
event here we like the space theme

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,010
you'll always see us to do that I was

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,340
kind of obsessed with space when I was

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,020
little and my son 3 years old obsessed

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,850
with the moon and the planets he's

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,010
following in my footsteps I likes

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:53,720
science fiction I liked space so movie

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,670
that certainly impacted our decisions in

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,190
which direction we go with themes and

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,470
design and animation etc so it'll always

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,050
be kind of a space the reason we do that

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,970
is exploration new horizons always

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,580
looking at what's coming and thinking

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,320
about possibilities etc so that's that's

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,110
how that fits that's why you've always

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,770
seen kind of a space theme with what

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,660
we've done

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,840
so I'll show you this really really

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,090
quickly and then we will move very very

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,130
fast so even on this new website and

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,230
again we're this is in progress we're

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,600
working on this as we speak our team is

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,130
for sure but these are 3d animations you

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,110
can put your cursor over them

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,380
you can interact with them and we use a

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,519
lot of open-source technology on this we

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,920
use three Jas we use green sock

00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:42,259
animation platform we use view for some

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,540
of the scaffolding etc so we use a lot

00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:46,040
of open-source Tekken this stuff and in

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,569
the coming days in the coming weeks

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,759
we'll release a lot of the code and

00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:51,170
we'll also release some blog post and

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,699
we'll tell you exactly how we did it and

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,470
then we'll engage with you if you're

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:56,300
interested as to how you might be able

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,889
to do some of this yourself as well so

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,290
we think it's kind of neat again we like

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,880
to keep it fun and interactive and I

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,190
don't know playful is an overused term

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,649
but again technologies should be fun it

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,500
shouldn't be all you know frowns and and

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,600
and rainy days so anyway you can kind of

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,190
see a lot of what we do and again you

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,139
can come to the site interact this all

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,850
will change and in the future you can

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,529
get news will begin to release news

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,630
about what we're doing through all

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,639
things open again which is now more of a

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,470
universe type site encompassing

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,550
everything that we do and you can see

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,600
some of the things that we've already

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:31,009
posted are really a blog post describing

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,769
what we're doing in person here tonight

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:36,800
but also what we do seven steps that we

00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,750
take try to try to ensure diversity any

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,089
inclusion at our events just seven

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,490
things but we'll begin to go into more

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,620
depth about what we do a lot of people

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,569
ask us and I'll be the first to admit up

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,279
to this point we've been it hasn't been

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,930
intentionally secretive or anything like

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
that but it's just we've been so busy we

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,170
have such a small team we haven't

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,670
released a lot of this stuff so we're

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,829
going to begin talking about more of

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,420
this stuff publicly moving forward so

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:01,370
that is the site and where you can sort

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,019
of find that so that's again the new

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,199

spread the word because you know someone

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,829
coming to the site for the first time

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:14,750
expecting only to hear about the

00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,039
conference and things like that they are

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,089
going to be in for a bit of a surprise

00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:22,459
so you saw again all things open as well

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,789

the attendance at the event is grown we

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,280
tried to chart this out and we started

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,300
the event in 2013 and we hope to keep

00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,520

conference on sort of off on that foot

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,860
sets the tone it establishes the

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,420
narrative if you will that inclusion and

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,520
diversity matter making people feel

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,140
welcome it actually matters so much so

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,700
that we're willing to sort of put our

money where our mouth is so to speak and

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,910

love to have you submit a talk in 2019

we received about a thousand talks about

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,330
a thousand responses to the CFP we

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,820
featured two hundred two hundred and

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,540
fifty speakers so you know it's not in

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,300
part you know is it's not well we turned

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,310
down more see talks than we accepted

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,870
obviously but we try to change it up

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,640
every year and we're always looking for

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,710
a variety of talks so please whatever

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,000
you do don't think well I've only been

in the industry three years what do I

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,070
have to offer please don't think that at

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,470
all we feature introductory level talks

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,090
all the time and sometimes those are the

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,390
best talks that we feature and then in

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:46,000
the garner the most positive feedback so

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,860
please please don't feel that way at all

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,020

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,790
the first time ever it's gonna be on the

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,710
East Coast in Raleigh preceding our

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,910
event so more information coming soon

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,770
about that I think you'll really enjoy

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,540
it and it really is one of the best

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,750
events in technology period and

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:31,420
certainly an open source for sure

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,980
open source 101 how many people have

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,790
been to an open source 101 er I've heard

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:42,700
about it okay good we do this and you

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:45,220
know what so let me do this I'm going to

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,660
show you the website that is live that's

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,370
actually what the website looks like

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,780
and again we're actually recording this

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,190
so this is good

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,840
I would encourage you to go to the open

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,550
source 101 website we do these in the

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,270
spring they're an on-ramp into open

00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:01,200
source ATO has been I don't know defined

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:04,210
by some is a more advanced level event

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,340
which we know is not always the case we

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,410
have a 101 track and we feature a lot of

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,150
introductory level talks but I could see

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,400
how people would think that about four

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,620
years ago we decided we really wanted to

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,810
provide a day of on-ramp education and

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,670
open source if you've never contributed

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,110
or you never consumed if you don't know

00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,250
much about licensing or if you don't

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,160
know much about open source business

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,990
models as an example we try to take this

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,370
day to educate you more about that let

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,320
you know

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,000
really featuring world-class speakers to

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,220
sort of on-ramp you into the open source

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,960
space a lot of people think everybody

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,190
knows that everybody knows how to pull

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,500
down code and integrate it into an

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,070
existing code base and attach a license

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,720
or be you know understand licensing at a

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,920
minimum enough level that you're not

let's move to open source jobs this is

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,050
new how many people here have heard me

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,420
talk about open source jobs a few people

00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,130
so apologies to you for reiterating and

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,260
repeating what we've done this is in

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,750
beta but this is new and I would love to

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,270
get your participation we have found

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,370
that the majority of people that sponsor

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:12,220
our events come to us because they are

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,770
recruiting talent this will come as news

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,230
to no one here in person or listening or

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:20,380
watching recruiting talent is a May

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,200
your challenge in some cases it's an

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,309
obstacle to growth and expansion it's a

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,140
big deal

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,640
finding quality people is a big deal and

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,320
what we do at a lot of our events has

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,820
helped to put people together connect

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,890
people with skills and experience that

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,990
entities organizations that need them

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,730
and all we're doing here is just taking

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,070
that and we're trying to do that for the

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,230
other 350 days of the year that we're

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,910
not hosting events so please check out

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,340
open source jobs if you go there now

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,020
you'll see jobs posted by companies like

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,100
automatic the companies sort of behind

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,320
WordPress Amazon etc etc so if you want

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,850
to post a job please post a job on there

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,110
if you're looking for help and if you're

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,169
in the market or if you're looking for a

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,090
job by all means please go to the site

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:06,340
and check out what's available the site

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:10,929
itself this does bear stating the site

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,940
itself is different in that we really

00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,429
try to focus on not just the technology

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,410
but on the process as well this gets

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,780
back to what I said before folks in

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,450
open-source process matters how many of

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,549
you at your you know place of business

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,830
now if you're a startup or if you're a

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,540
student or if you're just getting into

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,730
the industry and you're at a code school

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,590
or if you've been in the industry for 20

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,290
years how many people here have a github

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,450
account how many people pull code down

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,250
how many people contribute code how many

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,280
people here would would consider

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,610
yourself well-versed and knowledgeable

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,549
in the area of open-source licensing

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:51,400
yeah yeah that's what I thought so

00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:54,309
everyone watching only a few hands went

00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,590
up yet open-source licensing kind of a

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,059
big deal kind of a big deal how many

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,580
people here work in an environment with

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,500
a governance policy a policy in place

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,900
that kind of establishes parameters as

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,120
to how open-source can be used in your

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,059
workplace etc how many people here have

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,740
one of those in place okay a few of you

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,120
good so that means the majority of you

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,360
do not how many people here have never

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,679
even heard of it I I know a lot more

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,600
haven't heard of it and you're not

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,160
raising your hands that's totally ok I

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,650
got to tell you these are the things

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,760
these is what I mean by process this

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,830
this is what I mean

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,720
in the open-source space in the modern

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,480
IT technology environment where

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,370
open source is used and utilized these

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,380
things are relevant they're pertinent

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,929
and they're extremely important so that

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,419
is what this site highlights as well the

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,610
fact that open source job means not just

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,980
the technology a programming language or

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,049
a platform or a database etc but it also

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,150
means processed knowledge and experience

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,789
as well so that's what's highlighted on

00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,650
this on this site and trust me when I

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:55,840
tell you that companies that are posting

00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,720
jobs they understand that if you talk to

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,150
a hiring manager and you ask them during

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,190
the interview process do you ask just

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,929
about technology or do you ask questions

00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,390
like the ones that I just posed to you

00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:09,220
well I will tell you some hiring

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,840
managers do not it's because they are

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,730
not aware of what I just stated so they

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,289
don't ask about it however I can tell

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,720
you that once you get the job or once

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,909
you proceed and elevate get to a

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,890
different phase of the interview process

00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:23,020
you will be asked about that and if you

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,700
can come back and you can respond or you

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,230
can point out that you do have open

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,760
source process experience that you do

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,320
have a basic understanding of Licensing

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,870
and governance policies and protocols

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,240
etc you will jump off the page and your

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,740
marketability will go up we've talked to

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,690
enough hiring managers to know that this

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,340
is a fact a lot of them don't ask about

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,860
it a lot of recruiters that you talk to

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,630
nothing about recruiters and nothing I

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,429
don't mean anything negative at all but

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,080
I doubt very many are asking about open

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,669
source process knowledge and expertise

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,650
we're trying to highlight that because

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:54,309
we feel like in our experience it's

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:56,470
extremely important so open source jobs

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,870
open source core all that process stuff

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,580
I just said all that stuff that I just

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,169
referenced we attempt to quantify this

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,320
how many people here have taken the

00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,940
survey cool a few of you have thank you

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,890
very much we really appreciate that if

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,610
you haven't go to open source score comm

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:14,950
and take a very quick survey for us what

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,679
we're trying to do with this it's an

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,299
straight up straight out it is an

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,490
educational tool in an educational

00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,620
platform we want you to take a survey we

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,289
want to qualify your knowledge when it

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,240
comes to open source process expertise

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,460
knowledge etc on things like I just

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,990
identify understanding of licenses

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,570
attending open source events

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,400
contributing code open sourcing and

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,390
internal tool or technology how many

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,890
people here have actually open source

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:43,900
something okay a few of you I can tell

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,790
that if there are best practices there

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,160
are right ways to do that if you're

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,320
working at a company now and you want to

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,179
recruit better talent or more talent and

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,350
you're having a tough time a lot of

00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,660
companies what they're doing is they're

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,880
open sourcing cool things that you're

00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,260
already doing internally well if someone

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,730
goes through the boss or the person in

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,350
charge or decisions are made

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,960
collectively and you say I have a great

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,120
idea from in the context of talent

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,730
recruitment and talent retention we use

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,299
this really great tool that helps us out

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,230
wonderfully it's very beneficial

00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,059
internally

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,650
let's open source that to let everyone

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,970
on the outside know what cool things

00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,880
they could work on if they came to work

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,260
here I can tell you that a long pause is

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,630
gonna follow because people are going to

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,270
look at each other like hmm boy that

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,630
sure sounds good well how do we do that

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,950
what do we do who who's the expert we

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,059
talk to somebody's done that before

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,830
because I don't want to incur any

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,510
liability and what license would we

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,919
attach to that and don't we have to have

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,080
a policy in place and who's gonna write

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,179
the technical documentation documenting

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,150
the logic etc who's gonna do that and if

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,950
the response is I couldn't take it I

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,210
don't know that's not gonna go very far

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,950
so we encourage you to learn more about

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,100
it but that's what open source score is

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:53,290
take the survey we encourage you to do

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,760
it and learn and access some of the

00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,169
educational resources some of the

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,470
educational links that are on that

00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:01,330
website try to do that for us here's the

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,940
other this is the final thing that I'll

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,040
say about score we've built in sort of a

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,049
gamification aspect to this as well we

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,640
want you to know how you score in

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,919
relation to everyone that's ever taken

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,809
the survey it's not a competitive thing

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,030
you don't have to share your score it's

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,169
not about that it's just we found it

00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,690
beneficial we thought it would deliver

00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:21,220
value to let you know how you stack up

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,320
against everybody that's ever taken it

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,710
where do I fall in relation oh I see I

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,780
got a 65 on a scale of 0 to 100 is that

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,250
good or bad or is that better than 80%

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,080
of the people that have taken it or is

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,340
that better than 20% of the people that

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,320
have taken it and I really need to know

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,760
more that is built in as well and you'll

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,370
see it on the open source core that's

00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,160
new we're in beta you'll find bugs trust

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,690
me we're making changes and updates and

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,820

any have some ideas as to how we could

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,280
do it better let us know for sure but

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:55,429

eight years under the ATO banner

00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:23,599
honestly has been testing a hypothesis

00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:26,869
and a theory can we do better ourselves

00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:30,529
can we survive and pay bills while

00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:32,589
helping other people you a surprising

00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:35,179
number of people do not believe that a

00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:37,519
surprising number of people think look

00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,379
go for it help yourself first you can't

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,019
take care of anyone else until you help

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:43,580
yourself first to a degree that's true

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,200
there's a lot of truth into that but

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,539
we've again this has been an eight-year

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,549
test of the belief that no no those two

00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,779
things can work together so that's what

00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,950
we've always been about and that's what

00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,950
