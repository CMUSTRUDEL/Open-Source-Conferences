00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:14,490
so what we believe look folks Tech

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,049
you're here for a reason technologies

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,560
importance and influence is only going

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,690
to grow

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,949
it's amazing the changes that I've seen

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,140
over the last twenty years since I've

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,779
been in the industry everything in

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,180
society literally everything is directly

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,500
impacted by tech dependent upon tech and

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,170
moving forward that's only going to be

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,360
the case more and more and more it

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,660
behooves you to be engaged and to

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,329
actually take part and to participate in

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,070
some way with that comes great promise I

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,290
think technology can make society better

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,360
for sure but I believe and we believe

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,550
collectively that with it also comes

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,910
great risk that is the topic for an

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,379
entire talk what is the risk of

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,420
technology becoming more influential in

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,610
society in general I think there are a

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,170
lot of risks and I think those are very

00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,590
real so you need to be aware of that as

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,030
well

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,699
but we do need to get everyone involved

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,589
if technology is impacting everyone and

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,110
if everyone's consuming technology we

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,970
want everyone to be aware of it to be

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,040
involved in it to participate and begin

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,530
to have that seat at the table we think

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,720
it's vital so access really does matter

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,979
segues nicely into access we really

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,280
truly try to make everything we do

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,990
accessible we want you to be able to

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,150
attend our events we always find a way

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,400
for those of you watching or for those

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,530
of you here if you ever want to attend

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,360
one of our events and you cannot make it

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,250
happen for whatever reason financially

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,509
or otherwise please let us know we'll

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,890
work with you to make arrangements to

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,570
make sure you get access to what we do

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,500
we think it's extremely important that

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,170
you're at the table and you're

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,759
participating inclusion matters once

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,250
someone has overcome a barrier to entry

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,140
then making people feel welcome it

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,340
matters you're never going to get the

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,320
best from someone you're never going to

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,630
get their great ideas if they don't feel

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,159
welcome we honestly try to make that the

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,869
case that everything that we do we

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,490
always have from the very beginning not

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,290
always done a perfect job or the best

00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,430
job but we've done the best job that we

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,409
can we'd like to think that we're

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,180
getting better inclusion really matters

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,369
and it's extremely extremely important

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,129
and finally kindness and respect matter

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,560
if I could show you in past talks I

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,720
always end with pictures

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,640
from the house in which I was raised and

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,319
my mom doesn't even know I do this but

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,630
they're images when I go back to my

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,640
parents house to this day my mom has

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,830
signs around our house as a reminder

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,630
that kindness and respect matters and

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,220
there are a variety of maybe three or

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,770
four of them but it's seemingly around

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,300
every Bend you see one and I have really

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,130
come to appreciate that when I was very

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,770
very young it was like uh golly

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,590
okay tell me again tell me again again

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,000
are you kidding me however now twenty

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,100
years thirty years down the road I'm

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,260
extremely thankful for that it matters

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,720
folks you all know that I know but it

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,980
does bear repeating in result of

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,980
