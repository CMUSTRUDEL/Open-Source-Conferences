encourage people to get into the tech

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,570
field and I hope that this community

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,520
provides a really good support system

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,649
for you to ask all the questions you

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,960
want regardless of skill level and

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,879
you're always always welcome yeah and

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,449
you're also an accessibility specialist

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,760
thank you you've actually spoken and our

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,770
meetup about accessibility as well and

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,020
and at our conferences we think it's a

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,490
pretty important topic yeah yeah so my

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,340
background I'm a board-certified

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,070
assistant behavior analyst so before I

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,030
switched into tech I spent eight years

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,110
providing to hear real therapy for

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,900
people with developmental disabilities

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,049
and when I switched into tech on web

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,090
accessibility was just my passion yeah

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,189
what can you use how can people here

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,439
help you out um well so we're always

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,960
looking for sponsors but most of all I

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,540
would say we're looking for helpers we

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,310
have a lot of big events coming up and

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,770
we're specifically looking for people

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,100

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,060
inspiring the youth to get into the tech

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,659
