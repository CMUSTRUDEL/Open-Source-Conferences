00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,930
the site itself is different in that we

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,270
really try to focus on not just the

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,610
technology but on the process as well

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,830
this gets back to what I said before

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,470
folks in open-source process matters how

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,720
many of you at your you know place of

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,640
business now if you're a startup or if

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,200
you're a student or if you're just

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,570
getting into the industry and you're at

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,429
a code school or if you've been in the

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,440
industry for 20 years how many people

00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:40,329
here have a github account how many

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,309
people pull code down how many people

00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,670
contribute code how many people here

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,929
would would consider yourself

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,579
well-versed and knowledgeable in the

00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:53,469
area of open-source licensing yeah yeah

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,559
that's what I thought so everyone

00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:59,260
watching only a few hands went up he had

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,300
open source licensing kind of a big deal

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,530
kind of a big deal how many people here

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,019
working in environment with the

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,180
governance policy a policy in place that

00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,250
kind of establishes parameters as to how

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,650
open-source can be used in your

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,380
workplace etc how many people here have

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,090
one of those in place okay a few of you

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,470
good so that means the majority of you

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,680
do not how many people here have never

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,120
even heard of it I I know a lot more

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,920
haven't heard of it and you're not

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,780
raising your hands that's totally okay I

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,940
got to tell you these are the things

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,980
these is what I mean by process this

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,290
this is what I mean in the open source

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,480
space in the modern IT technology

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,880
environment where I open source is used

00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,410
and utilized these things are relevant

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,690
they're pertinent and they're extremely

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,030
important so that is what this site

00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,550
highlights as well the fact that open

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,560
source job means not just the technology

00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,290
a programming language or a platform or

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,240
a database etc but it also means process

00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,890
knowledge and experience as well so

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,580
