00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,769
so why do we do what we do I don't want

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,480
to get to cliches here and those of you

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,770
that have heard me say this before you

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,619
know where I'm going with this already

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,080
but really there is kind of a rhyme and

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,180
a reason there's an approach there's a

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,519
reason why we do what we do and and and

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,849
in the way that we do it there's still

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,980
no substitute for face-to-face as remote

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,079
communication has become easier it's

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,800
become more convenient

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,059
we still think anything that has

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,920
increased or heightened the importance

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,780
of face-to-face communication there

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,289
simply is no substitute for getting to

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,750
know someone in person I can tell you

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,719
that I always encourage anyone that

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,899
asked me yes certainly a cold

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,430
introductory email is fine or someone

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,030
making an introduction on your behalf

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,430
via email or the digital platform is

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,710
great but do whatever you can do to meet

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,450
them meet that person in person face to

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,400
face go to a conference find out where

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,689
they're speaking asked for a meeting ask

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
for coffee there's just no substitute

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,970
and I can't overemphasize that in person

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,369
and at conferences

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,040
it's where decisions and deals are made

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,600
things get done in person things get

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,900
done in events that's what's really

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,729
going on in many cases whether the you

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,400
know kind of on the surface of sensibly

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,500
speaking you realize it or not

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,380
introductions are made new technologies

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,990
introduced and it's discussed and it's

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,329
talked about etc and Vanessa is where

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,189
education happens as well so we were big

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,290
believers in conferences and events and

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,540
meetups just like this and in person

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,780
in-person events because that's where

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,920
things happen we view it live events as

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,630
gateways actually gateways or and you

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,610
know really the way that it's phrased

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,430
behind me here on the screen is we view

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,369
it as a seat at the table I was advised

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,680
very very early on by people very close

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,030
to me told me this and at the time they

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,860
told me I had no idea what they were

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,899
talking about but they told me Todd

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,470
either you're at the table or you're on

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,470
the menu

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:23,040
how many people have been told that okay

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,720
if all of you that raised your hands the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
person that told you that really cared

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,709
about you they were telling you that to

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,569
tell you the way the world works you're

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,189
either at the table or you're generally

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,870
on the menu it doesn't mean people are

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,950
out to devour you or to destroy you

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,650
that's not what I'm saying

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,180
is all it means is that a very high

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,769
level is that if you're not at the table

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,989
you're not engaging in conversations

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,220
involved in decisions involved in a lot

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,099
of the new tech and a lot of the new

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,090
groups and organizations that are formed

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,769
you're then going to be very reactive

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,840
you're going to be responding to things

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,670
that people do not a good position to be

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,329
in in my opinion and in our opinion

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,329
