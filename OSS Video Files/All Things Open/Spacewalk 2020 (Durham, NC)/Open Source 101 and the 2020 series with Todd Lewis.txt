00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,880
open source 101 how many people have

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,720
been to an open source 101 or have heard

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:24,570
about it okay good we do this and you

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:27,180
know what so let me do this I'm gonna

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,769
show you the website that is live that's

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,269
actually what the website looks like

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,610
and again we're actually recording this

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,350
so this is good I would encourage you to

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,940
go to the open source 101 website we do

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,719
these in the spring they're an on-ramp

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,120
into open source ato has been I don't

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,390
know defined by some is a more advanced

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,399
level event which we know is not always

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,110
the case we have a 101 track and we

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,820
feature a lot of introductory level

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,190
talks but I could see how people would

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,750
think that about four years ago we

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,969
decided we really wanted to provide a

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,129
day of on-ramp education and open source

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,780
if you've never contributed or you never

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,280
consumed if you don't know much about

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,350
licensing or if you don't know much

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,360
about open source business models as an

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,299
example we try to take this day to

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,250
educate you more about that let you know

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,900
really featuring world-class speakers to

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,150
sort of on-ramp you into the open source

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,890
space a lot of people think everybody

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,180
knows that everybody knows how to pull

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,430
down code and integrate it into an

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,970
existing code base and attach a license

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,650
or be you know understand licensing at a

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,820
minimum enough level that you're not

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,400
going to get yourself in trouble or

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,009
incur liability I can tell you that is

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,590
not the case we learn new stuff every

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,119
day we do not know there is so much we

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,979
don't know and I know it's the case for

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,290
the general public as well so by all

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,540
