00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,429
open-source core all that process stuff

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,139
I just said all that stuff that I just

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,730
referenced we attempt to quantify this

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,880
how many people here have taken the

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,500
survey cool a few of you have thank you

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,449
very much we really appreciate that if

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,199
you haven't go to open-source core calm

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,480
and take a very quick survey for us what

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,270
we're trying to do with this it's a

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,860
straight up straight out it is an

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,050
educational tool in an educational

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,210
platform we want you to take a survey we

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,879
want to qualify your knowledge when it

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,829
comes to open source process expertise

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,020
knowledge etc on things like I just

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,579
identify understanding of licenses

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,100
attending open source events

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,989
contributing code open sourcing and

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,949
internal tool or technology how many

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,539
people here have actually open source

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,460
something ok a few of you I can tell you

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,350
that if there are best practices there

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,750
are right ways to do that if you're

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,820
working at a company now and you want to

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,830
recruit better talent or more talent and

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,909
you're having a tough time a lot of

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,220
companies what they're doing is they're

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,439
open sourcing cool things that you're

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,820
already doing internally well if someone

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,290
goes through the boss or the person in

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,970
charge or decisions are made

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,520
collectively and you say I have a great

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,680
idea from in the context of talent

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,290
recruitment and talent retention we use

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,860
this really great tool that helps us out

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,380
wonderfully it's very beneficial

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,939
internally let's open source that to let

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,259
everyone on the outside know what cool

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,600
things they could work on if they came

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,610
to work here I can tell you that a long

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,079
pause is going to follow because people

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,140
are going to look at each other like hmm

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,350
well that sure sounds good well how do

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,149
we do that what do we do who who's the

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,619
expert we talk to somebody has done that

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,420
before because I don't want to incur any

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,070
liability and what license would we

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,479
attach to that and don't we have to have

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,640
a policy in place and who's gonna write

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,680
the technical documentation documenting

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,710
the logic etc who's going to do that and

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
if the response is I couldn't take it I

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,649
don't know that's not going to go very

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,060
far so we encourage you to learn more

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,360
about it but that's what open-source

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,759
score is take the survey we encourage

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,349
you to do it and learn and access some

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,730
of the educational resources some of the

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,330
educational links that are on that

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,210
website

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,920
try to do that for us here's the other

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,530
this is a final thing that I'll say

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,600
about score we've built in sort of a

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,610
gamification aspect to this as well we

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,230
want you to know how you score in

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,480
relation to everyone that's ever taken

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,400
the survey it's not a competitive thing

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,590
you don't have to share your score it's

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,730
not about that it's just we found it

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,100
beneficial we thought it would deliver

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,780
value to let you know how you stack up

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,880
against everybody that's ever taken it

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,270
where do I fall in relation oh I see I

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,340
got a 65 on a scale of 0 to 100 is that

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,840
good or bad or is that better than 80%

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,640
of the people that have taken it or is

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,900
that better than 20% of the people that

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,880
have taken it and I really need to know

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,350
more that is built in as well and you'll

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,930
see it on an open source score that's

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,720
new we're in beta you'll find bugs trust

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,250
me we're making changes and updates and

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,410
and and you know we're seeking

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,700
contribution so if if you take a look at

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,070
and you have some ideas as to how we can

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,840
do it better let us know for sure but

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,500
please be on the lookout for open-source

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,500
