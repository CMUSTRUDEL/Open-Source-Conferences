00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,990
civic hacking like like like hacking

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,560
government - yeah hacking in the in the

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,359
good sense as it I think somebody needs

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,660
to build a government that works I'd be

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,130
that'd be a really nice nice change of

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,439
pace

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,010
you know thank you I'm here all week

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,280
don't forget to tip your waitress yeah I

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,840
I would like to I mean you know that and

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,809
this is this is one of the other themes

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,539
that was not in the original action that

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,690
we added in this addition was to try to

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,860
convey some sense of our responsibility

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,610
in this mess because the world does run

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,670
on our software and when we forget to

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,410
check some air condition or you know we

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,670
just program that happy path and hey

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,790
ship it or agile you know there's

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,200
serious repercussions you know you know

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,110
the fact that Twitter can be used to

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,210
take down government's that was really

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,290
cool when it was somebody else's right

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,540
but yeah we there's a lot of

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,280
responsibility for that all these

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,259
articles about the insecurity of the

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,210
voting machines I mean that's just

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,759
appalling you know they've got these

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,700
these closed-source things with wide

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,170
open bugs known vulnerabilities sitting

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,619
there without passwords on the open

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,829
Internet that strikes me as a remarkably

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,420
poor idea and we can do better and know

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,750
it doesn't take blockchain but that's

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,750
