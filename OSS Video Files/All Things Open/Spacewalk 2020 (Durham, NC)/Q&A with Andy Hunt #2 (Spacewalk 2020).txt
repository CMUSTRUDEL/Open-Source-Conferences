00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:35,520
who's got the next question that's a

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,500
it's a tough question and I think my

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
answer to that will have changed over

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,140
the years so so the question was you

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,930
know how do you evaluate or justify what

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,300
tech you bring into a project and

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,379
there's a lot of factors that play into

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,390
that certainly we want to use the shiny

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:57,600
because it's fun and you know we want to

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,670
do that but it depends on the use case

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,059
you know in a lot of a lot of cases

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,189
especially if it's a smaller mom-and-pop

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,799
shop or a smaller organization you want

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,750
old boring tech you want something that

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,640
you can plop there and it will just work

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,680
and nobody has to keep up with the

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,299
latest you know third decimal point

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,020
point release to make the bloody thing

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,670
work and you know that's fine there's

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,830
other instances where you need to be

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,659
literally on the bleeding edge because

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,580
you have to get that last ounce of

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,600
performance or that you know whatever it

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,299
might be

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
so that's the kind of thing where I

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,000
think you need to look at kind of a

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,520
snapshot okay what's what's the context

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,259
now you know what what is the user where

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,880
does the customer actually need what's

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,490
the best tool for the job that'll do

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,860
that now but then look at that over time

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,509
are they gonna have to maintain this how

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,180
hard is it going to be to get talent

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,460
that knows that technology how hard is

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,439
it going to be to maintain that how hard

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,360
is it gonna be to deploy that you know

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,890
whether it's you know on containers now

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,530
or this or that or you know how is this

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,420
going to evolve over time and is this

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,170
the best choice that's going to match

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,569
that that flow that's the real question

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,770
because I think one of the traps we fall

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:15,570
into a lot is if we even bother

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,520
look at all these influences and all the

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,880
context we take a snapshot of right now

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,950
and that's great what about a month from

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,660
now what about next year what about five

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,120
years from now what's gonna happen with

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,490
that if I had a nickel for every time a

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,340
developer decided to go slog some log

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,750
entries off to a database file and never

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,220
clean them out and then five ten years

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,520
later some old piece of code is there

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,710
just horking over what is this nitrite

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,200
so you know little things like that and

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,000
that's kind of an extreme example but we

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,000
do things like that without considering

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,640
what happens to this in ten years twenty

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,260
years right because I think we

00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,270
subconsciously think this isn't gonna be

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,570
running still by then he'll be replaced

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,060
long by then not always

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,090
I literally have some some bash shell

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,540
scripts that are in excess of 30 years

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,960
old that still run I still use somebody

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,030
still using them hey thanks for joining

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,670
us

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,459
so yeah you got it I would say look at

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,780
the axis of time in addition to to

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,709
everything else for fitness and

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,709
