00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,130
so the white what do we do you're here

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,049
so you know what we do we host events

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,150
and we've hosted technology events for a

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,310
long period of time we're now hosting a

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,010
few new platforms that will host a

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,630
number of platforms moving forward so

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,390
not only can you engage with us in

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,529
person at live events but you're soon

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,449
going to be able to engage with us

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,239
online in other ways as well we've been

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,040
doing this since 2008 under the name all

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,410
things open I've been doing this for

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,940
probably five years prior to that we've

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,100
done it under a variety of names we've

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,510
hosted other events it's all been open

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
source open tech in the open web

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,190
everything we do is focused on that

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,960
space we think that it's a gateway to

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,010
opportunity if you look around it's

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,340
where all the innovation the creativity

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,079
the tech space is really coming from we

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,329
think wisdom of the crowds works the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,980
collaborative model works and to us it's

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,539
extremely exciting so that's why we

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,829
happen to focus on that particular area

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,049
there are other reasons too which I'll

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,270
touch on in just a minute we focus on

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,880
technology frameworks programming

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,860
languages that's great I love it you you

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,510
like it most of you here that's that's

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,509
actually why you're here but we also

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,009
focus on processes we happen to think

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,439
it's extremely important that in

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,450
addition to the technology processes are

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,700
really in some cases just as important

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,549
and maybe even in other instances even

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,439
more important so we focus on processes

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,299
as well and I'll describe what I'm

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,430
talking about in just a second and we

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,110
also focus on established and also

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,909
emerging technologies as well so if you

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,860
come to our events you're gonna get some

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,820
information to some content about things

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,350
that you already know about that have

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,509
been around a while but we're also gonna

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,920
hit on some newer things on the horizon

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,750
we feel like it's our responsibility

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,850
let's you know sort of what's coming and

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,689
also introduce you to some new speakers

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,520
as well

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,590
some of our speakers are established

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,780
veterans but honestly a lot of them are

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,340
people that are really doing something

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,600
creative and new and they're newer on

00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,700
the scene maybe they've only been in the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,590
industry for a year or two five years

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,049
eight years etc but we want to introduce

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,820
them to you we want them to be the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,950
superstars of tomorrow we want them to

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,050
be the keynote speakers five years from

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,580
now and if we can play some small role

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,120
in that process that makes this to a

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,120
