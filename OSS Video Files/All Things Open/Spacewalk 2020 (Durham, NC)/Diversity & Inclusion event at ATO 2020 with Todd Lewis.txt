00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,870
the diversity and inclusion event we've

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,519
done that now this will be our third

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,400
year we're gonna do it again on the 18th

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,990
on Sunday last year we had almost 600

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,240
people there from all over the world if

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,949
you haven't attended that please please

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,500
check that out it is a great event we

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,779
feel like starting the conference on

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,599
sort of off on that foot sets the tone

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,070
it establishes the narrative if you will

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,719
that inclusion and diversity matter

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,730
making people feel welcome it actually

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,469
matters so much so that we're willing to

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,120
sort of put our money where our mouth is

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,129
so to speak and do a separate event

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,440
which is an unbelievable event it's been

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,550
really really good and all of you that

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,500
have attended I hope you've had a good

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,000
time if you have any input on how we can

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,649
improve the event by all means please

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,850
