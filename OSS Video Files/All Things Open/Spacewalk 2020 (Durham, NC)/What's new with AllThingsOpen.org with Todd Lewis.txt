00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,750
let's let's get to a few of the changes

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,920
so for the last 78 years everybody that

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,990
has attended the conference I know you

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,939
visited the website because you had to

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,470
register and you had to be registered

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,260
before you came on site and visited with

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,330
us every October so the website is

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,580
changing I do want to let you know that

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,900
so if you haven't checked it out yet I

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,820
would encourage you to do that last

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,890
seven to eight years it's only focused

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,469
on the conference it's only been the

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,770
conference you do come there maybe

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,719
August September June November

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,770
you know October etc leading up to the

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,260
event to register to get more

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,850
information from this point forward it's

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,469
going to include more information it's

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,610
going to change just a little bit and

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,949
I'm gonna walk over here I'm going to

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,190
show you how you're already looking at a

00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:02,820
screenshot but so give me just a minute

00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,739
so this is just what the new site will

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,939
look like this will take on many many

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,260
different iterations if you know

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,030
anything about us we like to change

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,040
things up everything from floating

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,170
Astros to multiple variations of

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,240
floating Astros and animations we like

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,619
to have fun I think technology should be

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,000
fun when you come to the website you

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,170
should have a good time and it should

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
pique your interest and you should be

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,130
thinking about how do they do that or

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,570
what technology was used or how does

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,520
Astro float in three different

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,259
variations on a mobile device we get a

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,200
lot of questions about stuff like that

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,060
so this site now becomes really more of

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,950
a landing page it becomes more of an all

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,740
things open universe sort of letting

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,270
people know everything that we do for so

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,790
long we've been doing a lot of other

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,860
stuff other events and other other

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,420
things but if you go to the website up

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,970
to this point you would only think of us

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,520
or know us as a conference organization

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,049
putting on one conference a year nothing

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,060
wrong with that we're grateful that you

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,530
know us at all but moving forward we

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,450
would like to let people know that are

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,540
new to us and sort of coming to us for

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,040
you know for the first time that we in

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,200
fact do much more than that so that's

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,299
what this site will become so again not

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,560
a huge deal but it does represent a

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,060
change so we wanted to let people know

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,830
that from this point on when you go to

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,380
the site you're not only going to learn

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,730
about all

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,830
open the conference but you're going to

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,970
learn more about what we do and some of

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,050
the other platforms and some of the

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,050
