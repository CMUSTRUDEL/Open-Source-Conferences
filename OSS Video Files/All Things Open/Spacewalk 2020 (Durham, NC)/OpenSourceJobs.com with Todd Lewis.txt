00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,009
let's move to open source jobs this is

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,010
new how many people here have heard me

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,410
talk about open source jobs a few people

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,119
so apologies to you for reiterating or

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,100
repeating what we've done this is in

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,740
beta but this is new and I would love to

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,260
get your participation we have found

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,359
that the majority of people that sponsor

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,210
our events come to us because they are

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,730
recruiting talent this will come as news

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,510
to no one here in person or listening or

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,730
watching recruiting talent is a major

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,910
challenge in some cases it's an obstacle

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,129
to growth and expansion it's a big deal

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,629
finding quality people is a big deal and

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,309
what we do at a lot of our events has

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,809
helped to put people together connect

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,879
people with skills and experience that

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,980
entities organizations that need them

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,719
and all we're doing here is just taking

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,030
that and we're trying to do that for the

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,219
other 350 days of the year that we're

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,870
not hosting events so please check out

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,299
open source jobs if you go there now

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,010
you'll see jobs posted by companies like

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,090
automatic the companies sort of behind

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,280
WordPress Amazon etc etc so if you want

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,810
to post a job please post a job on there

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,100
if you're looking for help and if you're

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,159
in the market or if you're looking for a

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,080
job by all means please go to the site

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,299
and check out what's available the site

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,920
itself this does bear stating the site

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,200
itself is different in that we really

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,420
try to focus on not just the technology

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,400
but on the process as well this gets

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,770
back to what I said before folks in

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
open-source process matters how many of

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,540
you at your you know place of business

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
now if you're a startup or if you're a

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,530
student or if you're just getting into

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,720
the industry and you're at a code school

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,579
or if you've been in the industry for 20

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,250
years how many people here have a github

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,439
account how many people pull code down

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,270
how many people contribute code how many

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,270
people here would would consider

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,600
yourself well-versed and knowledgeable

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,539
in the area of open source licensing

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,390
yeah yeah that's what I thought so

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,920
everyone watching only a few hands went

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,620
up he had open source

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,360
licencing kind of a big deal kind of a

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,459
big deal how many people here work in an

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,590
environment with the governance policy a

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,750
policy in place that kind of establishes

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,459
parameters as to how open-source can be

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,560
used in your workplace

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,319
it's cedra how many people here have one

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,030
of those in place okay a few of you good

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,380
so that means the majority of you do not

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,680
how many people here have never even

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,090
heard of it I I know a lot more haven't

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,160
heard of it and you're not raising your

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,349
hands that's totally okay I got to tell

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,569
you these are the things these is what I

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,819
mean by process this this is what I mean

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,459
in the open source space in the modern

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,980
IT technology environment where I open

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,480
source is used and utilized these things

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,519
are relevant they're pertinent and

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,920
they're extremely important so that is

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,380
what this site highlights as well the

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,630
fact that open source job means not just

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,970
the technology programming language or a

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,010
platform or a database etc but it also

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,110
means processed knowledge and experience

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,750
as well so that's what's highlighted on

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,640
this on this site and trust me when I

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,830
tell you that companies that are posting

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,769
jobs they understand that if you talk to

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,140
a hiring manager and you ask them during

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,180
the interview process do you ask just

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,920
about technology or do you ask questions

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,290
like the ones that I just posed to you

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,090
well I will tell you some hiring

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,799
managers do not it's because they are

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,720
not aware of what I just stated so they

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,280
don't ask about it however I can tell

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,709
you that once you get the job or once

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,239
you proceed and elevate get to a

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,880
different phase of the interview process

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,010
you will be asked about that and if you

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,570
can come back and you can respond or you

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,220
can point out that you do have open

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,750
source process experience that you do

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,310
have a basic understanding of Licensing

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,829
and governance policies and protocols

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,200
etc you will jump off the page and your

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,730
marketability will go up we've talked to

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,680
enough hiring managers to know that this

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,329
is a fact a lot of them don't ask about

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,850
it a lot of recruiters that you talk to

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,590
nothing about recruiters and nothing I

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,420
don't mean anything negative at all but

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,069
I doubt very many are asking about open

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,660
source processed knowledge and expertise

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,639
we're trying to highlight that because

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,540
we feel like in our experience it's

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,540
