00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,960
folks I asked before how many people

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,210
here have read pragmatic programmer

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,439
owned a copy have been influenced by the

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,930
book large number of you said yes a

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,460
number of you said no so I think this is

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,859
a good opportunity for those that have

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,570
been influenced and are familiar it kind

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,980
of maybe gets the backstory maybe have

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,469
some of the gaps filled in here from

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,450
Andy directly and then also for those of

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,280
you not familiar you'll understand why

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,800
we feel like it's the most influential

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,079
book maybe in the history of Technology

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
when it comes to programmers and by the

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,379
way I would say this if Andy weren't

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,690
standing right here I would a hundred

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,489
percent say that and that's merely based

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,770
on feedback from our community over a

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,480
lot a lot of years so Andy you did a

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,829
great job with the book thank you very

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
much for being here tonight thanks for

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,100
agreeing to sign books and speak to

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,989
people afterwards and for those of you

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,609
by all means I want you to stick around

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,860
we're gonna do about forty forty-five

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,540
minutes of talk and then QA and then

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,979
we'll wrap things up and then we'll go

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,520
right outside we'll have books sitting

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,530
out 50 of them will be available hard

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,060
hardcover so they're very very nice but

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,100
they'll be available on a first-come
