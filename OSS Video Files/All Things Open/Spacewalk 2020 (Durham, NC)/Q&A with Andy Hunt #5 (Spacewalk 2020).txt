00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:20,100
don't do it they have one of the

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,289
interviewees earlier said that there was

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,910
a problem with with women dropping out

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,010
of tech at the 10-year mark it's like

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:33,980
yeah cuz they realized what they'd

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:33,980
gotten into and bolted the biggest thing

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,070
well it's a pit it depends on what axis

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,230
so I think the most important skill you

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,920
need the most important skill you need

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,649
to develop is being able to unlearn

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,910
quickly now most people say well you

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,250
need to be able to learn quickly yes

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,320
certainly of course but in order to do

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,829
that you've got to be able to unlearn

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,660
quickly so you know they took and they

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,670
even told me this when I was in college

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,700
back in we had you know stone tablets

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,229
and and stuff like that they said you

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,299
know really whatever we whatever

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,130
technology we teach you in college

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,229
you will not use out in the workplace

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,780
it'll it'll be dead by then

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,460
it'll be on to something else and yes

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,939
indeed so I spent two years programming

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,590
on modulo - what whoo yeah I never heard

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,150
of it yeah that happens so you know

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,220
there are folks who are like oh I've

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,840
gone to a coding boot camp and I've

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,900
learned this you know part of this one

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,560
language I'm all set I'm done mmm

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,290
not even close right the the trick the

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,850
neck is to learn something learn the

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,470
next thing learn something very

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,350
different from that so say you've

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,149
learned a Python or Ruby as a beginning

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,240
programming language good start

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,399
awesome good place to go then learn a

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,020
functional programming language take a

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,590
look at something really wacky like

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,790
Prolog or sequel everyone needs to know

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,530
SQL at some point right you know look at

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,770
all these different aspects of a thing

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,110
and you start to understand kind of the

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,390
the more fundamental basics of like

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,920
information theory so then when someone

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,110
comes up and tries to explain them

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,510
to you it's like yeah okay it's one of

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,080
these kind of things fine or whatever it

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:25,140
might be but the key is you can't hang

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,730
on to the thing you learned first or the

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,800
first several things that you learned

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,670
you know when when C++ came out back in

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,090
the day and it's like hey it's

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,550
object-oriented if you squint people

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,650
still wrote C code in C++

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,090
it was procedural it was linear and the

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,069
same thing happens today it's okay I've

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,420
learned Ruby I got real objects this is

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,100
great now I'm gonna program a lick sir

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,989
and they're not writing it in functional

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,050
style they're writing it in object style

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,950
and you know trying to shoehorn it in

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,110
because it's very difficult to throw out

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,600
the mental models that you've developed

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,160
the the learnings that you've had this

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,330
is the way you do it and now you're

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,610
telling me I've got to do it completely

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,709
differently

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,150
okay that's valuable to learn and then

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,459
do it completely differently again with

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,760
some other paradigm some other style and

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,790
you just keep doing that then you start

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,350
to get that appreciation of all the

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,790
little bits that no one can teach you

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,709
that that intellectual dark matter

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,799
that's kind of binding us all together

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,650
it's like oh I know what Andy was

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,989
talking about now so that's what I would

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,110
suggest great question thanks for asking

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,110
