00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,920
this year but we do look forward to

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,450

20th you can see how the attendance at

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,170
the event is grown we tried to chart

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,230
this out and we started the event in

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,860
2013 and we hope to keep that that

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,200
upward trajectory moving forward and

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,420
continuing we'd like to at least host

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,920
5,000 people this year and we hope you

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,059
all of you that have been at the event

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,680
we really hope that you've enjoyed it

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,670
and had a good time and by all means

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,320
please help us spread the word again the

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,579
diversity and inclusion event we've done

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,019
that now this will be our third year

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,869
we're going to do it again on the 18th

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,460
on Sunday last year we had almost 600

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,740
people there from all over the world if

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,450
you haven't attended that please please

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,000
check that out it is a great event we

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,250
feel like starting the conference on

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,100
sort of off on that foot sets the tone

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,540
it establishes the narrative if you will

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,189
that inclusion and diversity matter

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,229
making people feel welcome it actually

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,970
matters so much so that we're willing to

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,380
sort of put our money where our mouth is

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,509
so to speak and do a separate event

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,909

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,049

have attended I hope you've had a good

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,530
time if you have any input on how we can

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,270

feature introductory level talks all the

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,920
time and sometimes those are the best

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,390
talks that we feature and then in the

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,000
garner the most positive feedback so

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,860
