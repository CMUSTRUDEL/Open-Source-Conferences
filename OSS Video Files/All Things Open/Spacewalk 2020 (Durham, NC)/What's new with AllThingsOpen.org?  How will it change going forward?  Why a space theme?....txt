00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,670
with all that said all things open let's

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,340
let's get to a few of the changes so for

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,420
the last 78 years everybody that has

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,460
attended the conference I know you

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,410
visited the website because you had to

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,970
register and you had to be registered

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,730
before you came on site and visited with

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,010
us every October so the website is

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,050
changing I do want to let you know that

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,879
so if you haven't checked it out yet I

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,500
would encourage you to do that last 78

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,840
years it's only focused on the

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,870
conference it's only been the conference

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
you come there maybe August September

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,190
June November

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,239
you know October etc leading up to the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,730
event to register to get more

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,320
information from this point forward it's

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,940
going to include more information it's

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,050
going to change just a little bit and

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,449
I'm going to walk over here I'm going to

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,659
show you how you're already looking at a

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:10,320
screenshot but so give me just a minute

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,210
so this is just what the new site will

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,409
look like this will take on many many

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,700
different iterations if you know

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,500
anything about us we like to change

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,570
things up everything from floating

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,640
Astros to multiple variations of

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,650
floating Astros and animations we like

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,090
to have fun I think technology should be

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,500
fun and when you come to the website you

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,640
should have a good time and it should

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,470
pique your interest and you should be

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,600
thinking about how do they do that or

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,860
what technology was used or how does

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,990
Astro float in three different

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,549
variations on a mobile device we get a

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,670
lot of questions about stuff like that

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,560
so this site now becomes really more of

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,420
a landing page it becomes more of an all

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,210
things open universe sort of letting

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,740
people know everything that we do for so

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,259
long we've been doing a lot of other

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,329
stuff other events and other other

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,890
things but if you go to the website up

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,439
to this point you would only think of us

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,140
or know us as a conference organization

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
putting on one conference a year nothing

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,530
wrong with that we're grateful that you

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,000
know us at all but moving forward we

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,920
would like to let people know that are

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,009
new to us and sort of coming to us for

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,509
you know for the first time that we in

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,670
fact do much more than that so that's

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,140
what this site will become so again not

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,610
a huge deal but it

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,080
does represent a change so we wanted to

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,910
let people know that from this point on

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,290
when you go to the site you're not only

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,310
going to learn about all things open the

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,380
conference but you're going to learn

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,580
more about what we do and some of the

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,410
other platforms and some of the other

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,000
things that we're launching so just be

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,310
aware you can see the spacewalk event

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,709
here we like the space theme you'll

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,660
always see us to do that I was kind of

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,780
obsessed with space when I was little

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,670
and my son three years old obsessed with

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,430
the moon and the planets he's following

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,320
in my footsteps I likes science fiction

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,910
I liked space so that certainly impacted

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,970
our decisions in which direction we go

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,310
with themes and design and animation etc

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,380
so it'll always be kind of a space the

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,239
reason we do that is exploration new

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,510
horizons always looking at what's coming

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,160
and thinking about possibilities etc so

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,620
that's that's how that fits that's why

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,350
you've always seen kind of a space theme

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,300
with what we've done so I'll show you

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,660
this really really quickly and then we

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,760
will move very very fast so even on this

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,470
new website and again we're this is in

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,780
progress we're working on this as we

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,670
speak our team is for sure but these are

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,769
3d animations you can put your cursor

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,130
over them you can interact with them and

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:29,840
we use a lot of open-source technology

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,239
on this we use 3GS we use green sock

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,519
animation platform we use view for some

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,209
of the scaffolding etc so we use a lot

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,430
of open-source

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,200
Tekin this stuff and in the coming days

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,299
in the coming weeks we'll release a lot

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,980
of the code and we'll also release some

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,720
blog post and we'll tell you exactly how

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,519
we did it and then we'll engage with you

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,930
if you're interested as to how you might

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,940
be able to do some of this yourself as

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,590
well so we think it's kind of neat again

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,110
we like to keep it fun and interactive

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,390
and I don't know playful is an overused

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,200
term but again technology should be fun

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,810
it shouldn't be all you know frowns and

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,910
and rainy days so anyway you can kind of

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,500
see a lot of what we do and again you

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,390
can come to the site interact this all

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,160
will change and in the future you can

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,840
get news will begin to release news

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,940
about what we're doing through all

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,950
things open again which is now more of a

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,630
universe type site encompassing

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,859
everything that we do and you can see

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,910
some of the things that we've already

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,290
posted are really a blog post describing

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,080
what we're doing in person here tonight

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,110
but also what we do seven steps that we

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,060
take try to try to ensure diversity and

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,430
inclusion at our events just seven

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,800
things but we'll begin to go into more

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,930
depth about what we do a lot of people

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
ask us and I'll be the first to admit up

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,590
to this point we've been it hasn't been

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
intentionally secretive or anything like

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,190
that but it's just we've been so busy we

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,479
have such a small team we haven't

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,040
released a lot of this stuff so we're

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,139
going to begin talking about more of

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,729
this stuff publicly moving forward so

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,680
that is the site and where you can sort

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:56,330
of find that so that's again the new

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,570
site moving forward so please be aware

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,440
of that and if you don't mind please

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,490
spread the word because you know someone

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,140
coming to the site for the first time

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,940
expecting only to hear about the

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,350
conference and things like that they are

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,430
going to be in for a bit of a surprise

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:17,200
so you saw again all things open as well

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,200
