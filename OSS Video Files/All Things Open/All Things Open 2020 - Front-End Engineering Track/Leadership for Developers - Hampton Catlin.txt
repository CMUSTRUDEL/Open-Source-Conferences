Abstract: There is often a lot of tension in the field of programming around what it means to progress in your career, whether by seniority as an individual contributor or trying your hand at people leadership. We'll discuss the differences of types of leadership, how to understand your own leadership style and potential, and give a framework learned over 15 years in leadership in how to encourage leadership ethics in both hands-on and people-management roles.

hey

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
um i noticed this was on the front end

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,400
track

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
uh which i think is kind of funny um

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640
this definitely

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,000
is not specifically anything to do with

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
front end

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
but is something i'm really passionate

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,720
about which is sort of just talking

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
about

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
leadership and what that means

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
in the career of technology and i find

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,640
it's one of those kind of conversations

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
that

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,239
happens way too rarely at companies

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
to discuss what's the difference between

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
uh leadership

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
and technical leadership and what is it

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,920
you know why do we have leadership

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
um and i guess a lot of people have

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,399
questions of you know

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
should i be a leader is that the way i

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,360
need to move forward in my career

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
um and i just think that there's very

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760
rarely good answers to that

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,680
um i'm gonna give my take on this today

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,879
um and also give some sort of insights

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,399
on what i think

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,439
good leadership looks like um and then

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,479
uh yeah we'll do q a uh at the end

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,760
um cool so who am i

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,320

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
leadership

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,640
positions for over 15 years uh which

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
makes me feel old um but yeah i've had

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
teams up to 100 people

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
um actually that was as of june it was

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
100 people but

uh currently i'm actually ceo of an

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
early stage

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
company called vue um and i've held

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,159
positions from

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
well junior developer uh you know ceo

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
recently

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
it rent the runway for anybody familiar

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
with that um

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
but i'm usually put in the front end

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
track because

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
i uh also just you know along with my

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
other career

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,520
of having a real job um have invented a

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
lot of different sort of open source

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,920
technologies

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,520
um from a ton of ruby gems but mostly

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,399
uh known for sas the css language

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
and hamel which was kind of a rebellious

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
markup language that sort of inspired a

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
whole lot of white space sensitive um

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
html markups

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,920
um and yeah i built one of the first

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,879
mobile websites in the world for sort of

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
iphone and

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
interactive things at wikipedia so if

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
you've looked up with computer on your

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,760
phone

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
use something that i i started um but

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
like i said my actual career

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,959
is uh i've never actually done an open

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,440
source for

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,440
a living um at all and uh

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,560
i just get to throw the logo here of the

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,599
company i'm founding

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,760
we're super early stage um

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,680
check us out view live there's nothing

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,040
totally public yet because we're half

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,640
this is in that awkward moment where

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
there isn't like we're kind of

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
pre-launched but

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
um been doing it since june um

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,400
and then yeah i kind of mentioned this

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080
before but you know this talk should

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
only take about

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,040
20 minutes we'll see how things go um

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
and usually this topic has an awful lot

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
of

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
questions people have just about

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
business or leadership or how

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
you think about a tech company or what

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,640
you know challenges you faced

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,920
um and uh i'm just gonna preempt two

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,000
during that section since this is

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,400
recorded i am not going to say your name

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
out loud if you have a question to ask

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,599
i will just answer the question that

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
won't be in the recording so you can

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,879
ask something that you maybe wouldn't

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
want me to say your full name as i read

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
the question out

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
um cool let's we're going over four main

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
things

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
uh in the heart of this talk one the

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
goal of leadership

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
why why are we doing this the types of

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
leadership positions and how are they

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
different

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,920
what an effective team means and how do

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
you know when you've you've built one

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
and then really just sort of about

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
discovering yourself

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
and i think that's actually the area

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
that most people

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,120
are are interested in to be honest and

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
i love this quote treat people as if

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
they

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
were what they ought to be and you help

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,120
them become the thing they're capable of

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,560
being

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,319
that in a word to me is what or that

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
that represents what good leadership is

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
to me um

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,000
if that sort of thought

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
resonates with you and makes you feel a

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,919
lot of value you might be

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,199
good for people leadership but you also

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,759
might be good for leadership in other

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
ways

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
which we'll kind of get into a little

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,919
bit but let's go to

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
what's the goal why what why do we have

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,720
leaders

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,040
why send the org flat um and look a lot

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
of

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,120
jobs you know it feels like maybe your

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
boss or

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,639
people you've worked for like is is the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
job of a leader to ship

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
products is it to go to meetings does it

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
have one-on-ones is that what i'm doing

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
am i writing job requirements like

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,000
should i be demanding should i like

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
keep people in their place should i be

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
super nice should i be everybody's best

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
friends right

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
um i guess am i hiring people is that my

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,800
only job like

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
getting them not to quit like what what

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
what is the goal of what i am doing here

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,639
why am i doing any of this like

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,720
none of those things uh those can be

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
techniques they can be approaches

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
you know there's times where being nice

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
is useful sometimes you need to be

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
demanding there's certain moments where

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,199
that's

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,880
the correct thing to do but these are

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,919
all techniques or attributes right

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,720
they're not

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,000
um the goal like they're ways to achieve

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
the goal possibly

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,600
um so you should try to be nice um

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
but the goal of a leader is to empower

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
your teammates to use their talents

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
effectively

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
for their business um i add in for the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,600
business if you're not doing this in a

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
business context that's you can also

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
lead

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
um but for the shared goal of why

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,400
all of us are together if it's

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,520
leadership on a soccer team then

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,080
it's for the game but you know

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
it is about enabling other people you

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
know

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,280
any of those techniques to hire somebody

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,199
to give them goals to write a job

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
requirement the whole point of every

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,160
single thing needs to be in power

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,680
everybody communally to achieve um

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
and you know there could be a lot of

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
complexity to that a lot of different

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,319
approaches that

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,840
kind of depend on the company the

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
culture what you're building how you're

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
building

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,160
different personality types but i think

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,199
no matter what

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,360
like it should always be focused on

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,759
somebody else i need to make them or

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
help them and

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,800
like i think empowers all right give

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,479
them the tools to be effective

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
for what we're all trying to achieve

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
here um

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
and this is like this i can't believe is

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
a controversial statement uh

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,000
but it usually is i shock people with it

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,000
um almost across the

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
board we're gonna put a little asterisks

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,720
for less than one percent

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,520
but um people want to do a good job

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,720
like nobody in their career starts

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
wanting to not be good or to be lazy

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
or not useful or not helpful are there

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
people who are not

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,440
useful and are lazy in their job sure um

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
but like people generally don't start

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
that way

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,280
people tend to start wanting to do well

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
and a lot of times situations and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,240
usually it's it's disempowerment

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,680
causes people to be i feel like you're

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,599
angry disempowered sad

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
broken passive-aggressive lazy and

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,319
unmotivated

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,560
that's usually because people feel

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,360
disempowered they've either been shamed

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
by somebody

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
or not unable to do a good job or they

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
couldn't feel proud about what they were

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
doing

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319
and those that is that is when as a

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
leader you are doing

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
a poor job um and those are all these

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
things to look for but

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
you know i think it really is important

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
to focus on like

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
people want to wake up and feel good

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
about what they've done for the day like

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,960
you want to end the day and go home

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
and to your kids or your spouse or call

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,759
your

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
friends and be like i was super useful

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,800
that you got so much done right that

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
feels so good to people

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
um and for a lot of reasons people have

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,360
to stay in jobs sometimes when they're

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
unhappy but i think as a leader this is

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,800
actually people

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
for some reason i don't agree with it

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
often

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,319
um but i think it's an important lens um

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,240
and so sorry

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,319
and it is your job to make sure that

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
people remain there

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
um let's talk a little bit about some of

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,360
the types of leadership positions and

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,960
this is like about where on the stack

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
you sort of sit because i think people

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,919
think leadership is sort of like

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,199
one thing like your manager you're the

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
boss um

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240
but it's actually kind of complicated

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,759
but i'll simplify it to

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
what i have here sort of a rough

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,880
estimation so individual contributor

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,640
is somebody the phrase for somebody

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,599
who's doing the primary work

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,320
of the team or the business so a coder

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,920
um

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,279
is an individual contributor a manager

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,360
in my mind is a person whose primary job

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:57,040
is to it's in power but to ensure that

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
those people um uh are getting their job

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
done

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
and then the leader of leaders i think i

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
guess i did this

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,399
backwards now as i'm looking at my

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,279
slides let's start at the top

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,760
um so like a cto of vp our director

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,240
depending on the size your company

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
your job is to make sure that other

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
leaders are able

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
to make sure other people do their job

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,399
um so you're focused on things like

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,720
policy strategy like overall big

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
investments for a business and once

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
again doing my own thing

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
it's all about empowering the people

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,720
actually doing the work but

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,440
you know you have a step of separation

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
from that work actually happening um so

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah you know i

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,480
i uh and my that's right around the

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,720
runways vp of engineering like i spent

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,040
a significant impact amount of time i

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,080
did where like you know deployment rules

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,320
um what you know how our vacation

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
policy functioned uh one was like the

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
employee handbook and how like the

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
access uh

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,399
writing a acceptable use policy that i

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,279
felt was

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,640
ethically aligned with the company um

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
and what we were trying to do and like

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
as a message and like

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
to do that type of job you really have

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
to think

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,839
that matters um even though it's just

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
paperwork that people get and

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
only sometimes do they read it um but a

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
manager yeah

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,880
your job is to focus on the team keep

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
them productive and happy and it's much

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,560
closer to

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
whatever a delivery goal is that's sort

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,680
of more tangible

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
and then a yeah so a senior individual

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,480
contributor

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,160
does also have a type of leadership um

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
so like a staff engineer

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
um and you know you can empower at an ic

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,600
level

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
you know you can teach people things or

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
do code reviews or mentor or do

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,079
presentations

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,880
um but you know and

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
more junior you spend more of the time

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
um

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,240
working on deliverables now what are the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,839
impact why am i focused on this like

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,720
what are the impacts um because

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
this is something that confuses a lot of

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
people

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
um the more senior in an organization

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
you are

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
your job has a larger scope so your

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
impact is

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,200
is larger and the further down into an

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
individual contributor or junior

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,959
individual contributor so

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,000
your what your your level of scope is

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
much smaller

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,120
um leader of leaders it's it's abstract

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,760
a lot of what you're dealing with there

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
are no clear concrete answers and a lot

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
of ambiguity is what you need to deal

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,959
with you make a change

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
to a policy or something you might have

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
ten

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
percent of the your team hate you and

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
quit right and that might be what you

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,720
have to do but like

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,959
you're it's complicated um

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
also literally more unknowns uh it was

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,720
much more of a blank canvas

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
um there's things you might not ever

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
learn if

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,600
you did it and then as you're more

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
junior you know what your job is you

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
have tickets you've got a sprint you

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
know where you're doing you've like

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,399
talked through stuff

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,760
um leader of leaders people don't talk

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
about this there's less direct

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,000
satisfaction

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,120
um at the end of a week uh

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,240
as a leader of leaders uh it is mere

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,200
impossible to know

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,240
if you did a good job or don't walk away

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,440
and be like

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,279
nailed it look at what we did it's very

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
large there's a lot of teams a lot of

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,880
things happening a lot of departments

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,880
it's very like

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,320
you know you might not you might like

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
have most of your teams doing well and

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
you just know

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
somebody gave notice and like it's

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,040
really hard to like

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
be like yay so everybody's doing great

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
but my friends is leaving right or

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
something like

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
it's a little harder to like point at

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
something um

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,160
and then you know i think this is kind

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
of

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,839
i've been alluding to it but like it's

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
it's hard to know

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
what success is at very senior levels

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,720
because

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,279
like the ceo of

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
instagram instagram super popular was

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,120
bought by facebook

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
very made a lot of money but maybe it

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
could have been bigger

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
maybe maybe it should have been buying

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,600
facebook did you make the right decision

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
even at a billion dollars like was that

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,839
good

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,320
and there's no right answer for that no

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,320
nobody knows you never know

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
maybe maybe not maybe that was the exact

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
right move um

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,519
like you don't really get to look back

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,160
and say

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
um and then that's a mental thing too it

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,279
is true and you might think i'm the most

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,079
insane person for thinking

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,600
that a ceo would think i sold a company

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
for a billion dollars and have regrets

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,279
on that

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
um it is very complicated uh to know

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,360
that

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,079
but then more junior you know sort of

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
like i did all my points this sprint and

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,839
held a

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,600
you know a training i did it like my

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
manager's happy we launched

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
um and like i think the reason why i'm

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
talking about this

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,639
is because looking inside yourself about

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,079
what type of roles and like what are the

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,240
things you enjoy

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,399
um like if you are a person and a lot of

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,920
analytical people especially engineers

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,360
like to produce something gives you

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,600
the thrill it's why you

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
like got into engineering right like i

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
like delivering code

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,480
i can do that as a job i'm writing my

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
code these days um

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
but i've also learned like i'm fine with

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,959
totally the ambiguous stuff i can find

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,000
that joyful

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,720
right i can find it in there um and i

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
think

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
like that is you know it's gonna be a

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
theme of this whole thing that is you're

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
the number one difference between

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
leadership and not is are you okay on

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
that clarity of success

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
um sometimes over achievers so like

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,079
let's say you were a

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
track runner in high school and you got

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,079
the gold medal first place every time

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,079
sometimes it's really hard those people

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,720
struggle in leadership sometimes because

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,480
you

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,639
think well i didn't get a award

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
what who's who nobody told me i did a

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,560
great job um because that's

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,920
leaders don't get told

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,279
that like to well have you taken q a

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,680
uh but like you don't um i think

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,279
other people think that happens uh

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
it's not all bad by the way leadership's

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
really really enjoyable but it's just

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,639
some of those aspects just aren't there

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
um and so

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,760
let's talk about a little bit like how

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
do you know like when you do have to

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
look at am i

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,079
doing a good job like what does it mean

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,959
to empower my teams and how do i know if

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,160
i'm doing that

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,720
um there we go so

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
google did they spent a ton of money

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
this was

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,560
i think like the late 2000s um

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
i spent a ton of money trying to figure

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
out how to build effective teams

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,360
obviously they invest a lot in their

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,959
workers and

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,040
they wanted to try to put a little more

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,639
science to what they've been doing

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,759
and uh the number one thing

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,720
uh and it's here on purpose

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,279
is something called psychological safety

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
and that is

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,279
can you take a risks can you sorry can

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
you take risks

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
without feeling insecure or embarrassed

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
so if you fail

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,800
something you take on a ticket and you

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,320
fail and it doesn't look good um or

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,800
the the team trusts each other and

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,560
that you can make a mistake and that is

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,320
okay that was the number one indicator

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
when they looked at teams so

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,199
more than and i want to point out other

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
things things that are on here this is

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
about total effectiveness of the team

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
things that are on here are not do they

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,440
have a master's degree years of

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
experience had way less to do with team

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,639
success

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,440
um than these attributes and even teams

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
that didn't

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
get along when they had these um

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
performed like it was it's very

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
interesting they've got this all on

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
their website you should go check out

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
more

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,680
um but another one dependability um can

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
you count on each other

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,120
structure and clarity do i know if i'm

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
doing a good job what am i supposed to

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,839
be doing here

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,440
um like how do i know i'm doing a good

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,199
job um

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
is there is there meaning to your work

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,800
and by the way i

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,680
that is important um to make sure that

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,320
people know

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
how they're having an impact but i just

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,440
want to go back these are in order

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,199
it is much more important that you feel

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
safe than you

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,320
work on meaningful work is much

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,440
much more important and then yeah the

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
last one is sort of

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
are you making a difference which i

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
think people think the impact or the

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,360
meaning

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,880
or you know the number one thing that

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,839
would keep people motivated

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,640
um but having the safety to try um and

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,559
fail

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
is is a thing that has sort of the

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,919
outsized

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,400
impacts and this goes to a word that um

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,280
is really there's a great book called

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,559
culture code

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,400
um that talks about this a lot but a lot

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
of these attributes dependability

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
especially

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,679
in psychological safety is leaders we

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,799
i personal opinion and others but

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,000
uh we need to be vulnerable

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,520
and that means i have to model

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,400
for my teams that i trust them

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
trust is often described as something

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
that

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,480
grows over time just naturally like

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,400
um that i have a neighbor and the fact

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,520
they haven't robbed me yet

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,799
that we've never talked um that i don't

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
trust them

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,520
uh it doesn't actually work that way if

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
i give them a key

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,039
they actually that made me vulnerable

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,880
now they have a key to my place

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,480
um i'm more likely to grow trust for

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,840
them they're growing trust with me too

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
because they know that i trust them and

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,400
so therefore

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,720
there's a lovely synergy um and that is

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
like vulnerability is those steps you

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,120
take to open yourself up

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
and you know i tend to in an interview

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
or where i'm talking to people you know

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,640
i share

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,559
my struggles like i i've been

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,080
interviewing uh some junior developer

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,840
positions and you know i know

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,360
times have been very tough out there for

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
uh junior developers i'm sure some

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,640
people on this call are

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
you know trying their best to get their

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,039
first job and like

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
you know it took me four years due to

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
some

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
dropped out of college and it was the

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,520
dot-com bus but it took me four years to

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
get my first job

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,880
and like i think i'm a pretty darn good

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,799
programmer i think i've

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
been pretty good in leadership but one

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
of the reasons why it's 15 years and not

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,760
like 18

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
um is because i couldn't get a job like

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,880
i couldn't get my first chance and once

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,919
i did my career took off

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,520
um but you know i can admit that i

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,080
wasn't able to get a job like that

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,600
makes people now they they see me being

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,200
vulnerable and now they'll share with me

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,480
their actual experience right

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,640
and that is the way i want to start out

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
every working relationship and

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,679
when you do that that gives people

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,039
psychological safety

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
because i'm saying hey i've been through

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,360
this too we can do this together right

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,080
i make mistakes that's really important

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,039
when you're saying that as a manager

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,520
like you are modeling the behaviors that

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,559
you need in your teams

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,640
and there's the most important words in

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
any level of leadership if you are a

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,280
staff engineer or

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,120
a manager you need to use this word at

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,880
least once a day

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,240
i don't know it is so important to say

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
when you don't know something

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,000
um because you don't there are things

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,480
you do not

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,080
know and leadership does not mean you

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
have all the answers it means you might

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,320
try to solve them they're trying to

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
unblock things

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,960
but you don't know you don't know things

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,080
and specifically you know

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,159
like not having all the information or

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,600
going to get it later or letting people

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,640
know that they don't have to know

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,799
everything

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,200
it can be a really toxic environment

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,720
which i think most companies

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,799
or many companies and many managers

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
and senior tech leadership just won't

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,280
say this word i mean i've certainly

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
worked with people who

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
i've never heard them say they don't

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,960
know they go of course of course

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,919
of course yes um yes i'm familiar with

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,880
the

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,799
six sigma 9b yeah what do you think i am

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
an idiot um and that just like doesn't

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,360
build

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,120
trust or this vulnerability so here's

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
like i'm gonna do a little role play

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,520
um let's say that a very difficult

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
technical situation came up

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,559
and you know there's a race condition in

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
the database

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,240
um and so one of your employees or

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,840
co-workers comes to you and it's like oh

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,200
that was horrible um and

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,360
kind of i would say the traditional

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,919
non-vulnerable models like yeah uh-huh

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,159
no it's

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,520
actually like it's a race condition you

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
should go figure it out like this is

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
easy like i can't believe it took you

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,159
this long to notice it

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,039
um or you say um

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,640
like i don't i don't know how this

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,919
difficult issue works can you explain it

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
to me or let's help figure it out

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,799
together like

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,159
i'd love to hear what you've discovered

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,799
so far um

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,600
like let's let's try um i hate these

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,159
really tricky

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,919
cases right they they're very difficult

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
like when you say that like

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,520
the engineer is much more motivated i

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,960
believe in the second one

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
um because you're like all right cool no

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
it's great i was stressing out about it

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,799
a lot but now like i'm gonna go figure

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
it out like i can do this

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,400
it is complicated like you're validating

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,600
that they're trying

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,880
um and uh like here's another one

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,679
so this is classic somebody comes on

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,559
who is very green new to the job and

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,200
they

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,919
are asking to take on a very large

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,360
project

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,720
um and you know there's a lot of

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,600
stakeholders it's

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,760
very important and you know it is a

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,280
leader that can be a scary ask because

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,039
you've got to hit a balance here on how

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
you respond um

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
and i've definitely seen this

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
traditional answer from a ton of people

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
uh that's only for senior people to work

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,919
on it's too important

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
uh you might mess it up and we can't

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,400
risk pat

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,320
the right way to do this is when i was

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,840
just starting out i really struggled

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
with a big project like can you tell me

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,320
more about how you want to solve it

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
and then i'm giving them first of all i

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,039
started with

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,640
there was something that i needed to

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,919
like just to let them know

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,120
um that i'm human

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,720
um and then i'm asked i'm giving them a

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,320
bit of a stage because maybe they

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
actually can handle it right i actually

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,880
as a leader this might be a brilliant

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,240
engineer who's perfect for this or they

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
actually have no idea and they were just

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
like

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
somebody encouraged them or they've got

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,440
notions

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,440
um that's an irish phrase for

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,360
any irish people on the call um but

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
you know i also want to say like it's

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
funny doing these examples

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,440
um where i'm starting out with almost

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,120
all of these admitting something that

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,159
um like i can't do or something like

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,600
you know nagging myself almost or it can

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
sound like that

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,559
you have to remember that from the view

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
of an employee

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,640
their manager and manager's manager or

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,480
somebody in a leadership position

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,559
um they will default to thinking

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,400
that they sorry they first of all don't

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,640
get to talk to you that often

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,679
like probably you're not spending all

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
day talking

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,080
um they're nervous when you're talking

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,919
about one of these sensitive subjects

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
and they think that you're going to give

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,240
the traditional response or they're

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
worried

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,480
beforehand so even though it seems a

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,760
little crazy to always sort of say stuff

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,240
actually the perception um is

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,880
different than it sounds like as a

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,480
leader

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,200
um i think the i love the

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
uh steve jobs uh was it tell them what

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
you're gonna tell them

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,520
tell them and then tell them that you

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
told them um

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,159
and that in any time you're giving

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,919
information tell it at least three times

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,919
um and that's the only way people really

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
remember things and it sounds a little

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,400
bit crazy if you go back and watch a

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
steve jobs

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,360
presentation he'll say the same damn

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,200
stuff over and over again but those are

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,400
some good presentations

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,799
um and uh okay let's talk about feedback

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
though

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
so so far it sounds like working for me

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,919
would be

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,760
as an example i would eat nothing but

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,720
nagging myself and

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:35,760
uh you know nice all the time

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,640
being vulnerable and that equity that is

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,960
built up

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:44,320
by doing that allows a leader to give

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,720
feedback and feedback is when you tell

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
somebody that it is not going well

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,159
there is something that they need to

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,679
change um

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,039
feedback it took me at least 12 years of

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
being in leadership before

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,919
i think i was half okay at it and it's

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
still something that requires practice

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,679
but

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,320
you know the core thing that i

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,520
focus on is that it's much worse not to

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,120
give feedback

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
let's say you have somebody on the team

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
and they never write

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,200
tests and you've kind of mentioned to

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,240
them a couple times

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,880
um but maybe just like only in passing

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,640
or like

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,559
a past aggressive pr uh response

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
they there might be a couple different

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,600
reasons why that's happening

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,880
um but if you pull them aside separately

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,440
and say i just have to let you know i

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,960
like your job you need to write tests

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
that is a requirement here

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
you have not been writing them those are

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,240
not meeting expectations

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
but i know you can do it and if you need

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,400
help reach out at any time

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
let's talk about this next week but i

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
really need you to make sure that you're

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
focusing on building those tests and let

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,039
me know anything i can do to help you

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,159
write tests better

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,240
you have to say things like that and

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
when you've built up that vulnerability

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
with somebody

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,679
they know you have their best interest

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,799
at heart i'm not coming from a place of

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,799
i'm the greatest

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,480
um i don't try to do a quote-unquote

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,159
 sandwich i don't know can i say

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
that on this um

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
you just say to the issue and what the

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,919
follow-up is um

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,360
and you just say it as directly and

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,600
concisely as possible

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,400
um i sometimes when i was first learning

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,559
to do this

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,919
i'd write it down and make sure i'd like

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,600
almost workshop it to make sure i had

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,000
the right words and practice it and say

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,559
it

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,880
as straightforward with no emotion and

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,919
just a very direct sort of statement

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,400
and you know i am an emotive person and

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,039
like

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,159
it is at first unnatural but i can tell

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,960
you it works

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
like i have had employees who they were

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
unhappy in their job they didn't know

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,240
a lot of times they don't know what an

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,600
expectation is people just want to know

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,880
what it is to do a good job um and

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,760
that's where like this very simple

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
phrase it's not that simple um trust

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
drives usefulness which drives respect

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
which i think drives happiness

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
like this is how you build a team this

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,240
is how you have a high performing team

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,240
who are engaged in what they do

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
by building that sort of feedback like

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,799
one thing i tell

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,600
people who work for me is i am striving

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,720
that you will

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,240
never like you'll never not know what i

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,799
think about you

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,360
like i am not going to go beneath my

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
breath

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,240
talk to somebody to the side like if

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,440
you're in my organization i will tell

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,799
you how you are doing

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,559
um i will tell you when you're doing

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,279
well and i'll tell you when you're not

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,120
doing well

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,559
like that is something i sign up for as

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,960
a leader and

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,880
they can trust me that like i am telling

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,440
you and i will tell you

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
um and that like gives that actually

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,120
gives people safety

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
that's the other thing right so a lot of

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,240
times if you're a manager who just

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,559
relies on like um

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,080
little subtle hands and intuition you

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,799
know and you're hoping they pick it up

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,320
people get paranoid like i've and i have

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,640
messed up in the past with this like a

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
ton

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
you know i thought i was sort of subtly

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
indicating to somebody some information

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
about what i thought or that they

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,799
weren't

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,600
doing what i expected and i didn't

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,679
address it

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,279
and you know i ended up letting that

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,600
person go

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,960
and you know i had team members who were

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,520
just like

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
are you gonna do that to me like you

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
know

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,240
they saw why i did what i did but it was

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,559
like

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
they it hit safety it hit safety a lot

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,960
that was you know that was something

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,440
that i really regret because

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,360
i think if i with them had been giving

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
better feedback continuously

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
i don't think we would have been in that

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
situation because they'd be like yeah i

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,120
know he doesn't want to do it well he

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
tells me what i'm not

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,880
um and like those two things are very

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,080
important to know the difference between

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,600
um cool last one's just self-discovery

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,559
and like once again all these things are

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,360
underpinning the same um

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,679
can you value indirect outputs that is

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
the

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,960
core question to me of if you can do

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
people leadership

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
or if it's a good fit do it sorry enjoy

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
it that's far

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,240
far far more important if you enjoy it

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,120
you'll eventually get good at it

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,440
um if you hate it you will not uh but

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,600
can you value indirect outputs

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:11,360
so can you look at you know

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,080
like i like in my current startup like

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,440
can i no i didn't build most of it i'm

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
not involved in it i didn't do our

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
marketing campaign

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,320
but i enabled those things to happen

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,000
indirectly

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,360
and like can you as a analytical minded

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,320
person which i'm guessing almost

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,279
everybody on this

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,240
called an open source conference is uh i

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,559
which i am

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,799
but as an analytical-minded person can i

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,399
convince myself to look at those things

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,200
and drive satisfaction from them

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,399
um because this is like the number one

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,799
thing that i see burnout

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,440
from leaders like there's a lot of times

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,520
where people

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
move into leadership positions and then

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,159
are miserable and usually they end up

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,399
quitting

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,919
um which like you know the um

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,440
the normal kind of path here if this is

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,960
a direct path and this is from my

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,880
philosophy on this is that

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,640
you know sort of after you're a senior i

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
see you kind of either move into like

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,559
pure technical leadership or people

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
management which is sort of at the top

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,200
um and we do i think it's a good way to

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,720
look at it especially

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,480
i think it's good to call out that there

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
are career options outside of people

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
leadership that are paid very well and

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
you get lots of

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,840
important things they do have some of

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,440
the similar abstracts a principal

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,279
engineer isn't

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,399
launching the same way they are it's

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,080
very technically minded they're not

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
dealing about people's feelings quite as

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,440
much

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,080
but mentoring making big decisions those

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,960
are still

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,559
still there um i think at any level of

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
career growth in any industry

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,480
there's some level where you say how far

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,120
can i push myself into those abstract

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
takeaways but so many times people and

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
prob

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,799
possibly people in this call your

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,360
manager or director or vp or one of

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
these

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,799
you know they went down that path

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,520
because they thought that was the only

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
path

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
and once your pride is there but you

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
hate your job

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,559
and you're supposed to be responsible

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,399
for people uh it is not a you know a

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,240
happy ending generally people quit

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,840
you know i've had this happen to me i

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
promote somebody to manager

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
three months later they quit they took

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,080
an ic job at another company and i'm

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,200
like

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,080
oh wait no i just because i trusted you

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,679
you should come back

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,080
you asked for it you know a lot of times

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,039
they they begged and scream i want to be

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,880
a manager

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,159
um and that's why i just think it's

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,399
really important to put these arrows

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,399
back

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,399
you can move back into the pure

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,200
technical roles that is

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,559
like if it your company that isn't true

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,000
um you should go

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,679
uh same thing happened to me welcome um

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,679
so you can always move back and i think

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,279
it's really important to let people know

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,559
that they can and yeah once again if

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,679
your company doesn't have this i'd

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,159
recommend

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,960
suggesting it um just to explicitly sort

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,559
of say

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
um you know you could move all the way

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,480
up to vp but if you haven't actually

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,760
extended your technical skills

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,760
you don't get to move just down to

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,960
principle which also having this

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,399
structure you know the fact that there's

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,880
authority attached with the people

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,039
management and many different ways

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,399
like a vp can override a principle on

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
certain things because theoretically

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,320
they're

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
looking at some more of the business

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,720
strategy maybe than the principle is

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,600
um but with that like there's also as we

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,720
write uh

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
like recognition that people like the

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,840
technical path

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,120
is hard earned you know and that is

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,399
something that you do have to work out

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,240
from just because you

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,159
had a bunch of direct reports and wrote

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,279
a good policy does not mean that you are

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,679
necessarily

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,279
you know a good engineer um and

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,720
sometimes that's why the diverging path

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,559
can be sort of a thing

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,399
so i've always just said you default to

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,039
senior ic and we'll work you back up if

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,360
you want

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,640
um and i've had people take that option

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
and they've been very happy after

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,919
they've done it

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,919
um and i just think like

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,080
i call it find your core value like in

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,519
any situation

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,240
just find where you can be valuable how

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,080
you can deliver

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,200
value to what everybody's trying to do

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
and like that might be in people

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
leadership

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,880
uh that might be by taking a ticket

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,279
right or working on a bug like i don't

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
that that can be a thing but find find

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,240
the biggest

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,919
positive impact you can and put yourself

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,919
there and if that's leadership

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,360
push into it like heck if the things

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,240
i've been saying you're like that's me

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,960
i'm great with that do it um if you're

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
thinking oh

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
i don't know abstract i don't like that

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,200
i like concrete classes

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,640
um then you know pro probably

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
focus on that technical thing there's a

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,919
great career there but either way

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
make sure you're having fun like it is

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,519
work

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,640
but if you are miserable you are doing

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,960
the wrong thing

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,840
like you're in the wrong position we are

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,600
lucky

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,960
in this industry that there are choices

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
less choices if you're a junior

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,000
developer during covid

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
um but you know even if you are stuck at

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
home

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,279
there's lots of volunteer opportunities

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,399
i know our moderators some of them

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,960
uh have been doing this and like go do

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,519
those

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,760
ways to add value and like find the fun

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,679
in it um and and go after that

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,960
um so this wraps up the

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,560
content part how do i do

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:13,200
got 15 minutes left um

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,200
let me stop sharing so i can see um

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,440
there you know i'm just bigger for all

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,639
of you um

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
so if anybody has any questions uh any

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,839
really this is pretty wide ranging i'm

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,200
happy to talk on

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,839
pretty much anything um and i'll repeat

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,720
once again

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,839
i am not going to say the name of

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,520
whoever said anything

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,800
just because this is recorded and i want

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:41,919
to give you all the psychological safety

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,919
um cool

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,839
um so there's a little q a

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
feature

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,639
no questions

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,680
um oh somebody said uh i did just that

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,000
oh you just moved from a technical lead

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,280
back

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,640
yeah that's i'm like don't i'm so glad

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,320
to hear that your company supported that

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,599
so many people let that be a bad thing

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,040
like that is not

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
i think to be a leader you have to be a

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
little bit crazy to be honest

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,720
um

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,599
um are there any correlations that i've

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
seen between

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
age and technology-related coding type

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,079
jobs

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,520
yes yes um i mean i

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,960
i feel like maybe what you're asking is

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,560
like is ageism real um it is

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,599
uh i think it can be a little bit tough

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,560
um there's a couple different ways to

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,440
deal with

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
uh getting older in this industry um i

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,160
mean first of all

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
coming to conferences like this and

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,119
hearing about other people's experiences

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,800
helps a lot

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,760
um i think people get the wrong

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,760
impression

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,160
i think as a person who's up there

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,550
and or like who's later in their career

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
um

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,280
[Music]

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,560
there's fear and a lot of

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,839
i've heard like i hear this in like

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,359
manager conversations you know when

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,960
you're doing like a hiring panel and i i

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,480
try to call it out because i actually

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,000
best tires i've ever made are people who

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,160
are more advanced in their career

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
because they've seen some stuff um but

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
there's basically they know like have

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,160
you been stuck

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,560
in one thing so you can either basically

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,320
get stuck in one thing and like do it so

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,640
if you if there's a technology that you

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,760
love like stick with it long term and

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
just be like

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,240
that the joke is that like there's

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,839
always like fortran programmer jobs like

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,680
they get paid a whole lot of money and

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,359
they're like all the all the code you're

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,119
writing will be like a c code one day

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,720
um that's not a very inspiring answer

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,400
but that's part of it um

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,079
but the other one is just to actively

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,040
continuously learn

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,720
um like that's stay up with the latest

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
stuff teach yourself new things every

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,040
year like

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,880
technology in the fact that it is novel

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,520
requires sort of a level of like

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
novel ness and the majority of what

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,560
people work on like

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,680
like new is is what we're building like

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,880
technology is about

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,520
changing the status quo um farming

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
like using a plow was technology for

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,920
just a little

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,040
bit of time and it remained technology

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,359
but now it's invisible and you don't

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
even

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,560
think about it right that's not a tech

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,119
job to to use a plow

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,640
now to make a more advanced machine that

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
it so we're always on the cutting edge

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,440
so

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,960
i think sort of either like focus in on

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,400
the thing or just make sure on your

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,160
resume when you're job hunting it's

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,680
really super clear that you sort of

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,640
kept up with things um and it stinks um

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,440
i wish it wasn't

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,599
true um what are some of the books that

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,880
have influenced me on leadership

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,280
i come with a core distrust um

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,599
i think we can get a psychology of it a

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,480
lot distrust of other

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,920
people's strong opinions but there's one

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,000
book that i will give a total

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,520
strong answer to for recommendation it's

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,520
called culture code

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,240
um i i basically read it and was like

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,119
oh okay this this matches my experience

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,160
and what i've seen

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,760
very closely um and i basically made

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
sure all my managers went and read it

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,640
just because it was very aligned with

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,800
with my view and a lot of the stuff i've

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,000
been talking about here um also

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,680
like brene brown stuff um brave uh she

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
has a lot of stuff on bravery and

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,119
vulnerability and stuff so it's all

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,040
pretty pretty aligned there so i

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,839
recommend anything by any of them

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,880
um favorite part about being a manager i

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,160
mean y'all really came with good

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
questions real fast all right

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,880
um favorite part about being a manager

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,680
uh oh

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,480
taking a bet on somebody and seeing them

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,800
succeed

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,920
like i'm so proud of the people i've

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,480
hired who

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
were non-traditional in so many

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,160
different ways like uh

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
i'll like well to go to the ages of

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,920
question i heard a guy who was like in

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,359
his 60s who it was a kodak for like

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,160
20 years and um like a hard smoking

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,560
frenchman

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,160
and like everybody else in when i made

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,560
the decision was like what he has no

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,560
cloud experience he like literally

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,400
did wiring and i was like this guy can

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,359
be our director of cloud and

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
at that company he was amazing he

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,560
learned it all so fast and it all just

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,040
hit pair and like that is

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,640
like i love giving somebody a chance who

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,320
is just not in a great situation

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,520
and sorry obviously like junior people

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,720
people in underrepresented groups like

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,240
that that's

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,040
the worst part is yeah it's the lack it

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,240
it there's you always have to watch what

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,359
you say

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,280
that's the worst part about being a

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,560
manager because your words have

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,240
power which is great but they also have

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,160
negative power right it is a

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,520
it is a power and so if you phrase

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,359
something poorly

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,839
like you can really impact people in a

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,480
lot of different ways from legally to

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,200
emotionally and i think that's it

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
because i'm like

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,480
it just requires you have to have a

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,760
filter on um

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,680
and that's that can be very draining

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
um how do i recommend going about

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,520
getting asking for promotion

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,839
at each level and clearly to find oh i

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,720
hate it when they do that

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:02,000
um so there's a couple of things

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,119
uh i in my last we don't have one yet in

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,760
this company because

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,880
two employees but um we had a very

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,240
detailed

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,800
what we call a continuum it was

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,920
basically career ladder on steroids

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,599
um and it run the runway and it's a

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,839
it's very effective um and we did assign

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,119
kind of numbers at different skills like

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,760
feedback or

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,640
systems design or languages or whatever

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,720
there was different like

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,680
levels in each one had a very clear or

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,200
as best of a clear

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,880
definition as we could get at every

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,880
single level so there's something like

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,720
like a thousand different descriptions

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,640
um were in this thing

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,319
um but uh i'm gonna

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,839
okay that could be a whole talk itself

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,520
i'm gonna give you the actual advice

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,200
if you actually want a promotion and you

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,720
actually want a raise you need to go get

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
a competing offer

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,560
it's we're not supposed to say that i

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,560
feel like the managers

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,599
the leadership guild will like turn in

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,119
my card

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,880
um but you need to

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,800
come with something else especially if

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,000
you're looking for um

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
money like it is amazing how quickly uh

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,119
people will

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,560
change it um now that being said

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,520
obviously i'm assuming at this point

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,720
that you've been getting you've been

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
asking for feedback

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,440
you've been working on your skills

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
you've been doing mentoring you've been

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
doing the things

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,440
you've been asking co-workers you're

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,880
using whatever utilities are there i'm

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,160
assuming that happened

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,599
don't go do it if you stink at your job

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,200
then they're just like all right get out

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,319
um all right five minutes left

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,839
um uh

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,359
how much how do you know how much risk

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,160
to give a junior developer in project

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,040
assignments

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,640
uh risk is fine just keep it short keep

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,520
the time period short for what they're

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
doing so

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
i might throw like if a developer saying

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
hey you're not challenging me i'll be

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,920
like

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,760
all right cool like i need you to go

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,800
wire up this very complicated part of it

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,200
and like

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,240
let's talk like i it would take a senior

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
developer two days and i'm gonna give

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
you two days on it

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,839
um like and be open that you're checking

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,880
in with them like i

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,720
the thing you can't do is like uh

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,200
like let them just work on their own in

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,720
a closet on something that isn't

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,319
like that nobody's checking in on or

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,000
looking at like that that that's when

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
things go wrong and they get miserable

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
and

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,680
they're panicked and sometimes um

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,880
actually the person i mentioned earlier

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,319
had to let go was

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,760
more he was more junior than i thought

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,839
and i was just like i don't know i trust

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
you you've got it

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,040
um like that didn't go well so it's not

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
actually the risk i think the risk is

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,480
the time so if it's two days and it's

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,960
something really complicated you're like

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,960
oh we need to work on this um i think

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,880
that's fine but you also like it's

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,400
important to

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,000
there are some junior developers who are

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,599
freaking brilliant and like

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
if you're only giving them little simple

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,240
pieces that are only achievable

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,680
every single time and like at what you

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,040
think their levels and not pushing them

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,760
then you'll never find out how good they

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,200
are what are your suggestions for what

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,160
kind of leadership roles in tech are

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,839
open to some of the leadership

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,200
experience in another industry

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,040
uh all of them uh in my little chart

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,560
i generally the rule of thumb i say is

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,680
that you need to become a senior

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,640
sorry and rules we usually think senior

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,359
engineer is sort of the level that any

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,560
people

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,400
manager should be in like an

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,280
organization i think it's very bad if

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,079
you have senior

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,920
senior leadership who doesn't really

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,200
understand parts of the stack or parts

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
of the job like i think

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,720
um you know i would recommend

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,319
if you are looking to go into leadership

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
inside the tech org which i'm like

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,680
you'd probably be good for based off

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
this

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,280
git is broad of experience know about

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,800
databases know how rendering engines

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,560
work in browsers go learn

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,119
how mobile development works like get

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,000
that broad base of systems design and

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,040
understanding

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,560
so that you can kind of have an

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,760
intuition when people work for you who

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
do something that you're maybe not an

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,200
expert in but you at least need to know

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,280
the vocabulary in certain things so

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,119
um but i think those things apply really

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,040
well because

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,480
the technical aspect outside of knowing

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,760
and being able to translate doesn't

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
matter that much

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,040
um all right you got three minutes don't

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,720
worry

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,560
moderator i'm not going to go too long

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,240
um i'd like to be a tech lead but i'm

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,599
afraid it's like a whirlpool pushing me

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,599
closer to being a manager

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,440
uh i don't want to be a manager uh i

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,280
mean look just say that to

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,040
uh to your leadership um that is

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,720
that does not need to be the case in

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,119
most companies i am

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,079
more than fine i would love to have more

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,920
people who are just like

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,240
you know what a tech lead i'll run this

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,000
france you know

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,520
i'll be basically one-third the manager

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,640
of this group or help the day-to-day

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,000
operations and like

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,560
to me that's what a tech lead is a

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,319
little bit separate than like um

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,680
like a group leader on the technical

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,319
like a staff engineer is a little

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
different

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,560
because you're just bringing your

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,440
technical skill but to be a tech lead is

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,880
helping with

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,200
you're helping run the ship but you're

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,960
not like

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,319
one-on-ones all the time and so just

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,560
communicate that that is

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,319
very valuable in a company it's a great

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,599
way actually to learn staff-like skills

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,280
for mentoring and things because that's

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,119
a lot of what you have to do

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,800
but i wouldn't don't don't worry about

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,480
that just go into that role but be like

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,680
i am happy here i am not looking to move

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,800
into manager i want to continue to

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,280
improve my tech skills

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,160
i don't think i'd be happy i i don't

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
think they would

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,520
push past that or i've seen a lot of

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,960
people i i've had

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,640
far more people who are like can i be

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,319
manager now and i'm like uh

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,680
yeah we got a lot more work to do um

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,680
all right one minute it's also my last

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,040
question uh have you ever dealt with an

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
employee that seems slightly sensitive

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,240
to

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,359
suggestions communication sorry the

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,480
vulnerability

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:25,599
i mean i yes of course i've had people

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,160
in that situation uh but i i

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,359
have to set that up right like i need to

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,680
let

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,280
them see that i'm modeling that stuff

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,319
and it's very slow and sometimes people

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,599
will take things

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,760
sensitively um but i find just

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,880
you have to be blunt and direct about it

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
like it really

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
and it's not cruel right that's very

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,240
different like you just need to say the

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
facts of what you're seeing from my

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,920
perspective

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,960
this is going on and i'm allowed to have

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
that perspective because that's

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,319
basically

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,640
that is my job that's the subtext um and

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,400
i want to help you so let's work on that

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
um and i think adding those things are

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,599
better and like honestly if they can't

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,640
take that feedback then

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,000
it might not be a great fit but time

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,000
given time um

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,720
cool that is all of my time

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,040
uh at me on twitter if you have any more

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,160
questions i'm typing my email address

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,440
into the chat um i'm happy to answer

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,480
questions or whatever if people have

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
thoughts or things that they actually

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,200
want to talk about

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,560
um but i really appreciate everybody

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,240
giving me their time

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,119
this has been a real great honor and i

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:41,200
love talking about this so

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:41,200
