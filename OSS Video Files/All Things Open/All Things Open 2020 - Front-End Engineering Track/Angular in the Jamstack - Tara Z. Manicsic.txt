Abstract: The Jamstack is a recent trend in application architecture that allows developers to leverage their JavaScript, serverless, and API skills to deliver faster, safer and more reliable sites. The Jamstack is popular with both React and Vue but Angular is just starting to take hold of the benefits it has to offer. Weâ€™ll dig into creating a Jamstack site using Angular in this session from pre-rendering pages, using serverless functions to grab data, and serving from a CDN. See for yourself what we can do with this new approach to application architecture.
