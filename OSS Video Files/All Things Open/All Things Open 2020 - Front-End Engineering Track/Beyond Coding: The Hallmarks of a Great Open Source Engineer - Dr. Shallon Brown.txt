Description: 
	Presented by: Dr. Shallon Brown, North Studio
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Front-End Engineering Track

Abstract: Being a software engineer with longevity means more than obtaining a degree or certificate and knowing how to code. Often engineers may excel at coding, but still struggle with their careers long-term due to a number of other factors that stifle their career potential. In addition, many engineers enter the workforce without knowledge of what interviewers are really looking for, what it will take to prosper as it relates to a successful project, and how to avoid burnout. In this talk we will cover how open source engineers can overcome these challenges and enjoy a long, successful career.

Dr. Shallon Elizabeth Brown, a 20 year veteran of the software industry, explores the nuances of being an exceptional open-source developer for this talk. This will especially apply to anyone who is newer to mid-level as an engineer, and is interested in learning what specific things they should do to avoid burnout and thrive within a software development environment. This is also for hiring managers who want to know what qualities to look out for when interviewing new candidates.

	00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
all right

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,599
um if you are at all interested in

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
following up

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,759
after this talk um i would encourage you

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680
to go

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:21,840
to uh www www.northstudio.com

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,480
ebook to both receive and to review

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
our newest ebook which is on the upgrade

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
from drupal 8 to drupal 9 and what that

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
can ultimately mean

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
for your web application

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,520
okay so for the agenda for this top

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
speech

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,440
is uh first we're going to go over the

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,840
intro introduction of myself

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
and also define uh what great open

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
source engineering means because that is

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
of course an ambiguous term

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,360
as well as then talk about the flavors

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
of what great is

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
and the basics uh behind that what your

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
boss thinks

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
is great and defining what that means

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
because uh ultimately that's who you

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,559
within your career space are going to

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,600
uh be answering to what they don't teach

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,840
you in school

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
uh interviewing and job hunting 101

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
playing nice in the sandbox the burnout

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
factor

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
sage wisdom and conclusions and then

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
10 minutes of 10 to 15 minutes at the

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
end for q a

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
so as noted i am dr shalon brown i

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
have been at north studio off and on for

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,520
10 years and was promoted to

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,040
cto uh about a year ago uh we are one of

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,799
the oldest open source shops

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
in north america if the north american

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
corridor if not the oldest open source

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,759
shop

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,280
in existence um at 23 years and counting

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
i do have my doctorate and information

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,759
systems engineering

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
i was the first person in the world to

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
publish a dissertation successfully on

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
drupal

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
um specifically the title of the

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
dissertation was motivations and open

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,840
source

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
a quantitative study on drupal and

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
academia

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,159
in addition to that i graduated top of

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,880
my class 4.0 gpa

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,040
as the youngest black person uh to ever

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
receive a doctorate at that time from my

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
school

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,520
um as well as uh in the computer science

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,599
field

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,039
and specialization that i did it in um

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,920
as well as

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,239
the first black person uh in the world

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
to publish a dissertation on open source

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
um so i have 20 years industry

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,959
experience

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
my primary focus has been drupal

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,599
wordpress and full stack development

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,840
in in with over the span of the past 15

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
years

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
okay so wanting wanting to define great

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,920
within these terms

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,120
because that is indeed a very subjective

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
uh term in and of itself so what is

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
great

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
um great can be a lot of things and i

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,080
don't think that great ultimately has to

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
always be you know defined within the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
realm

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,519
of a doctorate or something that

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,959
necessarily is directly in the bounds

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,599
of uh the academic spectrum

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
um but great within this definition as i

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,400
when as i mentioned it is

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,640
mastery of craft so the idea of

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
mastering your craft um to the fullest

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,879
of its capacity

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
how whatever that means to you being

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,640
well versed in a wide variety of

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,400
technologies and stacks

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,159
a thorough understanding of the history

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
of where your craft has been and where

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
it's come from

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
is also important you have to learn

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,000
about those that have come before you

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,159
um to mask to truly master your craft

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,920
you cannot exist in a bubble

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,920
um and so that is a really important

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
thing as well um i think that what i

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,360
found is that the true

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
greats of any field whether it's

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
engineering

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,760
cooking uh writing whatever it is the

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
true greats of their craft are

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,519
are great because of the versatility

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
factor that comes with them

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
it isn't just being great at really good

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
at one variant or flavor of the business

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,200
it is

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,519
effectively mastering every and all

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,319
corners of your business model

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
um as best that you can and so when it

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,360
comes to coding and engineering

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
specifically yes the ability to code

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,239
according to industry standards

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,640
and keeping in line with your

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
specialization as well if you choose a

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,720
specialization

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,840
being able to mentor and lead others

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,239
it's not enough

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,959
just to be a good coder if you want to

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
be a great open source engineer because

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
you still have to be able to talk about

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
what you did and lead others

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
through that process and articulate it

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
to people who aren't necessarily

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
technical

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,600
that also comes with the craft and able

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
to understand the three major components

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
of

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,680
uh software as a service which is the

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
financing

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
uh sector um the engineering sector and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,440
then the marketing and business

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,800
development sectors

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,600
so let's talk about the flavors of of

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
great

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,880
as well so great can mean

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,120
great at the code the stack the system

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
management there's the management of the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
os

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
development life cycle so basically

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,919
managing the process

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
for getting things from point a to point

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
b from the development stage through

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,800
production stages

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,479
it can be coordination of technical

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
resources

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
presentation and demos of products and

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
the capabilities of your products

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
rfp and proposal content writing

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
technical sales architectural planning

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
technical deliverables and client

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,960
interaction those are all

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,039
um components or elements um that

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,120
can that you can hone and kind of have

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,919
this element of craft mastery

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
behind uh succinctly um that will

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
ultimately

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,240
enable you to have the best um

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,160
concept or grip um of where your

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,680
business model is going

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
and and why it's going there

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
so when we think about the the concept

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,800
of great in here i'm sorry one of my

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,560
slides has slipped skipped i believe so

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
when we think about the concepts of

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
great is

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
we we want to understand that in the

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,919
concept of what does your boss think

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,440
is great um what is it that ultimately

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,120
um that you you know feel is is

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,000
something that what you think is great

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
versus what your

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
your boss thinks is great or the people

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
that are managing your organization

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,800
think

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,479
is great um and ultimately that can be

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
very often and frequently be two

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,840
different things there is the concept of

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
doing

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
well at your job and getting the job

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
done and completing your deadlines which

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
is something that we all within the

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,120
workforce

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
have to ascend to but that doesn't

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
necessarily mean

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
that that's all and all encompassing of

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
what it is going to take to really be a

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
master of your craft

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,639
um and i think that you know ultimately

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,080
your boss is looking for a multitude of

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759
things

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
so um you know part of why i put this

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
here

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
is that i i watch i love cooking first

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
of all i'm a huge foodie

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
um but i put this example of gordon

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,479
ramsay here for a reason

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
um is that you know regardless of how

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
you feel about him and his personality

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
and all the yelling

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
that comes with the tv shows um outside

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,120
of all of that pomp and circumstance and

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
all of the drama of tv

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,800
um he is still a master of his craft to

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,680
get a five-star michelin restaurant

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,919
in his in his early thirties um is

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,880
something unheard of in his craft

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,599
that is a a beyond a doctorate it is

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,759
something that

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,280
people have literally committed suicide

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
um to try to obtain and less than a

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,199
handful of people have ever done it let

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,840
alone at the age that he did it

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,000
he has over 81 successful restaurants he

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
is the most successful restaurateur on

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
the planet that has ever walked the

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
earth

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,039
um and in so doing has made thousands if

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
not hundreds of thousands of other

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,479
people

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,800
successful in business with him um and

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,800
what makes him so great if you watch it

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
isn't just that he's a good cook that is

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
indeed the foundation of the house and

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,240
in the same way that you can't be

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
a five-star michelin chef with a

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
five-star restaurant in the middle of

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
the heart of new york city times square

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
without knowing how to cook you can't be

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
a great engineer and not know how to

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,440
code and master code

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,879
and similar to food the flavors are

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
always changing

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
i think it's important to understand

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,160
that

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
the flavor of your food and your palate

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
is going to change and quickly in our

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
field

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,080
um you know there wasn't a drupal when i

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
first started out um and now that there

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
is and then a wordpress and

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
and all these full stack models and so

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
you have to keep up on all of those

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
things

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
um in order to to truly understand where

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
your field is going and why it's why

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,960
it's doing that and to ultimately stay

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
on top of it

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,599
um so i think it's important to

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,719
understand that

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
so here's a little element here of of

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,560
what

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,800
you know what they don't teach you in

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,919
school and i i think part of what i want

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,120
i hope for you to walk away from um this

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,680
uh discussion from with is the concept

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
of

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,720
uh you know what it is that we're taught

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
if for those that go to either

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
engineering school

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
i use the term school a bit loosely for

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
for anyone that's gone through any type

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,519
of professional training

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,800
whether it's votec or some of these

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
online boot camps

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,320
um they are going to teach you in a

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
nutshell how to find complex solutions

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
to a complex problem which is the

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
definition of what engineering is by

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
dictionary that terms

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
in order to address to address a

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,440
specific set of needs

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
however that is not all encompassing and

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,279
there's a huge swath of the business

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
model outside of that

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
if you want to be a great engineer or i

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,880
should say what the expectations are

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,399
is that you have to hone your

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
communication skills and you have to be

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,080
a team player

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,160
um you can't you know it is hard for for

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,519
me as a cto i will tell you

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,320
um to have players on it on a team

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,839
that may be particularly good at

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
engineering and maybe

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
really good at being able to deliver

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
things on time

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
being able to um solve really complex

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
technical problems

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,200
um but don't get along well with other

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
people just from all kinds of inherent

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
personality issues or conflicts that

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,560
they have

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,399
and so that ultimately makes it really

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
hard right because then i have to

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,920
really think about who i'm going to put

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,720
within

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,240
with these people to interact with them

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,519
as a team right it's where we get web

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
projects where it's really built to be

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,000
executed all with just one engineer

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
um so setting and setting the estimates

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
and the deliverables and

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
if a client is asking us how much time

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
we think it's going to take to execute x

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
y and z

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
we want to have a succinct answer and we

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
want it to be as true to life as we can

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,880
predict it to be

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,800
um that's not to say that there won't be

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
estimates that are wildly off either in

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
the plus or in the minus that's going to

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
happen but

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
overall having a good average client

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,880
satisfaction with the pro

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,480
end product um avoiding the burnout

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,760
factor is also important

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,279
dedication enthusiasm professionalism um

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,959
you know you have to want to do this

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
this has to you know do if you have a

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,079
passion for it

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
that's the one thing i can't teach you

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
um i can't i can give you all of the

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
skills i can give you the tools the

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
software's

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,959
the elements that you need the ides all

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,279
of that but i cannot give you

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,040
a passion for what you do and the desire

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,079
to want to do good work and to want to

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,920
excel

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,440
and for me as a leader i think that

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
that's what i look for the most when i

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
hire talent

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
it isn't just having the checkbox of all

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
the skills um

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,279
off of the box of the requirements it is

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,360
understanding that

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,440
you want to do this and that this is

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,920
something that um you

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
enjoy doing and have a passion for

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
leadership qualities is also big being

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,200
able to have at least some amount of

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,680
mentorship and leadership drive

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,440
um is important um adherence to the

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,200
internal and industry standards

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
meaning that you know when i trust that

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
i'm going to give you an assignment it

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
is going to

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,240
um be in line with everything that i

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
would have ideally wanted

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,360
um if you know i was going to set out

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,959
to do this um without with whatever

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,399
content management system

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,560
um that it happened to be using or if

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,240
it's full stack as well

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
so but these are the you know your boss

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,760
wants all of these things right it isn't

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
just the the coding it isn't just as you

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
see the flavor of

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
what you're you're doing it is all of

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
these elements of the business that come

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
with

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,480
it okay

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
um so one thing i wanted to talk about

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,600
here is also the concept of

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,720
interviewing and job hunting skills um

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
because i think that that's

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
and always you know a really important

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
thing that i want to quickly address

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,079
that

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
you know most of the time i think a lot

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,959
of us would say um

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,680
is more in line with okay yeah i'm sure

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
we know that

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,360
and and all of those things um are a

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,560
given but in all

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,279
transparency i i think it's less um of a

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,040
given than

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
than what we would expect coming out of

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,279
engineering school so

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
um think of your think of my job for

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,000
example so at north studio

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,800
um we have you know about 150 active

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,160
clients

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,720
um yes 150 um and

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
you know we have i for the respective

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
client

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,480
client profiles we have of course

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
inevitably i need to hire people

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
um for a multitude of skill sets um both

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
on the discovery team side as well as

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
the engineering team

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
side so which is ui ux for when i say

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
discovery

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
um so your interviewers whoever you are

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
interviewing with

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
know that your your resume is in a pile

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,800
about

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,920
you know yay high as they would say and

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,160
gonna

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
make sure that my um screen here is a

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,959
little bit more minimized so that i can

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,399
also

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,320
you guys can also see me a bit better um

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
you've got a stack of resumes about yay

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,440
high and you really

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,000
want to be able to um

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
you know resonate with your group or

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
with

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,120
um the per people interviewing with you

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,839
as best as possible

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
and to do that you want to make your

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,320
resume stand out now you're going to ask

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,760
how do i make my resume stand out

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
when it effectively there is this

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,560
element of you don't know

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,880
what the ask really is right

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,760
um and so your interviews viewers desk

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,839
is a huge

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,959
pile up um of other things other

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,720
people um and ultimately you've got to

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
really stand out and make it in such a

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,360
way that it gets my attention to do that

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,199
highlight your experience i'm really

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
typically we're less interested

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
in all these other things that aren't

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
related but make your experience

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,199
palatable and make it specific tell me

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,880
what you did within that variant

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,480
um you get about 20 to 30 seconds nobody

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,000
is reading your resume from cover to

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,720
cover anymore that's not

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,639
um a realistic thing um we're usually

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,920
looking for the big keywords and roughly

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,360
how much experience you have in that

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
field that's it that's as quick as it

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,240
gets so

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
highlighting that is key always take

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
notes if you are

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,399
interviewing with anyone always take

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
notes um

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
it just conveys interest it conveys that

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
you

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
may want to look back and that you are

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
engaged in the conversation in the

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,000
organization

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,560
ask about their development stack in

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
detail and ask about opportunities to

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
learn

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,279
um new stack flavors and components

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,120
um i think that that is definitely um an

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,519
important part

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
of of all of this is to ask about their

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,199
development stack in detail

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,959
and about opportunities to learn the new

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,279
stack components

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,880
um look for the company who diversify

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
their stack profiles

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,800
try i would advise you not to get

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
pigeonholed anymore because

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
of the way that the market is going it's

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
important that you consider companies

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
that

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
may give you the opportunity to get your

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
hands dirty and

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,079
some some other open source elements for

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
free

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,440
rather than you having to learn it on

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
your own and all that comes with that

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,040
um it's it's better to get paid to do it

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
so if you can find companies that

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
encourage mentorship that at least let

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,079
you junior develop

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,680
um or get free access if it's not like a

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519
paid project get access to

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,959
um other things like if you're a drupal

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,639
developer see if you find companies that

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
also do wordpress and say hey

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,759
can i do junior dev on that because then

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,959
you expand your profile

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,160
and you do it while getting paid to do

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,040
it um look for the right fit for you

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
ultimately find your place in the sun um

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,839
you know

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
what where is it that you want to go i

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,199
feel that a job

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
is it's a partnership it's not a one-way

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,560
street as far as you

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,079
are getting paid to do this one thing is

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
it a right fit for you is it something

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,959
that you want to do and where you want

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
to be and how you want to grow

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
um that is also a really important part

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
of

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
this conversation that is an interview

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,720
what exactly did you do at your last

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,199
position or training school

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
and if you don't counter offer you are

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
selling yourself shorter than you think

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
i

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,120
am absolutely amazed at how many people

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
i interview who do

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,000
not counter offer ever

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,839
and it's important that you at least try

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,040
the worst they can say is no

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,240
and just know that once you've gotten to

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
the phase where they're giving you an

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
offer

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,800
they've already decided that they like

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,199
you um and so it's important that you at

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
least

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
explore the option of of you know okay

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
you want me

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,639
how bad do you want me um industry

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,000
standard is no more than 10

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,440
per interval of haggle so if you for

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
example are in a position where they've

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,839
offered you forty dollars an hour

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,839
try for 45 they'll probably try to meet

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,360
you in the middle of 42.43

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
but at least you asked and therefore

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
just by asking you got a seven percent

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
raise over what you would have gotten

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,720
and that

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
continues to permeate out throughout

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
your career if you hadn't gotten that

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
then your next job

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,199
you may come up even shorter and and and

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
so on and so forth

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,679
okay playing nice in the sandbox i think

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,559
that it's really important

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
that we understand um the concept of

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,679
what it is

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
um to play nice with others and that it

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,839
is a team environment and that

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
um you know it's it really isn't at the

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
end of the day what you it's not what

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,559
you know but it's who you know

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,320
um in in our field especially when i say

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,760
our field i say that in a very

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,120
uh high-level way um but in software

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
it's it rather regardless of what you

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,919
specialize in it's a small world for

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
those of us that have been around the

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
block especially we can tell you that

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,360
when we go to conferences and things

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,799
year after year we see a lot of the same

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,320
faces we interact with a lot of same

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,120
people and so

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,640
it's a small world and your reputation

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,160
matters and that's not to say that

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
you're going to get along with everybody

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,120
or

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
that you're not going to have projects

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,919
or people along the way that you just

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,600
you know don't for whatever reason uh

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,679
get along with but

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,679
overall your social skills are paramount

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
to craft mastery it is not in the realm

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,400
of when i get around to it or oh that

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,880
would be nice to have

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,559
if you want to be a truly successful

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,360
engineer in the long term

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
um you need to have good social skills

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,640
um

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,480
and all of the i can't i don't wanna i'm

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,559
not good at writing i've never done that

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
before i'm not good on the phone

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
it's just all of those things really are

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,480
it is a managerial nightmare

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,360
um and the more of those hang-ups that

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,520
you have

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
um the harder it is for me as a manager

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
to put you somewhere where you're going

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
to be successful and then

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
therefore ultimately the the less i can

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,280
utilize you

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
um and therefore the less you know it's

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,400
going to translate into less

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,400
opportunities for advancement and

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
ultimately less money likely for you

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,760
um because if you don't want to do it

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
okay i'm not good at writing right if

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
that's

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
if if that's your concept coming to the

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
table

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
okay but rfps and proposals that's how

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,919
we eat that's our bread and butter

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,440
somebody has to write in technical terms

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,720
to speak towards the approach that we

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,840
would hypothetically do

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,760
for our new bid or a new project and

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,600
ultimately that person isn't likely to

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,360
be the project manager or even proposal

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,640
writers because there's only but so much

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
depth that they can give

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
in not being an engineer so if you say i

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,360
don't want to write and i can't write

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
you don't want to do that who's going to

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,679
do it

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,640
i have to do it your cto or somebody

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,679
else has to do it so it has to be done

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,440
and so think of it within those bounds

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,880
so get to know your colleagues get and

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
get reference information

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,559
from them before you really need them i

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,000
encourage you as you get settled in

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,840
organization within the first

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
three to six months see if you can get a

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,440
good three to five

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,480
contacts and references get their emails

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
and their phone numbers

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,760
and see if you can for their personal

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
emails so that

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
um should you need a reference down the

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,559
line you have that because

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,240
in our world turnover is high we have

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,799
the highest turnover rate

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,919
of any industry now and so you have to

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,480
prepare for that

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,600
sad but very real concept that at any

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,520
time this can come to an

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,720
end and that your contract could end and

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,880
sometimes for reasons

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
well outside of your control maybe the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,919
overall budget for the whole

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
project got burnt burnt out and and

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,720
that's the end of it maybe they're not

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
happy with the product again maybe that

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
is

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
very something that you have very

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,000
limited control over um but it can it's

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,039
gonna it can happen and it's likely to

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,520
happen to you

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,960
um so plan accordingly it is the human

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
bond that is the strongest

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
not the project bond so find a good

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,320
mentor

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
along your travels look for someone for

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,919
whom you want to be like

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
and see about making friends with them

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,200
and interacting with them to guide you

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,039
through this

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,799
it will be a lot easier and you'll have

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,919
a lot more shelter from the storms if

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,760
you do

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
meetup.com is also your friend attend

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,480
conferences and meetups

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
make contacts and keep in touch with

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,760
them just reach out periodically

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,400
particularly if they're there in your

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,039
metro area go to those happy hours and

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
go to those

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
you know barbecues or whatever it is

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,159
make friends

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
it will be the easiest way for you to

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,039
get your foot in the door somewhere else

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,120
and have a sort of sentinel view of hey

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,720
so and so such and such is this really a

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,240
place i want to work

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
like let me know ahead of time if this

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,760
is really ultimately where i should be

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,440
working is the is the culture really

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,880
and engineers we talk you know to each

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,559
other or people or i should say project

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
managers to you guys also know

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,000
we all talk to each other in this field

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
so keep your ear to the ground

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
it was an easy way so that if things

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,159
aren't working out at your current job

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,000
for whatever reason

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
stick your feelers out you can usually

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,039
quickly much more quickly get in

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,159
somewhere else because you have an

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,000
advantage of a reference

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,679
okay so talking about the burnout factor

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
the burnout factor is very

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,000
real um it is you know we you know

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
not just because of the success rate or

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
failure rate

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,559
um of the projects themselves but also

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,919
because

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,440
um there is an inherent need uh

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
to fill these voids of these

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,880
applications in these projects but a lot

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
of them just don't work out for a

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
variety of reasons

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,240
uh 46 percent of all open source

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,320
projects fail within the first year

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
more than 31 percent of all web projects

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,360
that are started are canceled before

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
they make it to launch

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
um companies are estimated to invest

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,840
between 50 to 150

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
billion dollars per year year on failed

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
web projects and that number is growing

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
per year um and we do as mentioned have

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,520
the highest

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,159
turnover rate of any business sector in

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,159
in

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,760
the world right now higher than retail

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,120
higher than the food industry or the

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,000
restaurant industry

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
um they have a roughly 13 we have 13.2

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,240
percent and growing

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,200
um large it companies such as google i

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,960
always tell people

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,480
um they're often really surprised by

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
this but you guys know what the average

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,600
tenure is

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,360
for an engineer at what we call the big

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,880
five which moves around a little bit but

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,720
for all intents and purposes the googles

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
the yahoos the ibm's the oracles or

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,120
whatevers

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,039
the major corporate headquarters there

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,440
of um the average tenure

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,360
for an engineer is just 13 months that's

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
it that's all you got 13 months is the

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
average which means that

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
half of people aren't even making it

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
that far like so you see

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
you see how quickly people are flipping

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,600
in and out of our of our industry now

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,520
um and how common it is um and and to me

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,120
that's a really alarming thing because

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,640
we have some of the brightest minds we

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
have some of the biggest talent in the

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,799
world

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,880
um and so you as an engineer or for

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,520
anybody that's in the technical sphere

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
should be aware of that um because that

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,320
explosion of turnover is costing all of

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,440
us money time and stress

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,440
excuse me in a recent survey

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,360
one hundred percent of all the soft

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,039
engineers interviewed

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,559
we had that have more than five years of

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,880
experience day that they had

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,919
experienced extreme burnout with extreme

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
burnout being

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,080
um a very distinct feeling burnout is a

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
very distinct thing for anyone that's

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,600
experienced it you know

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,600
it isn't just tired or or a little worn

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,240
down burnout is like hitting a wall it

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
is like

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,080
everything has to stop and shut down in

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
order for you to recover

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,200
and it takes days it isn't something

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
that just a day or a good night's sleep

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
is gonna cure

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,679
it can take three four five six seven

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
days or sometimes even more

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,520
to fully get out of that mode and feel

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,279
back to yourself um

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,880
and so that's a scary thing to know that

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
you know in a five-year cycle every

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
single one of us

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,039
will be hitting that that factor um and

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
and the consequences are real from on an

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,480
emotional side of that

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,240
um you know it can it can triage out and

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
to triage out into the rest of your life

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,120
and that that's an even scarier thing

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,679
less than 25 of open source coding jobs

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,919
are

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,840
uh are going to women um and of those

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
women less than 24

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,279
will stay in the same field for life um

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,919
that means that

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,559
um of all the women coming in the door

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
um

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
of for if 100 women come in the door for

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,799
the software

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,559
um industry um out the gate as a career

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,480
less than 24 of them

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,960
uh will stay there by the time that they

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
retire that's really scary thing that's

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,360
heavy that's high

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,279
um so know that this is the landscape

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
and what you're up against i do this to

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,279
encourage you all to understand

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,640
where our market is and also sound an

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,400
alarm is to say hey guys

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
look at what's going on is this is this

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,200
the landscape that we want to paint

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,120
um is this where we want our field to be

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
um

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,279
so some sage wisdom from from my

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
perspective to kind of wrap this all up

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,679
and to kind of give you

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,039
some of the best points i can give you

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,080
as somebody that's been in the field for

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,000
20 years and

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,480
has all these this education and has

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,039
been at so many different web companies

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
um you know turnover is high and you

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,799
will very well experience it as i've

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,720
noted so get prepared now

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,559
i i think that the pandemic has taught

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
many of us that we cannot

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
depend on unemployment you you may or

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,159
may not get through to them your state

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,840
level government may or may not

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,919
be that solution to problems so you have

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,360
to save that money now and because like

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,559
i said you never know when it could come

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,320
to an end if you're contracting

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,559
especially or even if your salary

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,320
um so you can't bank on that and

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,000
therefore connecting with your peers and

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
finding the most stable environment to

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,960
work is paramount

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
in addition i would encourage you to

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,240
make friends with your recruiters

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,760
particularly the ones who

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,679
do successfully get you networked in

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,960
with work quickly um i have a network

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,320
with recruiters i've worked through over

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
the years that are my first points of

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
contact

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
and ultimately can streamline me into

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,279
something quickly because they know my

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,559
profile and have really good connections

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,960
um so know that that is also your friend

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,120
um within this within these bounds um

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,279
reliable tools equals reliable work

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,880
you need to get a working environment

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,679
that is going to allow you to be

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,840
successful

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,919
that includes a quality computer um and

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,679
a quality office setup

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,360
as well as all the relevant software

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,200
applications that you're going to need

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,360
to code successfully or or develop

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,919
successfully however you develop

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
it's tantamount and paramount to being

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,520
able to ultimately deliver

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,799
in a way that is reliable and ultimately

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,000
in line with

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,760
you know successful work your local

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
c-level executive has three minutes a

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,520
day for you i always enjoy explaining

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,480
this to people so that they understand

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,000
the math behind what c-level executive

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
life is meaning chief technology

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,039
officer chief marketing officer chief

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,520
executive officer

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,200
so in my world as noted i have 100 and

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,559
some active clients

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
let's say roughly half of those are what

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,799
we call super active meaning everyday

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,640
developers are doing something on them

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,679
let's say 60 to make it easy

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,720
um so 60 active projects a day i mean a

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
week

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,279
and then if 20 hours of my week as a c c

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,240
level executive goes to what we call

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,200
internal work so overhead talking to the

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,840
management team

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,760
proposals rfp writing sales engineering

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,559
so talking to prospective clients coming

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
in the door

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,640
trying to get more sales done anything

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,520
related to

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
marketing seo working with that team on

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,360
spiffing up our

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,799
our prowess so to speak um conference

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,399
planning all of that good stuff

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,480
let's say that that's 20 hours of my

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,240
week assuming i work a 40 hour work week

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,279
which is a c level executive is is quite

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,279
a luxury

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,399
um to have it's it's not always common

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,000
but

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,919
let's say that the other 20 hours a week

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,799
is what i have for projects okay

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,279
so 60 projects divided by 20 hours a

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,760
week

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,200
um that gets you down to 20 minutes per

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,159
week per project

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,520
um so not per day per week so divide

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,919
that by five days in a week

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,279
20 by five is four minutes a day i have

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
three or four minutes a day for you

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,799
that's the math that's my world that's

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,320
my role every single day of the week

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,080
and no i don't you know obviously i

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
don't i can't graduate my time that way

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
some projects don't need that much love

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,640
and or my attention i can ignore them

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,559
and some need more and therefore

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,159
it recalibrates the time but i say that

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,159
to tell you all understand how

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
fast your c-level executive is clocking

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
how much he or she

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,120
has going on at any one point in time

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
and that it is not all about you

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,440
um your organization and your managers

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,960
are here to fight a lot of those fires

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
for you you just have to give them the

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,279
ammo to do it

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,600
succinctly and successfully each time so

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,200
water it down try to condense it try to

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,840
give it to them in a way that

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,600
helps you all use them as a resource but

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
use them in a resource that has a short

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
time

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,399
as a short attention span if you're

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,559
thinking of freelancing or

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,279
doing entrepreneurship i encourage you

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,600
to do your homework first

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,440
get a lawyer very verified contract for

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,679
your freelance engagements as well

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
um that you can use because when you

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,440
become an entrepreneur

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,200
um i i ran my own business successfully

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
for a few years

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
and while i enjoyed doing it i got to a

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,720
place in my life where i was so burnt

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,159
out all the time that i just couldn't do

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
it anymore why because i was the

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,120
everything

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,480
i was the engineer of course but i was

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
also the project manager and the

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
accountant

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,919
and the collections department when

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,760
people decided they didn't want to pay

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,360
for whatever for whatever asset 9 reason

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,679
and all these other things

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,600
so it's a lot know that it's a lot and

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,399
plan accordingly so that you don't hit a

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,240
wall and that

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,080
you have much more strict boundaries

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
around what you will and won't do if you

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
don't set those boundaries

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,399
your job will set them for you and it's

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,399
often going to be in a way that you may

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,880
or may not like

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,559
um it's okay to switch special age

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,200
specializations or even

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,799
uh long careers all together uh whole

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
careers and think of your long-term

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,520
goals and periodically adjust them write

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
them down

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,200
it's okay to have those soul-searching

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,799
times and you will you may not want to

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
stay in the thick of engineering forever

00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
for whatever the reason maybe you want

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
to get into

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
sales writing or proposal writing and

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,480
that's their technical writing

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,240
maybe you want to get into more things

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,600
in the marketing or online digital media

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,360
space related to related to the

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,799
analytics and marketing data

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,559
maybe you want to segue over into

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,799
project management all of those things

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,960
are

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,080
totally okay maybe that's just where

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,640
your place in the sun

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,240
is uh particularly at that point in time

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
and at the end of the day

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,559
people will gravitate towards positive

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,880
people who do great work meaning that

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,480
your energy and what you know that whole

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,000
feel of your personality

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
is ultimately what's going to guide

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,279
people to you no matter what you do for

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,120
a living

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,120
and so just make it positive as much as

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
you can conan o'brien once said it's one

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,640
of my

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,360
favorite sayings is work hard be kind to

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,960
people

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,960
amazing things will follow

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,880
okay a few more points your developers

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,320
are the heart of your engine room so

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,679
please listen to them

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
they are going to have a much better

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,880
readout if you're not if you're a

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,799
non-technical creative person

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,000
as to what's going on what the trends

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,720
are and what's going to work best to

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,440
your system

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,000
the harder you fight against them for

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
whatever

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,120
political or financial reason the harder

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,399
it is going to be

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,720
for you to steer the ship in all

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,679
likelihood so try as you must to

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,000
as you can to listen to them um and know

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,640
that it's always better in my opinion

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
um to admit that you under bid a project

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,799
or admit that you're over budget

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,159
and have to just either eat that or go

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,320
back for a scope increase

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,320
than to go six or to nine months without

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,919
a tech lead on a big project because

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,600
you can't staff up quickly enough to get

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,600
them in um

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,039
turnover if you are in an organization

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,399
that has constant turnover

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,320
and if you're not doing a lessons

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,919
learned session you're going to keep

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
repeating the same mistakes at the end

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,039
of each of your project life cycles it's

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
important for you to do a lessons

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,679
learned

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,600
and try to make it as non-biased as

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,760
possible

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,039
when your hr department doesn't count um

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,240
you've got to do it in a way with your

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,519
project management team and a team

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,559
that's there that says what went well

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
what didn't go well

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,519
and don't point fingers about it it's

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,880
not about blame you know i tell people

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
it's engineering things break all the

00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
time i break things all the time too and

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,200
that's okay

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
it's not about that it's not always

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
about anybody's fault a lot of times

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,000
it's not about fault it's about let's

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,760
just make it better as an organization

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,039
so do those things so that you can then

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,120
learn from those mistakes

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,880
and make it better the next time give

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,080
your devs training i'm amazed at how

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
many companies are afraid to

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,159
invest in dev training anymore i think

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,840
it's a huge issue in our industry

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,200
that there's some expectation that devs

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,320
come to the table knowing all these

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
skills i don't think that that's

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
entirely fair

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,320
um i think that it's a co-partnership if

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,200
yes you need to know enough to get the

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
job done

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,960
but the more advanced things i think

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,480
there's a shared model of learning there

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,159
that that makes sense so

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,840
don't be afraid to train them if you

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,480
train them your results will inevitably

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
be better

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
so think of it as a small investment

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,320
some of this training you could have for

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,600
your entire

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,360
development group on certain things for

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,200
for a couple of thousands of

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,720
one or two grand um and that's a small

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,240
investment to have a team that

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,159
is both educated in what they're doing

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,399
but also wants to stay working with you

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,720
it

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,679
it invests it makes them feel invested

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,640
in your company

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,399
i've always surmised that part of why

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,760
turnover's so high is that number one we

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,279
don't have pensions anymore we're not

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,720
investing in people like it was during

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,039
our parents generation and so

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,320
there's more incentive to flip because

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,840
supply and demand is an issue there's

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
always a higher price tag right now in

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
it

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,120
because we don't make enough engineers

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,559
so i could always find a better or

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,880
greener grass to go to

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,960
probably for more money hence why people

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
flip but if you invest in your workers

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
even just a little

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,679
it gives them incentive to stay even

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,240
when the going gets rough

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,279
so think of it in those terms pms get

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
creative with your

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,559
with your options if money is your only

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,440
bargaining chip you're really selling

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,120
yourself short

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,640
there are all kinds of other things a

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,080
client can be for you and your

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,919
organization than just money

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
they can be a positive review for you on

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
google or whatever platform you want

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,120
they can be a testimonial they can be a

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
written reference they could be a

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,679
call-in reference for the next time you

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,000
get your rfp

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
they can be a review on yelp or whatever

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,399
they can be all of these different

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,480
things

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,840
and so utilize that as a bargaining chip

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,039
as well particularly for clients that

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,440
are right on the border

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,200
of financially making it um for whatever

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,200
sale you're doing throw those things in

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
as other chips to help you

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,440
prevent those more uncomfortable

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,320
conversations about money

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,399
con temperature check more more your

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,919
morale regularly is particularly

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
if your project managers are in

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,800
management um ask people how they're

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
feeling

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
i'm amazed at how many managers i've had

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,200
over the years that don't stop and say

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,280
how are you feeling and what can i do to

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,919
make you more successful at this

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,839
how can i help you i think to me that is

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,560
the hallmark of a truly great

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,240
leader is how can how can i help you and

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,240
if i have to fall on my sword to do it

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,159
then that is what i have to do

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,480
the energy from the top always echoes

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,800
out the more positive or the more

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,079
cohesive the more encouraging and

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,159
positive and

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,919
social the people at the top are the

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,879
energy echoes out the other side of the

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,639
coin is true

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,520
if the people at the top are uh you know

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,919
more conservative about their approaches

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,320
and

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,919
uh lessen in the weeds and and don't

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,000
really make their presence known in a

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,400
positive way to the organization and

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,440
give it a transparency factor everybody

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
else is going to kind of operate

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,240
probably very similarly as far as more

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,280
pigeonholed more quiet less

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,880
communicative

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,400
it matters it does permeate out um and

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,400
it is important that for you to

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,680
consistently have products that are

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,359
delivered of quality

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
um you've got to have quality control

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,560
processes so in other words

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,400
perfection is a fallacy perfection does

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,280
not exist in this world

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
but in order to get consistent delivery

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,920
overall

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,839
um you need to have quality control

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,200
measures in place for anything whether

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,599
it's project good project management

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,960
tools

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,359
whether it's development tools all of

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,240
those things require good

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,040
process control all right so in

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,599
conclusion

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,400
code is the foundation but communication

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,240
is really

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
um the difference between good and great

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
i think that it is communicate

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,200
communication that's ultimately going to

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,320
set an engineer apart

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,960
uh from being good or or decent to

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
truly great um experience almost always

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,800
trump's training

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,440
um you know there is no replacement for

00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
uh being

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,200
in the weeds and experiencing this for

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
yourself as well as from having a myriad

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,200
of other organizations

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,160
um i've been at over 28 different web

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,240
companies in my

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,000
in my 20-year career including some that

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,320
i had during freelance so i had multiple

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,920
clients at once hence the high number um

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,520
but it taught me more than i could have

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,800
ever learned if i stayed at only one

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
company so while there were some really

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,520
hard times

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,359
um throughout those those 28 different

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,760
companies and it wasn't always pretty

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,040
um i don't take it for granted and i i

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,160
think that it ultimately built me into

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,119
who i am and so i'm

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,880
grateful master your social skills get

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,480
good at writing do start now

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,320
if you are still using text message

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,240
speak in your everyday writing

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,800
i i'm telling you that that permeates

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,680
out into your actual career as well

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,880
so i can't put people in front of

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,880
clients

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,320
who don't write professionally it's a

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,760
huge problem in our world

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,040
even for support tickets right you've

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,599
got to be able to communicate what you

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,839
did

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
so think of that really hone in on those

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,800
writing skills

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,560
aim to acquire a new stack related set

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,839
of skills at least a moderate

00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,440
well every two to three years if

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,800
possible and that is something you are

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
likely going to have to work on in your

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,040
spare time

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,400
it isn't something your employer is

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
always going to be able to give you time

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,839
to do

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
in the in real time some places do but

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,920
it's rare

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
um or if you've been there a while they

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,200
may let you get away with that but um

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,440
think of you you're gonna have to learn

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,839
outside to stay on top of

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,760
um the craft itself learn from your

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,480
failure failures and take them in stride

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,560
and you know what

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,520
know when to see greener pastures if you

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,160
are

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,359
constantly fatigued constantly burnt out

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
you've had conversations with your

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,920
organization about how to make your

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
world better

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,240
um and you're just not feeling it um and

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,800
you're feeling the constant churn and

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,200
burn

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,119
um it you know what it's okay to say i

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,800
tap out it's okay to step away it is at

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,320
the end of the day just a job

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,680
um we can you can there will always be

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,880
another job there will always be other

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
clients there will always be more money

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,280
to be made

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
um we can't replace you though your

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,480
family your friends the people that love

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,359
you and care about you cannot replace

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,280
you so if every sunday night is putting

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,880
you into panic attacks about work

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,480
regularly outside of just quote

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,720
stressful season or whatever

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,079
um it's time for you to really have a

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
heart to heart with yourself about what

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,880
you want to do

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
either at that job or in career and in

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,280
general and that's okay that is okay to

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,280
do

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,079
all right so with that all said i will

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,520
that concludes the the talk and i'm

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,320
going to segue over into the

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,599
q a session now and i once again want to

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:33,839
encourage you to

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:33,839
check out our newest ebook on drupal 9.

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,200
all right i'm pulling up the q a chat

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
now

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,079
all right if you have any questions uh

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
please go ahead and post them in either

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,560
the chat

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,079
or the q a section um okay so what

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,359
specific questions you

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,480
i you recommend asking when interviewing

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,520
developers

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,079
um i think that it greatly depends um

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,400
on i think i think it greatly excuse me

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,160
depends on what you're interviewing for

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,560
um but i will also say that um

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,240
typically speaking um i i i think that i

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,560
would encourage you to ask them

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,359
about their previous experience of

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,320
course

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,320
um and ask them about what their both

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,640
short-term and long-term goals are

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,079
um but in specific terms and when i say

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,040
specific i don't just mean the coding

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,200
skills they want

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,119
to acquire um but ask them what their

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,880
long-term vision is do they want to be

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
an engineer for the foreseeable future

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,640
just like a mid-level or

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,079
junior level or do they wanna do they

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,560
have men leadership

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,839
qualities do they want to get into a

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,359
variety of other skills

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,640
some people are more generalists meaning

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,920
they're kind of a jack-of-all-trades

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,160
some are more specialist

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
it is really important to gauge that um

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,000
in our world for open source

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,560
specifically i would for me i have found

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,800
understanding the flavor of how much

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,359
back end front end or full stack people

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,119
are

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,960
versus what they say that they are on

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,319
paper is an important thing to try to

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
read out and sometimes you need another

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,560
engineer to do that in fact usually you

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,640
do

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,839
um but i've had a lot of experience in

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
recent days with people saying that

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,800
they're full stack or

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,800
and really they're more specialized in

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,480
one variant or the other which is okay

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,480
in our field that's becoming

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,160
it's a progression from full stack from

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,760
i did back end i did front end and it

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,119
was usually separated so it's and it's

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,240
going to take a number of years from for

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,839
more people to get there

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,520
but just kind of being cognizant of that

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,119
because once you get them in the house

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,240
it can be kind of harder if you thought

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,440
that they were full stack and they and

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,040
they really aren't you know

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,960
either one or the other as far as more

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,520
flavorful

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,200
um other questions what is your training

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,480
program for your employees as far as

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,440
drupal leveling up

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,040
um well that's a good question um drupal

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,400
is one of those ones where it

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,440
depends on where you started from um i i

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,400
think that acquia's certifications um

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,079
are a good start however um i i don't

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,839
find them to be cohesive

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,920
um and in the weeds enough for you to

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,480
have a full appreciation for

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
drupal in the sense of there's building

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,359
drupal and doing that within the lamp

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,200
stack model and doing it i should say

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,839
within the symphony framework for modern

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,160
times

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,119
but more importantly it's knowing about

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,200
how to do this

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,119
in a way that's sustainable to do that

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,200
you've got to get familiar with the the

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,400
most common modules that are in our

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,960
universe so that

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
if i say to you build a form you need to

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,599
know

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,680
what what that should be is it web forms

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,599
or is it something else you know and

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,520
that kind of stage wisdom comes from

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,560
just experience in the field

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,880
um so that's my drupal um

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,960
text i tell them yeah it's a combination

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,880
of um the certifications but also

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,599
frankly youtube videos work

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
um i know it sounds very kind of off the

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,520
cuff but youtube videos really do

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,319
work um and it is a way that even i

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,480
upskill

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
um and search google as well um you know

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
part of what i had to do and i helped

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,440
write the ebook that we just

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,720
put out um at nordstudio was it was

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
largely mine for the technical

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,119
components

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,720
um and it was a good chance for me to

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
learn what are the differences between

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,720
drupal 9 and drupal 8 how much money on

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,119
average is it going to cost for a client

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,800
to migrate up those are all things i had

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,920
to learn and so i too i have to learn

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,680
these things and i have to go under the

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,319
hood and download them and study them

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,440
and so

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
that's what i encourage you to do is

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,960
just get your hands dirty dive in

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,400
that is the best learning you will do

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,520
for content management systems like

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,800
drupal and wordpress

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,319
full stack a little bit different i

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,560
think that it that can be a little bit

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,839
more of just practice practice practice

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,359
so that's my advice um

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,280
do you have any tips for fighting

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,480
imposter syndrome um

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,520
i would say yeah that ultimately um

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,560
try not to doubt yourself so much

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,079
um in the sense that this is all

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,839
like there's no one right way to do

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,319
anything there's no one right or wrong

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,560
way

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,319
to do anything um and that's part of why

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,119
i tell people like if you are fired let

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,800
go

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,560
whatever you want to call it severed

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,599
like you know in america one one of

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,040
my best mentors once said um you know

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,839
you you are uh ultimately at the behest

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,720
of

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,160
um your environment and the project and

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,839
the people at that time

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,760
um and so if it doesn't work out it just

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,000
means all it means is it didn't work out

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,440
with those people in that environment at

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,880
that time that's it that's all it means

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,160
that is all that it means it doesn't

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,280
have to mean more than that otherwise

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,200
find your place in the sun

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,119
you could still be a kick ass engineer

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,760
and you have a perfect place just around

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,520
the corner

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,960
that is the perfect environment for you

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,560
to thrive so

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,079
know that you're know that as long as

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,880
you're trying your hardest and you are

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,599
learning that

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,040
that's a big part of it okay and i think

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,560
there's one last question

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,319
here um any particular advice for

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,599
engineers returning to the field after a

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,040
few years of work

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,720
as a technical writer on non-foss

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,720
projects um yes um

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,480
for engineers returning to the field

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,040
after a few years of work

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,880
as a technical writer i encourage you to

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,000
first get a view of the landscape as to

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000
whatever you were

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
developing on as a platform first see

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,440
where it's grown to

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
um and then ultimately do a test project

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,720
um i've found at least in my experience

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,400
it's kind of like riding a bike

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,839
um you never really forget but it can

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,960
take you a minute to like

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,359
readjust once you get back on it so see

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,839
if you know how particularly the ides

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,200
and how to code or how to engineer

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,359
study how that's changed because the

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,880
tools that you use are also evolving

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,720
very quickly i'm amazed at

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,400
you know in just five to ten years now

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,400
there's github desktop so that you have

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,680
guise for those things and

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,280
you know all these other elements that

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,000
can really help make your life as a

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,520
coder considerably easier

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,359
so all right i think that's it for

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,960
the questions and we're about out of

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,920
time so once again

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,400
um thank you so so much uh for attending

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,200
this

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,520
and uh this conference and uh it has

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,520
been

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,760
an absolute pleasure um as well as an

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,000
honor so again if you have any questions

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,240
