Abstract: Software development is a relatively young field. What is considered “beautiful code” one day can be an anti-pattern the next. What if there was a way to write software that is easier to maintain, quicker to write, and more consistent by taking some timeless inspiration from the more established, culinary world?

"Mise en place" is a cooking term that describes the planning and preparation to assure everything is in its place before we start cooking our meal. Similarly, the creation of shared component libraries or design systems can help us build out parts of our application in isolation. In this talk, we will examine how using this strategy can help everyone on the team utilize these same ingredients to build, discuss, and design ultimately better software.

We'll discuss how we can:

- Build a custom component library that will scale well for your team or organization
- Enhance your ability to efficiently test your components
- Check your components for accessibility issues instead of checking for issues at the page / app level.
- Automate common development tasks
