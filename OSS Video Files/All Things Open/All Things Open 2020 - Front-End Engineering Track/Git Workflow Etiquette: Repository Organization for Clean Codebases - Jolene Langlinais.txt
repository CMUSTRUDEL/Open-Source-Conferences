Abstract: Version control with git provides for powerful collaboration, whether it be a tight-knit tech team or a distributed network in an open source format. Still, proper care must be taken. Good quality software consists of, among other things, code which is robust, resilient, secure, and performant. These attributes are achievable by maintaining a foundation of good quality code and a solid history of documentation. Anyone should be able to join the process and easily figure out and track the status of the project.
