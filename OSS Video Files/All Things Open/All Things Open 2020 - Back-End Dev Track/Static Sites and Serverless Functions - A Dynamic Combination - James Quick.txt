Abstract: Static sites are growing in popularity, but many developers still question just how powerful they can be. As it turns out, there is an entire ecosystem of added functionality in the form of serverless functions.

In this talk, learn how to add dynamic functionality like email, text messaging, interacting with a data source, etc. to your static site using serverless functions. We will integrate and deploy a working demo that you, the audience, get to participate in. In this interactive talk, you'll learn that by using the right tools, there’s almost nothing you can’t do.

but i guess

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,720
we'll go ahead and get started and uh

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,200
we're going to start with

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,719
maybe not where you would expect and uh

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,080
we'll start with just kind of talking

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
about the fact that

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,840
uh static sites doesn't actually mean

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,400
static sites or probably at least not in

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,800
the way

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
that you think it does traditionally so

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
you hear the word static sites and you

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,320
might think of

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,080
something like this like a really basic

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
html page with just a header

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,840
and a piece of text you might think of

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
something like this which is still basic

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,320
but has links and a little like mouse

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,559
icon

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
and stuff like that or maybe something a

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
little bit fancier and you've got like

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,879
this blog layout with a sidebar and you

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
get your pretty

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,120
pink colors or maybe just maybe

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
you think of something so amazing like

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
this

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
space jam website which coincidentally

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,480
is still available

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
out there for you to go and look at i

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
don't know if it's spacejam.com or where

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
it is but you can

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
search and find it but regardless of

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,320
which one of these things you might

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
think of when you hear

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,640
static sites it's important to know that

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
the landscape of web development has

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,320
changed drastically

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
over the last 15 years 10 years 5 years

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
even the last year things move so

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,960
quickly

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
and so today's static sites doesn't

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
really mean what

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,640
it used to back in the day so welcome

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to this talk static sites and serverless

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,320
functions where hopefully

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
you will see just how dynamic your

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
static sites can

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
be when you pair them with uh the power

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
of serverless functions

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
so thanks everyone for being here i see

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
a couple of comments in the chat i

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
appreciate that it does

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,320
feel encouraging to see people

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
responding at least with a few comments

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,960
my name is james q quick and i am a

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
developer a speaker and a teacher and

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
i've done some combination of those

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,600
things for

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
about the last seven uh seven and a half

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,240
years or so

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
if you're interested in anything social

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
media or my website jamesquick on

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,640
everything twitter and instagram and

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
github

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,159
and jamesquick.com and i am

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
a actually developer advocate at

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
austzero and uh what i do you'll hear a

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
little bit about also

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
throughout this demonstration or this

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
talk but i do

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
a lot of content i do a lot of community

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
engagement and i help people use our

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
product and it's kind of the sweet spot

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,959
for me where i get to talk at

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
conferences like this

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,040
and i just get to be engaged with people

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
which is really what i enjoy

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
i also have the privilege of

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
representing another really cool company

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
in twilio

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
as a twilio champion or an ambassador

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
for twilio

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
so the cool thing is you'll get to hear

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
a little bit about both austiro

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,040
and twilio in this talk and how they

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
work together

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
so as part of this talk i need some

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,160
interaction from the audience actually

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,599
so

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
one thing that would be really useful

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
for me at this point is if you're

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
watching the talk

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
if you would tweet about it if you have

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
a twitter account and include the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
hashtag

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,400
jquicktalks and then my handle at

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
jamesquick

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
just a little bit of foreshadowing this

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
will be a part of the demo

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
so hopefully you will take my request

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,599
seriously

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,040
and go ahead and do that or otherwise

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
the demo is not going to work so well so

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,239
take a second

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
and give a short tweet just include the

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,920
hashtag and the

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,720
um in my handle there if you don't mind

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,640
so let's start by just addressing what

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
static sites are and you could

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
just like everyone else you could go to

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
wikipedia the source of all truth and

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
you could find their definition here and

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,560
a static web page

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,400
delivered to user exactly is stored in

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,480
contrast to a dynamic

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
page there's a few things that really

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
stick out to me

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,040
uh the first one is exactly as stored so

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,080
what this means is

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
in contrast to dynamic web pages is when

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
you make a request to a given page

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,959
there's no calculation being done on

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,680
that page there's an html file sitting

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,480
there

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,879
and then that html file just get gets

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,519
sent

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,760
directly back to you as the the consumer

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
or the visitor of a given website

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,840
in contrast to dynamic web pages or kind

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
of more traditionally server-side

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
rendered pages

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
a couple of different terms you can use

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,720
there

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
where there's some sort of calculation

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
going on

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
on the server so if you ask for a page

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
it might have to go to a database to get

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
the information that it needs

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
based on that information it will render

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,040
an html page and send it back to you

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,359
so that's the definition according to

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,600
wikipedia according to me

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,639
static site is a collection of static

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,160
assets

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
that are and maybe i shouldn't use the

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,919
static in the definition of static sites

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but a collection of assets that are

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,560
served directly from a server

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,280
or a cdn cdn being a content delivery

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
network

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
but basically what this means is you

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
have a set of files and html css

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,759
javascript files you can throw them up

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,680
on some sort of server

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,280
and then as the previous definition

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
stated those things are just sent

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,639
directly back to a user with no real

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,479
time calculation going on

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
so you think about these static sites

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
and you may be wondering like how would

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
you create these

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,440
well vanilla html css and javascript you

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
could use those technologies that you're

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
used to to build your static site

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
because those are the actual files that

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
go up there

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,680
you could also use a front-end framework

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,360
like angular reactor view

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
and maybe some of the people listening

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
now are uh maybe turned off or you're

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
kind of questioning how does

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
angular reactor view relate to a static

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
site well if you go back to my

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,160
definition

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
of a static site it's a set of assets

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
that you can put up or host somewhere

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
and those things get sent down directly

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,840
to a user

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
and that's exactly what these frameworks

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
do these frameworks are used for

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520
building very dynamic

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
web applications but at the end of the

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
day they have a build

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
process and you do an npm run build for

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
example the output of that build is a

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
static set of files that you then go and

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
host

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
on some sort of server so in my

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,360
definition angular reactive view are

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
all able to build static sites

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,919
so what if you have lots of pages those

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,000
things kind of work if you have a

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,800
handful of pages you have an about page

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
and a

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,199
um an info page or like whatever it is

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
but what if you have a big blog with

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
hundreds of pages

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
well you could create the individual

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
html pages yourself

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
but you're probably not going to do that

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
so your alternative

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,720
especially in the modern web is to use

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
what's called a static site generator

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,880
now the most common example uh use case

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
of a static site generator

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,600
is uh with a blog so you'd have some of

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
my dogs jumping around back there

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,479
with a static site generator uh building

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
a blog you'd have some sort of

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720
uh data source for your blog post and

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
what a static site generator will do

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
is that build time it will go and grab

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
the information for each post and it

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
will generate the static page for each

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,120
one individually

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
so this is really important in a static

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
site generator

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
world you still interact with a data

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
source not being intentional not to say

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,919
database necessarily more of a source of

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
data than a database

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
so you still interact with a data source

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
just like a dynamic site would if you

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,720
think about a traditional wordpress site

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
you visit a page

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
the server will go to the database to

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,199
get the blog information it will bring

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
that back and then

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,440
send back the html page so you still do

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
that sort of interaction but the

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
difference

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,639
is when that interaction happens

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
so let's take a look at comparing these

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
with a static site generator that

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
interaction the interaction with the

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,400
data source takes place at build time

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,800
the interesting implication of this is

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,039
anytime you add new content to your site

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
you add a new blog post for example that

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
then means you have to do another build

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,800
on your site because the only way you

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,240
see that content in your static site

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
is by going through another build

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
process

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
so some of the benefits here is speed

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
because these are not doing any

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
real-time calculation they're super fast

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
you're not having to maintain a server

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
which means you're a little bit more

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
secure there's less security risk to

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
think about

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
the development experience is really

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
great you check stuff into source code

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
it automatically builds and it's kind of

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
done and the ease of use again from a

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
developer perspective

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,879
with the things that i've worked on

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,080
there's been no easier way to get up and

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
started with a blog than this

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
so if we contrast that with a dynamic

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
site when do we interact with a data

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
source well we do that real time when

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
you make a request for a given blog post

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
again it's going to a data source

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
database

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
of some sort it's grabbing that

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,720
information real time and then

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,400
generating that page

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
and so the biggest implication of that

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
versus static site is that when you add

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
new content

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
there's no additional builds that are

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
necessary they will kind of

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,520
automatically be taken care of by doing

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,280
that real-time call to a data source

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,039
so the benefits here no extra builds

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
necessary and this has kind of been the

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
established strategy for several years

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,320
now you think about ruby on rails

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,800
you think about wordpress and your

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,479
traditional server side rendered pages

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,519
that's been around for a long time and

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,839
it's something that people are really

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,920
comfortable with

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
so a few examples of static site

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
generators if you're kind of new to this

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,720
world

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,560
i spend a lot of time in the react world

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
so there's next js

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
and gatsby and these things aren't

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,519
necessarily limited to being static site

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,440
generators they just can do that they

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,839
can generate static pages

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
so in the react world next and gatsby in

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,040
vanilla javascript there's 11t

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,279
in the vue.js world there's next and

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,959
gritsome and then hugo was go and jekyll

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
is ruby so there's all these different

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,560
ones and in this case you'll see more

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
about gatsby here in a second is the one

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,839
that i use in this demo

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
and all of this talk about static sites

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,000
and some of its benefits really gets

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,480
into

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
the idea of the jam stack now this is

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,519
not a jam stack talk necessarily but all

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
of this stuff is

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,240
hyper relevant to the jam stack and so

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,600
just kind of defining what this is i'm

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,360
sure you or you may have seen this

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
before you may not but java or

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
jam stands for javascript as the j apis

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
and the a

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,240
and m for markup and it's interesting

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
that jam stack is becoming such a

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
popular

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
thing right now i love the jam stack i

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
talk a lot about the jam stack

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
but the interesting aspect of this is

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,000
javascript apis markup none of those

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,680
things are new

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
those things have been around for a long

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
time we've used javascript for a long

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
time we've used apis for a long time

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,760
and we've used markup none of those

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
things individually are new

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,320
so the jam stack is really just a new

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
way of how we think about building web

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
applications and i think maybe with a

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,800
demo this will be

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
become a little bit more obvious of this

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
is not quite the type of thing that

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
you're probably used to

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,040
and the way we leverage or the way we

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,320
build out some of the functionality in

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
this application the demo that we'll

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
talk about

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,200
is with serverless functions that's kind

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,959
of the second half of this talk

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
and just the way we started off with a

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,560
misnomer in static sites not meaning

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,560
static sites

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
or not meaning static experiences for

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,399
example serverless functions doesn't

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
actually mean server less

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,920
what it means is you the developer me

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
the developer we don't have to worry

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
about maintaining a server ourselves

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
which is actually a really

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
nice situation to get into i don't know

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,959
if we have any server admins or anything

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,279
like that devops people in the chat

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,120
if you are let me know but those are the

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
types of things that developers usually

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,959
don't want to have to worry about we

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,600
want to write code and that be the thing

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,959
that we spend our time doing

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,399
so the really cool thing about

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,480
serverless functions and you'll see this

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,000
in a second is that you write a function

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
literally a function you include it in

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,079
your source code

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
and then for the most part magic happens

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,959
that function

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,200
in the demo that we'll see gets picked

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,040
up by netlify as the hosts

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
it automatically gets deployed behind

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,760
the scenes using aws lambda functions

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,240
and then that thing is there to be used

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,040
in as any other endpoint would be on any

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
given server

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,000
so there's a lot of magic that goes on

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
which actually makes the development

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,360
experience of these type of applications

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
really easy so we've talked

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,279
kind of in theory so far and i think

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,519
it's time to talk about what the actual

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,640
demo is i referenced there being a demo

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,959
here and i think this is the most

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
exciting part of this talk

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,680
so let's go ahead and break down what

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,519
this demo is and what i wanted it to be

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,800
is a site where i can track all of the

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,680
talks that i give

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,639
so as a speaker if you're a speaker if

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
you've given talks

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
in the past you've probably been in a

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,800
situation where you give a talk and then

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,000
you say hey i've got slides available at

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,360
so and so uh a little foreshadowing here

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
there will be slides available so you'll

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
see this in the demo as well

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
but i wanted to be able to track that

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
for the conferences and events that i

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
talk at

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
here's what i spoke about here's a link

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
to the slides here's a link to the

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,839
conference and that sort of stuff so

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,519
that

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
i could send people to that page and

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
they could see all the talks that i've

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
given

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,160
so a couple of uh requirements when i

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,839
thought about doing this demo i wanted

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
to easily host this thing

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
i want there to be static pages for my

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,240
talks i want there to be interactive

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
feedback

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
this is one of the big things that we as

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,839
speakers miss out on is actually being

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
able to get feedback from people

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
usually and during a talk or right after

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
a talk a couple of people in person

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
might come up and say hey

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
you did a good job but rarely do we have

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,279
people that are giving

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,800
actual feedback most of the people have

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,160
maybe something negative to say just

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,279
kind of walk away and go to a different

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
talk right after

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
so i would love to get some interactive

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,839
feedback from

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
people that have been in my talks i

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
would love to get alerts when new pieces

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
of feedback come

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
in so i know i can check and see what

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,680
those pieces of

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,240
feedback are and then i also want this

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,519
thing to be secure

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
so just gonna walk through and break

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
down the technologies that are used in

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,959
this demo uh first is gatsby

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
and uh this says here static site

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,800
generator but it is important just for a

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
branding thing and awareness to know

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
gatsby is not just a static site

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
generator but in this case i'm

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,600
using it to generate static pages for

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
this site

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,200
so there's your you're much more there

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,519
and what happens is i go

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,040
and grab at build time all of the talks

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
so all the information for all of the

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,160
talks we'll see more

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
about this in a second get all of those

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
pieces of information and then with each

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
one we then create a page

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
so at build time we're going to create

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,079
all of the individual pages for the

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,240
talks that i've given

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,600
and then interestingly we're using

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
trello here

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
as a database or a data source so uh

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
hands up

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
i can't see people but uh maybe a thumbs

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,480
up in the chat if you have

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
i see a raised hand from ryan thank you

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
if you've used trello before

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,199
usually people associate this and this

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,120
is how i use it as well

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,600
as a kanban board or something like that

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
to track your to-do items and things

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
but it has a really great api and it

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
already has a gui built in so i thought

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,839
why not actually use that as a database

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
or a data source

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,720
here and so what i do is when i add a

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
new talk

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
to my site it will add a new card to

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,000
trello and it will have the information

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
for it and then it will do some other

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
things behind the scenes that we'll talk

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,959
about in a second

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
so in addition to that i told you i

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
wanted to have feedback well this is

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
where really cool company in twilio

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
comes in

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,079
where when someone submits feedback i

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,079
want to then get a text message

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,760
or an email but in this case the text to

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,360
show me that someone's actually giving

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,519
feedback on this talk and i can see that

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,920
right inside of my phone

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
so twilio has a really nice api here

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,880
where you create a client

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
with your credentials and then you call

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
messages.create and you tell it

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,320
uh what's in the body who the from

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
number is and what the two number is in

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,079
this case it's sending the message

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
to me so that i get to see whatever that

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,920
feedback is

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
i like the positive comment from steve

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,079
thank you wow this is creative i have a

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,399
lot of fun with this demo

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
and next up i wanted to have some sort

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
of

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,279
really just kind of proving to you how

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,199
interactive a static site can be

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,920
so what i wanted to do is show recent

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,680
tweets by a given

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
hint a hashtag that we've already seen

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,959
before so if you hopefully are

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
participating in this demo and want to

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,760
see this take place in the demo

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,519
use the hashtag jquicktalks and then

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
include my handle at jamesquik

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,279
and we'll see those show up in a second

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,199
and again twitter has a really nice

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,639
api here where you can call client.get

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,320
and tell it what you want to search by

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,600
and then use the hashtag that you want

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,959
to search by it's actually

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,959
fairly straightforward which is nice

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
uh lastly your second to lastly i think

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,800
we're using os0 so i'm using this for my

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,160
application security and it's kind of

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,519
interesting the very first time i gave

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
this talk i didn't have any

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,680
sort of security uh tied into the

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
application so other people were

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,600
submitting talks and kind of spamming

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,040
uh my application now i've got all 0 set

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,839
up where i'm the only one that can do

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,839
that

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,000
and so we've got a really great react

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,079
sdk to be able to get hooks in here to

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
tell whether a user is authenticated to

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
trigger a login to log out that sort of

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
thing

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,519
now i see a question from brad what was

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
the hashtag

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,279
it's jquick talks

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
so hashtag jquicktalks and there'll be a

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,920
little shortcut here

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,920
that you can see in a second in case you

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,079
missed that again

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,440
all right lastly on the uh thank you

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
ryan yeah for including that

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
lastly on the technology side we're

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,240
using netlify so netlify is a great host

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,079
for static sites as well as a host

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
of serverless functions and i can't tell

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,560
you how easy this

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
is with hosting my site inside of

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
netlify

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,880
inside of my uh source code i'll show

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
you this in a second

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,320
i've got a functions directory each one

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,759
of those files is

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
just a function that you see on the

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,079
screen netlify takes care of the rest

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,519
netify grabs those files it hosts them

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
as serverless function and there is

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,399
they're available as an endpoint a

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,480
back-end api

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
just like any other full-fledged server

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,000
would be although i didn't have to do

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,319
anything special i just write code

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,679
and after nullify picks that up you can

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,120
see they've got their functions

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,720
tab here which will show that they've

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,360
gotten picked up you can see logs and

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
things like that

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,520
so if you're interested you can again

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
slides will be available later you could

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
search jamesview quick and talk track so

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
you don't need to copy this

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,520
whole link down necessarily but the

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,600
source code is available so if you want

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
to go check it out you absolutely can

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
but this is the point where we've talked

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
about what the demo is i think we should

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
just show it

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,720
and i think that would be kind of the

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
best use of our time so let me scroll

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,360
over

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,000
and let me start out at

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,520
talktrack.netlife.app so this is the

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
demo here

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
and this is live i would encourage

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
actually i would request for everybody

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,799
that is watching to go out and go to

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,320
this site and what you can see

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,840
is i've got a list of talks that i've

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,520
given so i talked about react and

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,200
serverless something similar a full

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
stack jam stack made easy

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,799
at uh devnation i've got a link to the

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,120
slides here i've got the date

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,400
i've got the feedback form so people can

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,640
leave feedback here

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
and so on and so on so that's really

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,919
cool now let me log in

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,440
we'll go through this login process here

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,600
and i guess i'll show

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,799
if i get a bunch of spam emails i guess

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
i'll just have to get rid of them no

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,520
one's really spammed it so far so i

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
think we'll be okay

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,039
so i'm logged in here and when i now add

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
a talk

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
or when i now that i'm logged in i can

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
see the ability to add a talk so

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
i got some of this information already

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
done uh this is

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,600
all things open as the conference

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
and the date i'm going to copy i always

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
forget the format but i'm going to copy

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,400
one of those dates and it's the 20th

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,400
and the slides are available here

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
got some little shortcuts in here and

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
the description is here

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,600
now before i add this talk i want to

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,720
show you uh trello

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
so inside of trello these cards are the

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,960
different pieces of information the

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
different

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,960
uh talks that i've given with all the

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,880
information required

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
that showed up in that home page when

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,080
you first pull it up hopefully you have

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
it up and you can see it yourself

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,000
so what i want to happen is when i

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
create this new talk it should then add

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
a new card

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
to trello so let's actually run this

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
let's do a submit i don't have a loading

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
indicator so hopefully it's going okay

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,720
now it's done

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
cool so that got that got added and if i

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
scroll down i now have a new card in

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,440
here that has title conference slides

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,960
date description it has all the

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,640
information that i need

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
which is fantastic that's exactly what

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,039
i'm looking for and now

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,080
if i go back to my home page and i

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,559
refresh

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,160
i would have expected to see that new

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
talk except for one thing

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
if you remember back to the idea of

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
static sites when you add new content it

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
requires

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
a new build so one of the cool things

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,080
that's going on behind the scenes if i

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,559
look inside of talk track

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
and i look inside of my deploys it

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,520
actually kicked off

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
an automatic build behind the scenes you

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,000
can see this thing is actually building

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,440
real time

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
and we'll give this a little time to

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
finish but in the code now

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,799
what i want to show you is a couple of

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
things one is

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,720
inside of my functions directory there's

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,880
a add talk function

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,320
now again in netlify you have the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
ability to just add one of these

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,120
functions

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,559
into your source code check it in and

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,679
netlify takes care of the rest of

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
actually hosting that thing

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
as a serverless function so inside of

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
here

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
you can see that i am requiring a given

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
permission

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
so for a logged in user i'm requiring

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
that they have a specific user so even

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
if you created an account

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,480
and tried to add a talk you would not be

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
able to do this because i'm checking

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,760
permissions in addition

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to the user being logged in so

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,640
authentication as well as authorization

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,760
at this point from there i grab the

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
information that i need

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
off of the body and i create the header

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
and the card content and then i call

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
trello

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,720
create card so that's where this card

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
inside of trello comes from is that api

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
call that you see there

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,200
but that's not all that happens i also

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
make a call to a url which is a netlify

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
build hook

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,840
so what that does is it calls to kick

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
off this build

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,799
in netlify behind the scenes so that's

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
how that thing got triggered

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,919
automatically to go ahead and rebuild

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
because there's new data that i want to

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
see on the site

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,120
so hopefully fingers crossed when i do a

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,559
refresh here i should now see this new

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
talk so here's the static sites and

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,120
serverless functions

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
at all things open and i can click on

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,440
this and go to this page

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
that actually is pretty cool now i want

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
to show you

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
what this build process actually looks

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
like if we look in the gatsby node file

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,159
you saw a little bit of a snippet on

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,919
this before

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,159
but i grab all of the talks from trello

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,080
so there's a get cards for list so from

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
that list i grab all the cards

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,520
i format those talks a little bit and

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,320
then for each one of them

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,400
i create the individual page so for each

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,320
one of those talks i've now got a static

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
page that should be super fast

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
again i don't have a traditional backend

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,200
i'm not maintaining a server i'm using

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,120
serverless functions

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,440
and i would say this stuff works pretty

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
well at least to me

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,039
so at this point a couple of things that

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
you might notice

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,600
actually question in in here from steve

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,840
what triggered your build to kick it off

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,760
that is the i'm gonna reorder these a

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,159
bit uh that is the call

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,159
to the netlify build hook so this thing

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,799
is making a post request to the netlife

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
build hook

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,039
something that netlify gives you and

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,760
then it's telling it to go ahead and

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,159
build

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,760
at build time it's going out to trello

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,200
and now grabbing all the information to

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,559
generate those pages

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
so it's automatically triggering the

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
build and then during the build it's

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
going and getting all the information

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,720
again from trello which is how

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
then you have these new pages that are

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
generated

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
so if you're on this page and hopefully

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,919
you are a couple things you'll notice

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,880
one i have a tweet jq quick talks button

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,080
i don't quite know why this doesn't seem

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
to be working if anybody

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
wants to share with me what i'm missing

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
on here please do

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,640
but it does include in the url you can

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,960
see the hashtag

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
that you would use in this demo so you

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,039
can go and do that

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,760
there um then the other thing to notice

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
and i've see

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
other people have already participated

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,640
in this so i'm going to do a risky thing

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,360
as a speaker i'm going to turn

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
my volume up to loud and hopefully show

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,200
you something cool

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
so if somebody can go in and leave a

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
piece of feedback

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,960
right now what this will do is that will

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
submit this feedback and actually i

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
think this is

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,760
kind of a cool little rating system here

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,280
that i built but if you can leave a

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,919
piece of feedback real time

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,080
like right now hopefully what this will

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,039
do or what will happen when you do is it

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,240
will call the add feedback function

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,840
it will check it will grab the

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
information it will check to see whether

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
or not

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
i want the text alerts to be on which in

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,559
this case they should be set to true

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,240
and then if they are it will send me a

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
text message so hopefully

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
i already got one but it was before i

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
turned my my volume up so you won't have

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,559
heard it

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,159
but if someone can send me one in the

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,440
next few seconds hopefully you'll be

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
able to hear that

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,120
but all of that is kicked off through a

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,720
serverless function so when you click

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,080
submit it's going to send it off to that

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,760
serverless function this thing

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,440
will receive that information and then

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
handle the submission

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
of or the sending of the text still

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,960
waiting on sometimes it has a little bit

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,679
of a delay

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,960
so a comment from ryan about the

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
button i think i just got one but it

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,080
didn't sound off okay unfortunately it

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
didn't sound off but

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,080
if you can see that at all uh that piece

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,679
of feedback is coming through

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,320
okay and has uh now they're actually

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
coming through

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
still not i don't know what's wrong with

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,840
audio but a lot of these are coming

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
through

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,159
and uh the one interesting thing that i

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
think i saw someone uh show

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,600
is that they're sending uh some

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,760
crosslight scripting stuff they're

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,760
trying to inject a script in there i'm

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
not displaying these pieces of feedback

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,120
anywhere

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,559
so if i look at your feedback these are

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,400
not becoming html

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
so i think someone said sorry i won't

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,679
try to show your

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
email but someone included a script

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,720
there that won't be displayed so we

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,600
should be okay there

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
i'm gonna come back to ryan's uh message

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,840
about the url

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,559
something about the formatting hopefully

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,440
will be updated uh but there we go

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,880
hopefully it's okay for now the other

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
thing that i want to show and this is

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,279
kind of the last piece of just showing

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
you how

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,080
hopefully dynamic static sites can be is

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,000
that interaction with twitter to start

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,760
so if you've interacted with twitter in

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
the sense of using that hashtag even

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
though that button is broken so i'm

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
sorry

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
but using that hashtag and then

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,360
including my handle what it will do is

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,840
it should show these things now

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,679
inside of this tweet section so this is

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,360
not quite real time this is not going

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
out and continuously polling what it

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,520
does is when i

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,200
load this page on a static site you

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,159
still have the ability to run javascript

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
and now i can see

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,000
here are the comments or tweets that

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,760
have included that hashtag

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,600
and so what happens here is the

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,200
another function here for search tweets

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,799
this is a serverless function and i

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,480
guess i'm still logging these out

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
or logging out searching tweets i don't

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
really need that log but i'm checking in

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,159
here

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
to do that same code snippet that you

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,279
saw before where it's doing a search

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
tweets and then it's just hardcoded to

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,880
that jq quick talks

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,799
and this is in a static site where

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
you're able to run javascript real time

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,400
and query these things and get this

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,039
information and display it which i think

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,039
is pretty cool

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,400
so i'm going to hold off on a couple of

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
questions that i think

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
um i'm gonna hold off on these questions

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,120
and we'll just discuss them

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,320
just fully in the next like two or three

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,600
minutes because like this is basically

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
all the demo i want to show so we'll

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,840
move pretty quickly

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,360
to the uh to the questions here in a

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,679
second

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,880
but all of that stuff all these dynamic

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,480
capabilities at least from my

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
perspective being pretty dynamic

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,159
being relatively not necessarily real

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,559
time although it could be if i

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
implement in polling able to tie in all

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,320
of these different things with static

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,880
sites and static pages and all of that

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,960
sort of stuff

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,880
so we've got feedback we've got

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,559
we've got twitter we've got automatic

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,600
building of our site we've got a lot of

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,080
stuff going on

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,520
so a couple of resources as we leave one

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
is the source code so if you want to

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
check out the source code and see

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
all of it behind the scenes you

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,720
absolutely can

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,080
i also have a reactant serverless course

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
so this gets into

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,360
how to use serverless functions inside

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,960
of netlify

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,960
and doing the same sort of stuff that

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,039
you saw on this demo uh you can check

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
out that course at jamesquick.com

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,200
courses you can see that course listed

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,760
there and a couple of additional things

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,600
uh if you're well one i would appreciate

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,679
some feedback so real feedback

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,799
and this is a slightly different way for

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,320
you to give this feedback

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,159
but if you do you have the opportunity

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,960
to get some free swag and an osteo

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,559
t-shirt

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,000
so if you don't mind if you have time if

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,480
you have feedback i would love to hear

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
it

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,960
at a0.2 dot to feedback dash

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,320
jq uh if you fill that out and tell a

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,000
little bit of information about

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,679
you just like general things about you

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
as a developer you'll have the ability

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,720
to get an aussie or a t-shirt and i

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
would appreciate the feedback and it

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
would be good to

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
see just people being engaged from this

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,640
talk so you can go check that out if you

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
also have questions on the

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
serial side you can message me at

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,720
james.quick allcero.com

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
also if you were interested in the

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,919
slides you could go to two places you

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,320
could go to the demo site that you're on

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,559
now the talktrack.netify.app

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,799
i also post all this stuff on my own

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,640
personal site at jamesquick.com

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,000
talks you'll see the most recent talk

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,559
which is this one and you can go and

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
grab the slides from there as well

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,919
and then lastly uh thanks everyone for

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,760
being here especially for participating

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,360
in the demo this doesn't do a whole lot

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,640
if people aren't interacting so i

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,159
appreciate your interaction

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,080
and your questions and i guess that's

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,760
kind of uh the point that we're at now

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,360
we're actually doing really well on time

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
so 15 minutes four questions

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,279
and i think what i'm going to do is just

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,679
kind of scroll back up to

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,399
one that i missed from tom and start

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,240
there

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,600
and then feel free to throw additional

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,159
questions in the chat as i go through it

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,840
so tom asks what about the user

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,480
experience while the new entry is being

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,799
rebuilt

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,320
and not available in the list ui how do

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,960
you let them know

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,559
uh their operation was successful but

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
that the presentation is still being

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,840
updated that's a great question

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,840
so one of the things that you could you

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,919
could do is like you could do a

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,279
feedback message an alert message of

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
some sort to

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,039
uh to myself like in this case i'm the

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
only one that's uploading talks so i'm

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,399
the only one note that

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,520
knows that something could be going on

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,279
so you could do a little feedback

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,200
message if i were allowing other people

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,880
to do this just to say like hey

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,799
your your thing has been submitted

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,600
correctly uh it's building it'll be

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,799
available in a couple of minutes another

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
interesting thing

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,279
you could do is i saw this there's like

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,559
the lollipop let me actually pull this

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,880
up because it's a really cool

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,880
demo lollipop jam stack i don't even

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,000
know what to search exactly

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
uh let's see the pre-generated uh jam

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,159
stacks this is from

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,559
uh field hawks phil hawksworth a really

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
cool

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,919
great demo and what he does here is

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,240
uh he lets you generate static pages for

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,960
a lollipop so you pick like a top middle

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
and a bottom

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
part to your lollipop and you put them

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,440
all together and that's your lollipop

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
and it will when you create it it will

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
kick off that build process and look to

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,039
get that thing added to the site

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
in the meantime if you share that link

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,320
with someone

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,600
and they try to access that lollipop if

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
it doesn't find it

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,279
already as a static page it will go and

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,080
grab that information dynamically out of

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,080
the database

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
and then render that page appropriately

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
which is wildly cool because you have

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,360
this

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,880
this interim state of when you're kind

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,159
of waiting on the thing to be rebuilt

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,080
you can still get it it's

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,600
just not coming from a static page and

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,559
then when that static page is actually

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,240
finished building

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,000
and it's available you can go and grab

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,799
it just like you would have expected to

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
originally

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
so there's some tips and tricks and and

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
kind of a little bit hacky things that

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,200
you can do

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,880
and that's kind of the nature of the

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
the um the way static sites work i guess

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,760
overall is

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,200
is what i'm trying to say and and that's

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
okay because

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
you're not going to use them in a

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,279
scenario where you're constantly

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,799
updating data

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,640
if you use it for a blog if you use it

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
for in this case the list of talks that

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
i give

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,519
i only add a new blog once a week or so

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,360
i only add a new talk once every couple

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,480
of weeks right so i'm not doing a bunch

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,600
of real time

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,039
up uploading of information so anyway it

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,559
fits really well for this example it

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,240
fits for lots of examples

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,000
and there are some some interim things

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,000
you could do to give a better

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,559
uh user experience but also know that

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,240
like if people didn't upload that thing

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,679
they don't know that anything's going on

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,200
so just when it's available they will

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,960
see whatever that next

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,880
piece of data is so question from steve

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,679
how much does this cost cite you

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,679
or how much does this site cost you at

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,799
netlify small enough under a free tier

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,679
absolutely this is

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,159
uh yeah i've never paid and you can see

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,200
on

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,919
my netlife when i scroll back up to my

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
team

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
look at all these demos and sites that i

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,360
have here i've never paid a dime to

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
netlify

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,320
and i think that they've really done

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
this right where they give you a lot of

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,760
leeway as a developer to build whatever

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,799
it is that you want to

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,559
a really really good free tier

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,159
and if i got to the point where i needed

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,840
something paid i would be happy to pay

00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,039
netlife to do it because of how amazing

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,399
they've been so far

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,760
so i think they've really nailed this

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,399
with really just getting developers

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,159
involved

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,080
developers then take those conversations

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,919
to their jobs and then jobs start using

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
nullify and start paying

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,799
money for whatever features and scale

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,799
they need so i think they've really done

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,919
this right

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,279
a question in q a how to manage uh

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,760
different environments

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,559
like environment variables uh different

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,240
um

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,600
different static pages sure so i

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,120
i don't know if this will actually i

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,559
think this will show my credentials so i

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,679
probably need to be careful

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,159
but inside of that life in your

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,880
site settings under deploy build and

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,320
deploy

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,840
there's environment variables here so

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,279
you can set environment variables just

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,480
like you would anywhere else you could

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,600
have them be different

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,960
while you're running locally i have a

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,399
env and a env development those

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,760
are not necessary anyway those are set

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,960
up for different things right now but

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,480
you could use these

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
in any way that you want to and you can

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
have your different environments you can

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,399
also do

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,880
like staging environments inside of

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,399
netlify based on a different

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
a different branch so actually a little

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,840
fun fact here on my personal page

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,760
jamesquick i've got

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,200
develop.jamesquick and anytime i push

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,200
something to my develop branch it will

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,640
automatically do the staging here

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,640
i don't think i have anything that's

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,000
changed i think this is all kind of

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,120
up to date but you can do that

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
inside of netlify as well so

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,200
um how does localdev work with this

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
setup uh steve do you have any specific

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
questions

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,960
it like i run gatsby develop or actually

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,480
sorry i run netlify dev so netify dev

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,559
lets you run your serverless functions

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,399
as well as your front-end application

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,480
so that allows me to run gatsby develop

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,519
and my serverless functions at the exact

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,360
same time

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,840
and that takes care of all of it it's

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,640
it's really really cool the way it works

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,080
so i highly recommend using it i know

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,840
like if you do next.js

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,519
and and you use versailles for hosting

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,000
like they have a similar thing

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,080
uh nexjs has your api routes and stuff

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
already kind of like really built in

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,840
the only thing that you have to do with

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,279
netlife is give it a configuration file

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,120
to just tell it where

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,720
those functions actually live so in this

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,240
case i'm just specifying

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,320
where my functions well they actually

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,000
live in a directory called functions

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,720
and again netlify takes care of the rest

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,839
which is really really neat

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,280
uh so question about from unes uh the

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,960
money that is the question what about

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,639
twilio or trello well

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,159
i'm not paying money for either one of

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,720
those uh with

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,320
true trello uh you can like i don't know

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,760
what the free tier is exactly but you

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,280
can have a ton of information

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,200
in trello and if you look at the amount

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
of times that i've given this talk it's

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,399
been about 10 total

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,079
so it would be a long time before i

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,639
would actually hit any sort of limit

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,399
inside of trello so i don't really have

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,639
a whole lot to worry about there

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,919
the other case is twilio and i can't

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,440
remember right offhand what like the

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,679
free tier will allow you

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,200
um but at least for this demo i haven't

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
paid any money myself

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,960
and you might get into the point where

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,400
um depending on what your scale is like

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
maybe you don't need the text message

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
alerts it's okay if you if you don't

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
need them

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,920
i think it's just kind of cool to add

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
here but yes at a certain point you

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
would

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,680
break out of a free tier for any of

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,200
these but i would say they're all pretty

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
generous and i haven't paid any money

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,079
for the specific demo and the things

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,720
that you've seen here

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,320
hopefully that answers that question

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,320
does nullified dev

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,839
play nice with scully angular static

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,320
sight generator

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,320
i'm not a hundred percent sure um but i

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
i think the answer is yes and the reason

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,280
is

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
basically what nullified dev does it's

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,240
gonna do

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,800
something to the extent of looking in

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,119
your package.json file

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,960
and running a command so assuming

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,240
there's like a skully develop i don't

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
know exactly what it is but it's

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
something like that scully start or

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,760
skully develop

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,079
that's what the gatsby developed command

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,320
is

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,839
right so this gas we developed has the

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
built-in live reloading server and it

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,760
goes through the build process and all

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
that stuff

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,359
so what nullified dev does is it will

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
just literally run one of those commands

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,800
and then it will also run the serverless

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,560
functions and then it does some proxying

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,000
behind the scenes so it seems as if

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
they're running on the same domain the

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
same port

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,240
and they can talk to each other without

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
cross-origin issues so i don't know this

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
for a fact but i

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,800
i can almost bet you that netlify dev

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,400
will play nice with scully

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
because netlify's dev is pretty

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,079
abstracted away from whatever the

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
front end or the the framework is for

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,640
the front end

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,160
um it's pretty abstracted away from

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,119
whatever it is it just needs to know how

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,920
to call

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,359
a specific command that will do that run

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
now it is smart enough

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,119
i've never specified that it should run

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,400
this develop command i don't think

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,119
that's not in my

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
or maybe it looks in my netify go away

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,480
now if i time all

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,920
no that's the production command yeah so

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,040
it's it's smart enough to kind of

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,200
realize that stuff

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,359
on its own i don't know if it's smart

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,880
enough to realize skully on its own i

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,320
imagine it is

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,320
from the reasons that i just said but if

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
not i don't know this either but i'm

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
assuming you could also tell it

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,760
what command to run alongside of the

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
serverless functions and then be good to

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,839
go that way

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,839
hopefully that answers those questions

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,440
all right we've got uh we've got eight

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,000
mi i think i assume the original time is

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,839
still the same

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,680
45 minutes we've got eight minutes if

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,599
anybody else has any questions wants to

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,480
see a snippet of code

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,520
wants to share how their day has been so

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
far

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,880
how would the rest of the talks been

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,359
today by the way any uh any good ones

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
that people saw

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,400
oh hey james this is bryce to moderator

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,520
you have as much time as you want your

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
last one of the day

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,240
okay well yeah and i don't think we'll

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,560
take more than that but i appreciate it

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,400
thank you

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,560
or maybe we will we could do like three

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,839
or four more talks together

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,079
just kidding i'm gonna be done after

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
this

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,000
cool uh steve thanks for the feedback i

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,520
appreciate it

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,200
did someone say all nighter from ryan

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,839
yeah we can hang out here and do this

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,839
all day

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,520
well with not holding people up and

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,880
um being respectful of people's times i

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
think i think we'll probably just call

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,760
it

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,680
if anyone has any questions i think i

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,359
left uh kind of contact information and

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,359
stuff up here slides

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
at uh at my site uh check out the

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,160
feedback form and

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,760
uh you could leave feedback in a couple

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,119
of different ways either way is great

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,880
but if you want to

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,400
also try to get an osceola t-shirt you

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,200
can do that on this link here

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,160
email me at james.quick at allzero and

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,480
then jamesquick

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,720
on everything youtube instagram twitter

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,400
all that sort of stuff

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,119
uh maybe last question here any other

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,359
uses you have given to this topic

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
uh yeah i've done lots one of the ones

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,839
that i'm pretty

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,680
proud of that i've been working on

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,320
recently is dev setups

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,839
so this is using similar technologies

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
this is and ryan has been involved in

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,599
this

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,000
so this is kind of good timing for him

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,680
to be here this is a way for people to

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,280
upload images of their desk

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,480
and a way for other people to kind of

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,079
scroll through and see what other

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
people's desk setups look like

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,839
and i made some progress in just design

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,560
here yeah ryan this has changed a little

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,680
bit

00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,680
but i think it looks really cool it's

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,200
got the masonry layout you can go and

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
see a little bit more information about

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,359
a person just kind of their twitter

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,359
