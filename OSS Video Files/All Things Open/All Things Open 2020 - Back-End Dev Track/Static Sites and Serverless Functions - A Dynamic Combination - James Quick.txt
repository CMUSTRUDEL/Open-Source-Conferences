Abstract: Static sites are growing in popularity, but many developers still question just how powerful they can be. As it turns out, there is an entire ecosystem of added functionality in the form of serverless functions.

In this talk, learn how to add dynamic functionality like email, text messaging, interacting with a data source, etc. to your static site using serverless functions. We will integrate and deploy a working demo that you, the audience, get to participate in. In this interactive talk, you'll learn that by using the right tools, there’s almost nothing you can’t do.
