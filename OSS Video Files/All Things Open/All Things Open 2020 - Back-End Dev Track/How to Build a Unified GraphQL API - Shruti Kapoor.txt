Abstract: GraphQL is an open source query language for APIs. It allows clients to request a structure of data, and get an exact representation of that structure back without any extra data. This helps to prevent sending excessive payloads of data to the client. This feature of GraphQL makes it a lucrative option for implementing a unified API that integrates two or more downstream GraphQL or non-GraphQL APIs. In cases where a client may need to interface with an enterpriseâ€™s API, a unified GraphQL API can provide a single endpoint that abstracts away any unnecessary data yet curates results from multiple APIs, thereby making it easy to evolve multiple APIs over time. 

In this talk, I will be talking about the motivation behind creating a unified GraphQL API and show an example of how to create a unified GraphQL API with Hasura.
