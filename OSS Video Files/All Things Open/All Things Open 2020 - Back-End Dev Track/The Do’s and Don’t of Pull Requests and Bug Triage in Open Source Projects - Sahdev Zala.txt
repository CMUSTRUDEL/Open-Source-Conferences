Abstract: Contributing to open source projects, particularly creating new Pull Requests (PRs) and managing bugs, can be exciting and rewarding for any developers. A well maintained open source project may have specific guidelines on how to contribute, report bugs and submit pull requests, however, certain practices are accepted as the best practices across most projects; for example, addressing a pull request review comments with a new Git commit instead of the common mistake of amending a previous commit. In this talk, Sahdev Zala — Kubernetes cloud provider subproject owner, maintainer in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) etcd project and core reviewer in OpenStack — will provide a walkthrough of PR workflow and show what are the things you should do and equally important what not to do.
