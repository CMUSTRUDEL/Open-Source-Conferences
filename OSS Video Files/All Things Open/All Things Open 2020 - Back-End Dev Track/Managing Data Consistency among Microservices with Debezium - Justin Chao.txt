Abstract: Microservices are quickly becoming the trend in cloud-native application development, providing services that are more agile, scalable, and resilient. However, how do you ensure data consistency across your microservices, while maintaining a healthy amount of independency across service boundaries?

Debezium is an open source distributed platform that captures row-level changes in a database, using Apache Kafka Connect compatible connectors. By subscribing to these change-event streams, data changes can be propagated to other services for further processing.

In this session, the audience will learn about Debezium, and how it supports scalable microservice architectures and the propagation of data and data changes amongst services.
