	00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,720
uh

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,280
so thanks everybody for joining um this

my third all things open actually i'm a

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,799
big fan

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
of this show as well as the uh related

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
open source

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,680
101 and this is the second time that

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,160
i've delivered

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,000
uh this presentation at an all things

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
open so thank you for the

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,840
uh encore opportunity i did a i did give

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,439
it a fresh coat of paint it's not

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
exactly the uh the same presentation

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
that we delivered

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
last time uh but it kind of the spirit

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
of it has definitely remained the same

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,879
it is very much a one-on-one talk

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,719
uh for kind of linux beginners people

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
who may be interested

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
in getting into the operating system and

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
maybe uh don't really know where to

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
start

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
or kind of want uh some more ideas kind

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
of how the theory of the operating

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
system itself so let's

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
let's just dive right into it um i'm on

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
full screen so i probably can't see your

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
questions uh

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
in the zoom but i will try to take some

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
time to go and view them in the chat

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
after we get through this a little bit

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
about me i am the chief architect at

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
open logic my name is justin riak i've

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
been

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
working in various software roles for a

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
little over 20 years at this point

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
focused on a lot of different things

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
actually throughout my career spent a

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,479
long time working

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,119
alongside enterprise integration work

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,400
i did a lot with like messaging stuff

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,479
activemq

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
camel that kind of thing i have a number

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
of talks on that

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
uh nowadays i really mostly you know do

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
evangelism of our own

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
open logic product as well as this type

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
of thing a lot of uh

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
public speaking i really enjoy uh kind

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
of evangelizing individual

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
free software products uh that i've

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,600
worked with and that i've helped my

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
customers

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,720
uh use and consume in the past

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
and so this is kind of what i do so i

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,399
have to say you know this is probably my

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
fourth or fifth virtual event this year

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
and and

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
and thanks everybody for first of all

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
for for putting these on thanks all

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
things open we we

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
recently hosted our own event i know

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
that that this is

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,920
it's hard right it's hard to get the

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,840
engagement it's hard to to know how the

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
platform is going to perform

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
this seems to be going really well i've

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,599
seen a lot of engagement so

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
um you know just as a person who does a

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
lot of this kind of thing and a lot of

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440
the public speaking and a lot of these

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
types of events

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,239
thank you all things open

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
congratulations the event seems to be

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
going really well i hope everybody's

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,319
enjoying

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
it and thank you for everyone's patience

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,080
and and kind of bearing with

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
all of us as we kind of try to try our

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
best to

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
to be a community on sort of this new

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,720
new format where we're all kind of

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,840
persisting so okay enough with that if

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
you if you feel like adding me on

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
linkedin feel free i'm

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
pretty open to that i'll definitely

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,879
accept your request um

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
all right let's just dive into it uh

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
well before we do that small plug

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
the company i work for is openlogic we

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,800
help

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
uh enterprises adopt free software in a

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
number of different ways

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
uh and so really it's just related to

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,400
this because i've had

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
exposure to enterprise linux uh running

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
within

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
a bunch of different use cases a lot of

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
our customers are fortune 100 fortune

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
500 so

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
you know we've really seen free software

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
and linux at scale

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
and that's kind of what we do and that's

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
the closest thing you'll get to a sales

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
pitch for me for the rest of talk i

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
promise

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
all right uh before we can really look

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,800
at the origins

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,400
of linux we need to take a bit of a look

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
at the history of unix

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
which is the type of operating system

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
that linux was sort of modeled after

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
okay uh so this was uh invented at bell

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
labs

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
uh and it was back then it was used for

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
you know big

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
um like closet size mainframe machines

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,680
and stuff like that

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,799
um and it was a useful operating system

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
uh it was really close to the hardware

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
and it ended up splitting into what

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
would become bsd unix from the berkeley

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
software

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
uh foundation uh which would then split

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,959
into like

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,640
sun os um and uh the server five linux

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
hp ux and all this these were all

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
commercial variants of unix that were

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
used kind of in the

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,200
earlier days of doing this type of

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,959
computing and

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,920
you know alongside this you had

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,720
the free software foundation and the gnu

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
project

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
which was you know kind of this

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
foundation that was trying to push

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
uh free software and they hesitate to

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,880
even call it open source as you'll see

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,960
they truly mean free no drm no licenses

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
except for the gpl license everything

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
has to be copy left

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
truly free free software i'm a big fan

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
of this foundation by the way

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,000
and they are the foundation that would

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,720
uh kind of grow to sponsor

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,320
uh linux as we know it today so but as

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
you can see i mean unix is branched out

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
into

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
all of these recognizable forms even

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
even now and i should probably extend

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
this timeline a little bit but

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,320
you know ios on your iphone android on

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
your android phone all of these things

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
find their roots in early bell labs unix

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,280
right it really comes from there

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,320
uh here's a system five hp ux machine

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,759
um hp commercial unix machine

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,840
but for anybody who's booted linux

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
before uh this doesn't look too far from

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
from what you see now

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,360
in a typical boot screen okay

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
uh so linux then versus unix where did

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,880
it split off

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
well um you know in in early days of

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,680
free software

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,520
um you know circa early 90s um

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
you know you had a lot of these hobbyist

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,479
forums unix hobbyist forums and stuff

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,520
like that

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,800
um and you had

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
uh this guy uh lena storval who was

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,280
gonna push a little hobbyist

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,680
uh version of unix

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,039
[Music]

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
called minix at the time a small

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
stripped down version of unix he was

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
going to push a little fork of it

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
and called it linux and it was just a

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
hobby project it wasn't ever

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
really supposed to be a big deal um but

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
of course as we know it became the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
biggest

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
operating system and possibly the most

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
disruptive force

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
uh in software as we know it and

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,639
certainly i think the uh

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
the most successful free software story

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
ever told

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,840
and so it began with this hobby project

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
uh and then it just kind of grew you had

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
people forking it

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,880
you know kind of early understanding of

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,800
community software and the power of open

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
source and free software

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
you know you had a uh the debian fork

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
become

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
you know really a a separate flavor of

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
linux and we'll talk about what flavor

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,039
means in a second um

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
that you know kind of uh became its own

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,680
brand and then

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
you know shortly thereafter you had red

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,479
hat who was already a software company a

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
company that was uh to for those of you

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
who want a little trivia back then

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
we're running a software catalog

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
magazine that you could buy in software

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,960
in on store shelves and it had a disk on

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,240
it as cd and the cd was loaded with with

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,080
open source and that was

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
you know red hat's early distribution

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
model was through a catalog and then

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
they kind of seized onto linux and

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
and and started working on enterprise

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
linux and you know really uh really

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
started disrupting a lot of these big

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,919
uh servers operating systems enterprise

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,479
class server operating systems and it

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,599
grew

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,319
it grew pretty quickly um you know you

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,400
uh

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
you you see ibm investing a billion

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
dollars in linux

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,400
obviously uh big more recent news uh

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,319
with ibm and it's it's uh

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,880
strategies towards linux happening uh in

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
the ibm acquisition but but ibm's

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
investment in linux

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
is it goes way back you know i think

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,319
that ibm is working hard

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
uh like a lot of larger software

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
companies to prove their credibility

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
around free software and open source but

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
it's almost unfair that they have to

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
because they really have been big

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,479
investors

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
in linux uh for quite a quite a long

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
time

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
by the way uh you have the open source

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,840
initiative starting

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
uh around uh you know i think it was

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,759
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
98 somebody's probably gonna correct me

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
on that um

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
but uh i want to point out that this is

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
actually a different movement

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,759
than the uh gnu project and the free

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
software movement that we saw really

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,080
starting out in the late

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,240
70s with the emacs editor um

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,160
so you know just bear in mind that you

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
know the free software movement

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,599
uh did start earlier than what we

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,400
consider the the open source initiative

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
now

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,520
but of course open source uh you know

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,520
and and uh distribution models of doing

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
collaborating on software in an open way

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
you know would become

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
the runway for making linux what it is

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
today

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
uh you then saw you know uh the debian

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,039
flavor of linux

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
grow into this more desktop friendly

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
version called ubuntu now owned by the

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
canonical corporation they're kind of a

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
big deal you've probably heard of them

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,440
uh

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
git also invented by linus torvald um

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,479
if you didn't know that it's it's it's

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
good to know that uh

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
this guy's really important you know i

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,360
think get in many ways

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
um possibly more important than

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
i don't know whatever i say it's as

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,919
important as linux

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
it is i mean what it's done for free

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,240
software and proliferation of free

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
software

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
and the ability to spin out into

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
something like github it's it's as

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
important

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,080
uh the start of the linux foundation

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
people who actually employ

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
linus torvald and then of course you

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,080
know moving into to now

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,760
you know we see raspberry pi's we see

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
microsoft becoming a huge linux

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
contributor building the

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
linux subsystem for windows into their

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,160
operating system

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,959
they have a huge amount of linux

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
consumption

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,640
on their azure cloud uh interestingly

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,760
um you know i think that they published

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
i don't remember when they published it

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,399
but

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
linux pretty quickly outpaced uh windows

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,080
server has the operating system

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
of choice running on azure and then of

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,360
course we have the ibm acquisition

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,839
uh recently of red hat and then

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,640
this kind of interesting suzy purchasing

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,399
rancher i think kind of taking their own

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
play it uh cloud native infrastructure

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
happening uh pretty recently so

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
really a long and interesting history uh

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
that it did all start uh very

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,120
organically in in the forums of uh

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,720
you know unix enthusiast forums and a

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
hobbyist just kind of putting a free

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
operating system out there

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
okay so um a lot of interesting history

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
there but why

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,519
you know why are you here why are you

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
you know interested in this why

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,800
why is thinking start thinking about

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
developing on linux well there's really

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,880
you know a lot of good reasons to do it

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
first of all very powerful command line

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,040
and tools and i know that

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
you know it's it's a bit of a it's a bit

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
of a bold move for me to start with by

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
plugging the command line as for

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,160
for a lot of folks who may be new to

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,519
linux that may seem a little bit

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,920
unfamiliar or scary um but it is

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,240
a lot of what gives linux its power and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
its ability to very flexibly remotely

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
administer

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,440
linux so you know i'm not saying day one

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,519
you need to start with the command line

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
probably shouldn't these days why put

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,320
yourself through it

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,760
but you will need to embrace it you will

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
need to learn it at some point if you

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
really want

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
mastery over your servers and mastery

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,920
over the uh

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
the machines that you're controlling

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
okay

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,640
um a lot of options for productivity

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,079
improvement uh

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,519
so again you know scripting part of the

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,360
the power of a command line and part of

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
the camar the power of working with

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
something that's just

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,279
text in a terminal and just relying on

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,440
freeform text input and output

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,640
is scriptability right now i realize

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
that we can do

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,120
macro recordings and stuff like that

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,600
with gui environments

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,680
but you know if you've ever you know

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,640
tried to set that up versus just writing

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,399
a small script

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
i think you know most of us can probably

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
agree it's easier to write the script

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,959
and the command line just makes it super

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,839
easy to do that

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,760
free is in free speech okay so we can

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
modify it customize it

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
we can learn from the source code it's

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
truly community driven

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
and this is true for all linux okay as

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
we'll look at the the actual anatomy and

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
architecture of

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
a flavor of linux in a moment um you

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
know you'll

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,360
you'll you'll see that that linux is in

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
fact unified i mean you do see a lot of

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
different flavors

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,160
but everything centers and anchors

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,399
around a common kernel which is

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
community software it's customizable

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,880
modifiable

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,920
uh very easy to prototype uh things in

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,600
linux because it's

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,800
that flexible um very accurate testing

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
because it's easy to

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
recreate production environments uh in

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,760
linux there's not

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
you know spinning up and spinning down a

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
linux environment um

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,639
especially a non-licensed linux

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,399
environment like centos or something

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,040
like that

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,079
you can there's no cost in doing that

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
and so you can

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
you can start from scratch in your

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
testing environments and of course this

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
is happening faster and faster and more

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
mature ci cd pipelines

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
moving even from vms into containers

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,760
where things spin up immediately now but

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,639
the point is you you can

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,079
really reduce a lot of your friction in

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,079
your delivery pipeline

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,839
uh because of the ease of spinning up

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,760
and spinning down fresh environments

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,040
and recreating the same conditions that

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,920
you would have in your in your

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
development environment uh natural

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
environment for

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,959
uh web technologies like apache or nginx

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
that you may be wanting to use

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,320
as a front-end um you do have good

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
options first for

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
for security hardening such as se linux

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
and and if any of you have heard oh se

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,079
linux is i heard my friend said it's

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,760
awful and i don't want to mess with it

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
that used to be true it's not true

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
anymore right the tooling around se

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
linux has really improved and it's a lot

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,800
easier to work with now

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
uh and and really can be the difference

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,560
between you know whether or not your

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
system gets compromised we've we've

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
absolutely

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
uh done forensic work with customers who

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
have been you know kind of post

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760
post hack and gone in and found out you

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
know if you had just enabled se linux on

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
this machine that attack vector wouldn't

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
have been available or something like

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
that

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,320
it did pave the way for this newish

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
world of containers and microservices

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
and

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,920
and instant release and all the

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
wonderful things that we've been talking

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
about

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,240
uh this year at the show easy automation

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,560
uh

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
through tools like ansible uh we talked

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
a little bit about

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
you know the importance of understanding

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,399
the command line so that we can do

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,959
remote administration through ssh

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,639
um you know just you know if you if

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
you've worked with windows servers in

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
the past

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
and you've had to do you know you know

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
remote desktop clients and stuff like

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
that

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,199
when they work they work but when you're

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040
in low bandwidth and

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,560
situations or when you're you're having

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
problems it's just you know it can be

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079
really painful you can get a lot of lag

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,800
it can be really difficult using that

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,800
type of remote desktop

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,480
remote desktop administration but

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
through ssh on this command line you can

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
be in a low

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,720
a low bandwidth environment and still

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,519
have you know

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
really good certainly faster and less

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
laggy

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
administration that you would have

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,639
through you know through trying to do a

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
shared desktop

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
and you can of course scale to huge

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,639
sizes without use license costs and

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,760
bottom line linux makes you look cool

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,560
that's really why y'all are here okay uh

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,199
it's really good

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
particularly for web development uh it

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,959
was the

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
uh original home of the lamp stack and

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,360
this is an old picture

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,440
um but the lamp stack uh was you know

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
early aughts early 2000s kind of like

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
the de facto

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
uh free software or open source software

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,480
web stack that was out there

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,920
so you would build on a linux machine

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
you would throw apache web server in

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
front of it you'd use a database

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,639
hopefully postgres and not mysql and

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
then you'd throw a php or some other web

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
language

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
on top of it now believe it or not this

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,360
stack has not

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
really changed a ton you know i mean we

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
we

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
have different substrates now you know

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
we're looking at containers and

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
everything like that but

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,600
you know there's still a lot of php out

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,199
there arguably you're starting to see a

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
lot of like node.js and more just

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
javascript driven things but they're

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
still being hosted predominantly on

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
linux

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
servers even if those linux servers are

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
now like stripped down

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
you know core os containers or something

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
like that nginx we're seeing more of

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,079
that in our ingress but it's still just

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,839
a web server so

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
you know end tier has maybe changed a

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
little bit in our newer world of like

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,680
distributed

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,920
container driven microservice sas stuff

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
um but in terms of like the technologies

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
if you just you know

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,560
didn't use a brand on them or didn't use

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,440
a vendor they're kind of the same

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
uh great web app prototyping environment

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
super easy to install

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
across multiple servers really easy

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,000
access to error logs

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,399
tons of other web platforms available to

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,759
you easily on linux um are there

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
downsides to linux sure

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
yeah uh definitely i mean in in the one

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,199
on the one hand i think the reason that

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,920
you haven't seen a lot of

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,680
unification uh onto you know like the

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,040
like the year of the standard linux

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,279
desktop or any of that

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,959
is that there is just a surfeit of apis

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
frameworks run times tools all these

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
different things

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
you have i've heard it called the

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,920
tyranny of choice before

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,800
um but you have a a lot of uh

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,440
ways to create quote linux apps right

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
and and

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,120
there have been some attempts at fixing

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
some of this fragmentation but they

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
haven't really worked out too well to be

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
honest uh things like snaps weren't very

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,800
well

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,240
uh accepted by communities and stuff so

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,920
what you end up with is what you end up

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
with in a lot of open source which is

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,800
fragmentation right

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,920
now uh you know fragmentation has a lot

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,720
of benefits

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,399
as well right i mean open source tends

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,040
to be pretty purpose driven

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,079
and you know in in some cases this this

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,440
this

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
the way this market looks isn't really

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
all that different you're taking several

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,639
pieces and you're

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
putting them together to make your

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,720
solution um you know if you look at the

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
android app store versus the apple app

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
store well i mean android is

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
open source and and there are tons of

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
different

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,880
you know distributions of android that

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,319
go on lots of different bits of hardware

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,480
and so sometimes apps don't

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,079
play nicely and that's that is the truth

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,439
of fragmentation that's that's part of

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
having all this choice and it is a

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,600
phenomena

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,079
that you see more and more around open

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,520
source um you see organizations like

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,120
linux foundation

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
like cloud native compute foundation i

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,400
think trying to provide some governance

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
and uniformity to this but

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,280
i think there's always going to be some

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
some necessary fragmentation in the

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
space but

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
for a lot of people that can be

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,000
overwhelming right uh still an orphan

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
desktop

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
still waiting on the uh year of the

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
linux desktop oh i need to update this

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
slide for

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,080
for 2020 but um because of that uh

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
still a tiny market share in terms of

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,280
desktop mixed ux difficult installation

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280
on some notebooks but

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,000
i mean to be honest you know running a

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,120
linux desktop is a wonderful thing it is

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
um but in terms of your work

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,919
right i mean mostly people are are

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
interacting with remote linux servers

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
or they're working with linux based

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,280
docker containers uh

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,880
a lot of times if you're really good

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,160
with your automation and you're mature

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,440
with your devops you're not even really

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
interacting directly with the box

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,240
anymore you're just using automation

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
uh tools to hit it so you know the the

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,039
the desktop

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
although a lot of strides have been

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,640
taken and there are some wonderful

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,000
desktop desktop distributions

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
um of linux like pop and linux mint and

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,960
stuff like that

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,520
still a small market share in comparison

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,440
with um with other desktop

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
other desktop platforms what are we

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
doing on time here okay good

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
so how do you get started well the first

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,679
thing you have to do is pick your flavor

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,760
of linux now what's a flavor well

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,120
linux itself a distribution of linux

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
always starts with what we call the

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,320
linux

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,919
kernel okay so that's kernel.org you can

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,480
go look at it that is the

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,559
you know the maintained source code of

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
linux for which linus torvald is still a

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,840
moderator

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
of that code right when you are

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
committing to linux when you're a kernel

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
developer

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,080
which is pretty rare that's that's the

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
work that you're doing

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,080
you're committing to the linux kernel

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,799
all distributions of linux start with

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
the kernel

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,240
which is just the basic bit of the

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,679
operating system that allows you to

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,720
interact with enough of the

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,080
machine hardware and enough of the um

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
the built-in operating system and all

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
the parts of the computer that you need

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,520
to be able to interact with

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,320
to start installing other pieces of

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,400
software

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,640
to support the operating system to be

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,400
able to do more with it right so

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,120
linux right doesn't have like a desktop

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,919
because linux is the linux kernel right

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,200
but you have

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
several desktop projects built on top of

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,120
linux that give you

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,400
a unified ui environment and then

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,679
different flavors of linux so ubuntu

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,919
red hat arch linux susie

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,720
they're going to choose or curate

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
various

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,400
various bits of supporting software that

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,400
that community has decided

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
they want to put in their distribution

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,039
of linux and it tends to all be free

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
software

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,320
tends to all be software that you pull

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,880
from public package repositories tends

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,039
to be

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
really easy to install and consume all

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,679
of this other free software that

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
supports

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,919
using the the linux kernel and it is

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
just that supporting software that

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,880
really differentiates

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,960
one flavor of linux from another so what

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,080
what user experience did the community

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
have in mind

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,760
you know is this bill is this this

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
distribution of linux meant for

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,679
beginners for instance or meant for

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
people who just want to use it

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
as an easy desktop environment and may

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,120
not be like deep linux enthusiasts but

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
still want to use linux right and for

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
that you have

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
you know you you have good options you

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,720
have options of linux that are super

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,400
stripped down and meant

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,159
just for like low powered embedded

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
hardware you have some

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,799
you know stuff that's kind of in the

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,559
middle you have flavors of linux that

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,080
are meant to reinvigorate your 10 year

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
old laptop um

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,159
you know i have i have a version of

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
debian running on a 12 year old macbook

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
and it's

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,280
still capable of doing basic stuff like

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
watching netflix or whatever you know i

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,440
mean it

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,200
still works for that um so you know to

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
be a little bit diligent about

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
you know what flavor you think is really

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
going to kind of work for you and the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
good news is

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,480
nowadays it's all pretty flexible you

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
have the ability to any of the

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
mainstream

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,039
versions you can preview uh you know how

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400
the operating system is going to feel

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,159
very easily

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,480
you can download what's called a live

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,240
usb cd where you can actually like

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,919
run it in a vm right on your windows

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,559
machine and play around inside there and

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,400
make sure that

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,720
you like it before you choose to install

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
it you can live boot your machine

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
uh you know so that you're actually your

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
machine is dedicated and running the

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
operating system but you haven't

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
actually installed it you're running it

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,720
all

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
off of a thumb drive so there's there's

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,440
a lot of different ways that you can

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,200
preview we're gonna look at some of that

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
uh but the main differences between

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,559
these different flavors the main

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
the real mainstream flavors are like the

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
package management and what i mean by

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
that is like how do you install software

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,120
onto the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
under the box so with linux you know if

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
you're used to windows

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
or even mac to a degree where you have

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,480
to go and like you know go out to the

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,039
internet and

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,799
and grab software and download it and

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,440
run an installer and install it on your

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
machine

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
and typically that's not what you're

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
doing in linux i mean there are some

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
bits of software that install that way

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
but for the most part you're just

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
running like a single command line

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,919
go grab this piece of software or

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
install it and then it figures out all

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,640
the bits and pieces that it needs and it

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,400
just throws it there and it's just

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
you just have it some of the operating

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,360
systems too some of them like like

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,520
ubuntu have taken it a step further to

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,600
the next logical step and giving you a

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,039
graphical more like app store type of

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,039
interface to the software but for the

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,440
most part um

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,200
uh package management is how you're

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
going to be installing software

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
um and that's what's going to define

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,960
kind of the ecosystem that you're

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,760
that you're living in um and so pay

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,760
attention to that

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
what what seems easiest to you in terms

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
of installing software

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,280
um and then of course the kernel version

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,799
i go for go for the newest possible more

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
security and better performance that

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
kind of thing

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,440
pay attention to the community look for

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,880
quick releases uh look for people who

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
have a fast response to security

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
vulnerabilities most of the mainstream

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,000
ones do you know if you start with

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
something like an ubuntu or a centos or

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
red hat or something you're going to get

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,600
all these things

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,919
there are very focused distributions as

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,520
well such as for instance the kali linux

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,880
distribution which is really good for

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,559
security professionals it comes with a

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,240
lot of curated software that's good for

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,600
doing penetration testing and scanning

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
and all that good stuff

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,559
uh but there's pretty much something for

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,360
everybody there's just a bunch of

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,960
different

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
a bunch of different logos bunch of

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,720
different flavors some of them may look

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,159
familiar to you

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,600
um interoperability with with other

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
operating systems is really important

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,440
when you're getting started here

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,640
um so you do have the ability to cross

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,200
compile uh

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
and and some of these uh you have cross

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
plat work

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,280
excuse me cross-platform frameworks like

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
java and things like that which pretty

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,200
much look the same

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,320
in both environments uh probably the

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
easiest way

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
to get started if you're on a mac or

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
you're on windows now is going to be

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,760
through one of these virtual machine

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
solutions like vagrant uh virtual box

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,720
i'll show you an even easier one in a

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,360
second but these are going to

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,120
effectively allow you to just uh

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,720
run a linux implementation full

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
installation running right on your

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,760
existing

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,799
laptop inside your your current

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,840
operating system

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,440
just to you know um just as a way to

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,960
to start it to get it without having to

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,320
really commit too much to it i mean

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,320
there are people who do plenty of like

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
full-time work and just linux vms on

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
their

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
you know on their macs or on their their

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
their windows machines which which

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,480
is absolutely fine um but it's a pretty

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,679
easy way to get started with it

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,760
in terms of like uh you know moving

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
software from one platform to another

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,799
uh there are some solutions that will

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
allow you to like run

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,000
windows applications on linux there's

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
the wine

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
which stands for wine is not an emulator

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
because it's actually like a

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,960
re-implementation

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,559
of the underlying uh shared libraries

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,919
for linux for excuse me for windows and

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,679
stuff in linux

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,520
um and then you know file system

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,159
interoperability so being able to share

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,200
files

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,200
um between uh between

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,799
linux uh and and other types of systems

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,080
can be achieved through nfs

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,000
uh samba um which is a free

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,559
implementation of

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,559
cifs windows file file sharing system

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
um most of the stuff that you're used to

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,520
is going to kind of look the same

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
your favorite ides and everything in

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
terms of what you might be used to for

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
development have already been ported

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,799
you know up here is eclipse uh running

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,559
inside of linux down here is uh

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,080
uh intellij um i should have put a vs

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,600
code picture but i mean as

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,200
you might imagine vs code has been

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,919
ported beautifully to linux it works

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,960
great

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,720
um and the ux on on these ides is going

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,520
to be pretty much identical

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,279
um you got nice editors like sublime

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,159
text and adam a lot of these were built

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,360
by the way

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,600
on linux first and later ported to

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,000
um platforms like mac mac and windows i

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,679
mean when you start getting into linux

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
you really start seeing how big the

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,320
world of like you know consumer free

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,400
software

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,919
is and there's a bunch and a lot of

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,279
these projects did start as linux

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,039
projects that then moved out to

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,360
commercial operating systems

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,080
uh classic command line editors vm emacs

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,320
nano you can edit from the shell

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
um so on your first install generally

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,840
the community is going to provide you

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
some type of installation media

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,880
usually this is this is in the form of a

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
bootable iso

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,080
and so this is kind of flexible right

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,679
with this you could old school burn a cd

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,279
if you if you have a machine that's got

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
a cd drive still

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,360
more commonly you can burn this iso to a

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,320
usb thumb drive

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,159
and boot to that thumb drive or uh when

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,960
you start getting into virtual box or

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,159
vagrant

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,919
or any of these

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
uh utilities that allow you to run a

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,120
virtual machine locally on your

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,880
on your uh on your laptop or whatnot um

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,200
they will all have a place where you can

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,480
fake boot a cd which they'll ask for

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,200
this iso

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,320
so this is just kind of the the media

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
you'll be able to configure

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,480
everything you want your system software

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
network uh choose a theme in some cases

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,919
so for instance you'll see the next one

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
centos 7 allows you to kind of choose

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
like

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
what type of environment do you want

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,559
this linux to be

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
from there once it's installed you can

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
use the whatever package manager that i

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,400
mentioned

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,760
came with the the operating system to

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
install additional software you can

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,679
download stuff you can build stuff from

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
source

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,520
obviously much easier to do on linux and

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,440
other than other platforms

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,559
so this is uh like just an example this

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,640
is centos 7's

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,799
you know graphical installer okay so

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
this is not hard right i mean you you're

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,600
most of this you know

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,159
it's it's a pretty friendly installer

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
centos aims to be enterprise class linux

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,039
and that means it shouldn't be super

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,279
hard or weird to use

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,480
but i want to kind of point out like uh

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
you know we have this

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,760
this interesting you know pointing out

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,919
how

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,840
how how flexible our operating system

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,159
can really be because

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,480
of the way that it's just the kernel

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,720
surrounded by a suite of software

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
look at how this pre-curated software

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
can determine

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,960
you know even what type of machine

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,799
you're going to end up with you want

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,919
just like a small infrastructure server

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
for just doing like network

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,799
infrastructure stuff

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
you want the most minimal base install

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,159
you could possibly have

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,840
do you want just a basic web server for

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,559
like a basic web app do you want a

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,919
desktop

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,360
environment this is the desktop

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
environment and this is actually letting

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,120
you choose between two separate uh

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,320
windowing or desktop-like environments

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,320
so gnome which is

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,000
uh kind of a popular one that which

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,159
you'll see a picture of in a minute

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,799
kde is another one uh do i want a

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,799
creative workstation with with graphics

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,960
uh applications and all that kind of

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,480
stuff and then do i want any add-ons so

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
this is really cool right i mean this is

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
where you're getting to kind of pick and

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,039
choose what you want your final

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,799
uh operating system to look and feel

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
like and it can be very different based

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
on

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,799
you know the software that's curated for

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
you very minimal install it's super

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,600
stripped down there's no windowing

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,960
environment at all

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
and then something like this is pretty

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
pretty big and beefy and feels more like

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,600
a powerful

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,120
you know desktop environment and you

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,799
have that choice

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,720
and and all of this by the way all of

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,000
these packages that get pulled in are

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
all free software they're all open

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,279
source i mean

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
the the the you you don't have you don't

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,640
have this power and flexibility without

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,240
free software which is

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,159
another great reason to get into linux

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,760
is you're just you're flexing the power

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,520
of free software in a way that

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,000
you just use don't in other operating

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
systems uh this is a picture of gnome

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,080
uh so one of the desktop environments

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,760
it's expired inspired by mac os

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,360
uh so it looks a little bit like mac os

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,760
there's even a dock uh

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
application available this is kde which

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
is meant to look a little bit more like

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,760
windows

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,799
so kind of a familiar explorer type of

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,559
environment here

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,399
and you can just you know freely install

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,679
either of these uh and and

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,159
use whichever one you're comfortable

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,760
with but you do at some point

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,600
want to embrace the shell and we're not

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,840
going to go through all these commands

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,520
um but uh they're here for you in the

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,960
slides which i have to upload still i

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,200
think but i'll make sure that happens

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,559
um you know but this is obviously not an

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,039
exhausted list

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
um but some of these commands like doing

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,960
a directory listing

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,000
changing to a different directory um you

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
know

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,679
dos was inspired by um by

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
unix and if you've done any work in dos

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,240
um

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,760
or even powershell now you know some of

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
this shouldn't feel all too different

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
from you just a different set of

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
commands to do a lot of the same stuff

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
and

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
way more commands and full software

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,360
packages that live

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,120
only in the shell things like wget which

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,880
allow you to go pull websites and

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
website text directly into your command

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
line so

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,039
the command line is super powerful and

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,640
because it's all text driven you can

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,240
script it very easily so

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
do embrace it eventually but not

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,679
necessarily today

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,440
okay um a little overview of the file

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,159
system here you know our configuration

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,159
files live and slash etc

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,679
we have a user directory where we have

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,279
all of our shareable

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,039
and stuff that we want to maybe share

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,799
between users linux

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,399
and unix is meant to be a multi-user

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,039
operating system so

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,520
it is very it has a natural fit uh for

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,399
that

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,200
um home directories per user live in the

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,440
slash home

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,000
and everything in unix and linux is a

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,559
file like everything you don't have you

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,679
know dynamically linked libraries and

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,240
a registry and kind of this concept of

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,720
like

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,640
you know the way that that resources in

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
your on your machine are accessed happen

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,519
through all these different

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,799
vectors or avenues it's really all

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
through a file

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,960
but those files can do a lot of things

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,919
right those files can be network sockets

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,919
those files can be handles to processes

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,080
things like that

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,360
so what can you do today well you can go

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,760
out and play you can

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,960
try installing on bare metal um if you

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,320
have enterprise hardware

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,760
you know most of the time this stuff is

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,039
already developed with linux in mind

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,559
it's going to install just fine

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,720
consumer hardware can be a little bit

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,039
inconsistent um

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
most of the mainstream operating system

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
or most of the mainstream

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
flavors like mint and ubuntu and things

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,480
like that

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,159
uh have gotten pretty good about

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,159
consumer hardware but your mileage may

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,960
vary depending on how obscure the laptop

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,240
is or the desktop for that matter uh

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
usually if you build

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,399
uh if you have like an old pc that

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,000
you've built and it's on a pretty common

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,519
motherboard like common commodity

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,159
motherboard you're gonna be fine

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,519
um grub is a boot loader that allows you

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,320
to dual boot you may have heard that

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,320
term before

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,080
uh so that you can you know and when you

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,519
turn your computer on you can decide

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
okay i want to go into linux or i want

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,080
to go into windows

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
if you're on mac and you're used to boot

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,559
camp it's kind of the same thing

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,480
refined is a utility for mac that lets

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,840
you do a boot linux and mac on the same

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,399
machine as well if you want to if you

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,159
want to run linux natively on your mac

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,440
uh of course vms we kind of talked about

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,480
that being the easiest way to get

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,519
started uh this

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,440
is a vmware fusion running linux mint

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,960
on a mac alright so this is what it

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,000
looks and feels like here is the full

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,600
operating system

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,120
it's kind of like you know it's emulated

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,559
so it's kind of locked in the matrix it

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,960
doesn't really know that it's

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,840
living in a simulation right um but it's

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,600
uh it is

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,039
the full linux mint operating system

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,240
running here there are some limitations

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
to running at the vm

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,440
you have to have special hardware

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,360
extensions if you want to run vms inside

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,880
of vms and special hardware extensions

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
if you want to play with like

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,120
kubernetes and stuff like that inside of

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,960
here so just kind of be mindful of that

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
um so there are some reasons why you

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,360
want to run it right on the metal but

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
this is definitely the best

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,880
like the easiest way to get started

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,159
today if you just want to start

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,880
learning about linux and start getting

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,039
going with it how are we doing on time

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
10 more minutes great linux also loves

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,919
containers

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,519
easy to launch containers inside of

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,600
linux easy to

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,279
download containers that are certain

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,159
types of linux and start playing around

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,320
inside of them

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,159
so you can docker run a centos image for

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,240
instance and have a stripped-down docker

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,159
centos image to start playing with

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,279
this new one i love this thing i just

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,480
stumbled across this pretty recently

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,279
this is handy uh this is a universal iso

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
booter so

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,679
i'll show you another one in a second

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
that i've been using in the past

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,559
specifically for linux

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,480
but what i really like about ventoy

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,240
is that whereas the linux live creator

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,440
that i'll show you in a second only lets

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,440
you boot

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,760
um linux isos this actually has

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,000
created its entirely new boot loader and

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,679
it's totally dynamic and you can boot

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,799
any type of boot media from a single usb

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,200
key so you can boot linux isos you can

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,760
boot windows isos mac isos if you need

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,320
to

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,120
all off of the same usb key so super

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
useful

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,320
and an easy way to get started with

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,079
linux you can just

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,280
grab yourself like a nice fast usb 3 key

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,560
and start throwing isos onto it and run

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,560
have been toy format it and start

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,079
throwing isos on it and you just

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,679
toss this into any computer and let it

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
boot to the thumb drive and you can just

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,560
select whichever iso you want to boot so

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
it's super helpful

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,800
and free and open source um this is the

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,839
one i used to use before that though

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,760
um called the lily or linux live

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,879
usb creator which i still really like

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,399
this for for creating

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,079
uh linux thumb drives uh it lets you

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,839
just from a nice super easy pull down

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
menu select the flavor of linux that you

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,919
want to start playing with

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,679
it even lets you launch it in a vm and

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,760
start you know messing around with it

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,720
it'll save everything that you've done

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,480
in that vm

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,839
on the thumb drive and if you want to

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,599
boot live

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,200
it'll also let you boot live so you can

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,159
you know stick thumb drive in the

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,919
computer

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,839
and uh boot to it and have the full

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,520
native linux linux experience and keep

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,800
everything persistent on the thumb drive

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,720
and then if you want to just later you

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,960
know be in windows or be in mac

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,320
and just launch it in a vm it's the same

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,720
thing you launch into vm so very helpful

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
uh raspberry pi another great way to get

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,440
started with

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,760
linux today uh it's a full system in a

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,040
35 box these things are getting powerful

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,359
i have the 4b

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,480
uh running a a wallboard actually in my

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,920
office and

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,160
these things are are really getting

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
powerful with with an eight gigabyte now

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,599
option for them although more expensive

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,079
than the 35 box

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,440
obviously but a bunch of uh linux builds

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,079
that are available for

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
uh raspberry pi and a great way to just

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,880
get started

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
uh with with linux and a fully dedicated

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,800
machine for a cheap price tag

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,160
you just plug it into any hdmi source

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
and throw an old keyboard and mouse in

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,960
there and you got yourself a full uh

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,640
linux machine environment all right and

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
that's really it uh easiest ways to get

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,119
started uh

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,599
of course you can reach out to me i do

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,119
like people i'm happy to uh to talk to

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
you if you have any questions or you're

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,320
running any issues kind of getting

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,920
started with the stuff hit me up on

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,640
linkedin there's qr code down there if

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,359
you want uh

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,839
to scan that i do blog about a bunch of

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,359
stuff

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,040
as part of my job so feel free to hit

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,320
that up sometimes there are linux blogs

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
sometimes there are other bits of open

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,920
source

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,280
uh most recently did a piece on actually

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,400
ai and ml

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,640
uh deep networks improving software

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,839
fuzzing right so it varies a little bit

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,680
feel free to send me an email all right

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,000
so i think we got a few minutes here for

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,760
questions

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,640
let me go on the q a it looks like we've

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,119
got for these

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,079
can you explain gnu's role in linux and

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,440
why

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,680
we should say gnu linux yeah sure so

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:45,839
um uh

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,839
the free software foundation um

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,839
has a different view of uh open source

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,440
versus free software okay

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,599
uh in the view of the free software

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,720
foundation uh

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,800
software is only free if it can be uh

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,240
if it can be enforced that it'll never

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,560
be put behind

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,839
uh digital rights management or that if

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,440
it's ever modified

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
uh and improved from its original that

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,720
that those modifications

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,480
must be shared back to the community or

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,599
you are in violation of the obligations

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,800
of that license

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,440
okay um the goal of the free software

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
foundation

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,560
is different than the goal of the open

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,240
source initiative neither one of them is

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,520
bad or good right just just different

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,599
set of philosophies

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,359
you know free software is really about

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,000
everyone having access to the source at

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,839
all times and creating communities that

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,520
put that are that are obligated to push

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,440
free software back

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,280
and they really are into the free is in

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,119
freedom aspect of that software don't

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,280
put that software behind drm

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,040
don't put it in a permissive license

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,480
where that software can live in a

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,920
non-free way

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,320
so licensed linux that has now the linux

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,920
kernel is governed by gpl

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,280
but there's a lot of supporting software

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,800
right what did we talk about we said

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,720
that linux is the linux kernel and then

00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,079
a suite of supporting software

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,599
and there are um uh there are certainly

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,359
organizations that have branded

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,680
uh linux and branded the suite of

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,240
software that lives around it

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,760
and the free software foundation

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,560
basically has said well that's not free

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,920
software

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,240
it isn't right there's a there's a

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,040
non-gpl license governing it

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
uh so they want the free software

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,560
foundation would prefer

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
for you to say gnu linux which means the

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,200
truly free

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,560
gpl version of linux running nothing but

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,560
truly free gpl software none of which is

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,560
permissive none of which

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
could be considered non-free okay so

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,680
that's that's that's where they're

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,359
they're they're uh really sticklers for

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,560
that and and frankly i agree with the

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,079
free software foundation that that

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,240
distinction is very important

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,680
you know the goal of free software is a

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,680
free software foundation is to kind of

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,359
change the world through free software

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,880
the goal of open source and the open

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,920
source initiative is to create

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,400
amazing software using a group

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,680
and collaborative model you see so

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,000
they're both very good

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,320
right and most open source software is

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,560
also excuse me most free software

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,079
like free free free software foundation

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,280
foundation free software would be

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,960
considered open source

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
but not necessarily the other way around

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,920
by the free software foundation so

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,480
if you want to learn more about that

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,599
though um there is an excellent

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,480
free software foundation publication uh

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,760
fsf.org called why open source misses

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,960
the point of free software and i know

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,760
that sounds a little

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,040
negative um and and you know the fsf

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,240
kind of beats up a little bit on open

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,160
software a little bit but it will at

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,200
least give you some insight i think

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,079
into um it'll give you some insight into

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
uh

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,119
why they feel that way okay that's a lot

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,400
on that question but it's a big topic

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,599
and it's a good question

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,200
uh recommendations yeah just a heads up

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,800
tyler here uh five minutes i was just

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,280
gonna let you know thank you yeah yeah

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
i'm

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
i'm trying to that was that's a big

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,280
question

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,800
and by the way uh hit me up somewhere

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,760
else later if you want to talk more

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
about that it's a big

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,480
it's a big uh big topic okay uh

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,760
recommendations resources best way for

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,119
beginning to get comfortable with the

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,720
linux shell

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,200
uh great question um i think that

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,160
the linux foundation's linux

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,079
administration

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,680
tutorial set is a really really good set

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,119
to start with there it's not it's not

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,480
free they do charge for the training but

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,960
it's pretty reasonable

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,200
um and uh and they just do an excellent

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,280
job um

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,200
you know i think uh trying

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
one of the first one of the first kind

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
of breakthroughs that people have is

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,319
that like when they're they're using the

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,599
the gui environment and the terminal

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,839
next to each other

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,720
that they are in fact administering the

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,079
same machine

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,680
right it's like it's a it's an

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,280
intellectual leap almost and you have to

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,280
wrap your head around it for a second

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,720
but one thing i like to do is have like

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,319
you know one thing i'll show people and

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
then trainings and stuff

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,599
you know have your traditional file

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,720
window that you'll have in like gnome or

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,880
kde

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,560
uh where you can see your file system

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,240
have that open and then open your

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,680
terminal to that same directory

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,200
and just start messing around just start

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,319
like using the touch command to create

00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
files and everything like that just

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,599
start getting very comfortable with the

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
the relationship between the terminal

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,440
and kind of the rest of the operating

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,760
system

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
but but in you know command references

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,000
are very good too

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
get used to using the man mn command

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,800
which will

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,839
give you a nice handy manual on your in

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,920
your terminal

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,200
um make sure you're using a modern

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
terminal emulator

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,880
because there are some great newer

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,160
terminal emulators like item if you're

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,760
on mac for instance

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,359
that give you all these great shortcuts

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,240
inside the environment that makes makes

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,280
your life easier

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,800
okay reason not to use etcher

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,560
uh no i like etcher that's just fine um

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
i really like that ventoy though because

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,000
it's more universal

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,880
with etcher you can only uh you can only

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,359
boot a single

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,160
iso per usb so you're like burning the

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,560
iso to the usb and that's all you can do

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,359
with ventoy you're literally copying a

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,319
bunch of isos onto the usb thumb drive

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,680
and you can boot any of them okay so i i

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,359
think that's more useful

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,119
but no you can you can use you can use

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,200
that for no reason not to

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,560
uh best use case for something like

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
vagrant well

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,079
that's changing it used to be that it

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,680
was great for just doing local

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,599
development at your workstation and it

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,880
was really easy to just spin up a linux

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,960
workstation and you could even throw

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,200
some ansible at it and you know get

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,200
you know get it set up and but the most

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,240
recent version of vagrant now has a

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,920
cloud deployment

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,280
uh functionality which is really cool

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,960
you should go check it out it's

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,119
it's a cloud native deployment that says

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,359
okay not only do i want you to vagrant

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,200
up

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,839
my image but i want you to vagrant up

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,680
this image on ec2

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,040
so super cool okay um so uh

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,400
so i used to say it was really more just

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,520
like you know doing dead stuff but it

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,920
looks like they're trying

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,359
uh to get moved more into the real cloud

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,040
deployment chain which would make sense

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,599
for the rest of the hashicorp

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,480
uh tech that they've got so i'm still

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,839
probably mostly

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
best for desktop stuff but i mean you

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,960
can deploy right into the cloud now so

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,440
go check that out

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,720
um been told it's a lot harder to dual

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
boot windows on a machine that already

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,720
has

00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,440
linux is that true um

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,599
it can be it depends on the way that the

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,280
uefi bootloader is uh

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,520
is configured on that machine and that

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,079
machine's built-in operating system

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,000
if it's if it's a newer one there's

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,079
probably more flexible options for you

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,440
in there that'll make it easier for you

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,160
but uh but the problem is that that

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,920
windows has a tendency to overwrite

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,520
linux's bootloader

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
so what you end up having to do is like

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,119
install windows and then run a linux

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,280
recovery

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,560
to reinstall the bootloader and tell the

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,079
bootloader to control

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,240
windows all right windows as bootloader

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,920
will not boot a linux operating system

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,480
but the linux bootloader will boot

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,640
windows

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,839
all right so that's why that's out there

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,520
again if you have trouble feel free to

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,200
hit me up and i think i did it and we

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,280
only have 10 seconds left

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,720
and uh make room for the next speaker so

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,440
thanks again for attending i hope you

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,520
enjoyed it and

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,599
enjoy the rest of the show

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,599
