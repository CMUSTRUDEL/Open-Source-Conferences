Abstract: Red Hat has been running a global OpenVPN infrastructure for their associates for years, which have been put under the microscope during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has been put under a lot of stress. Everything ran smoothly, without outages, without snags, with an average of 60% of company associates connected simultaneously during peak times. During this talk, we will demonstrate how the infrastructure has been configured, and all of the Open Source (and proprietary) technologies that were involved.
