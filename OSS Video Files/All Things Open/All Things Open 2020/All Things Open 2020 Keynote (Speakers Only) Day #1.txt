Talk #1 - Erica Brescia - COO, GitHub

The Next 50 Million Developers
We all rely on the ever-growing body of open source software that serves as the building blocks powering much of the modern world. In order to support this continued growth — both to maintain the software we already have and create the software of the future — the Open Source community will double in size in the next five years. Erica Brescia, chief operating officer at GitHub, will share insight into the incredible growth and global expansion occurring in Open Source, and the evolution that is necessary to attract the talent and potential of the next 50 million developers.

Talk #2 - Shedrack Akintayo - Cloud Foundry Foundation
Open Source in Africa 
According to Github reports earlier this year, A certain number of African countries have been listed amount top contributors to open source and also users of Github. Countries like, Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana were all listed. In this talk, I’ll talk about how open source is shaping the future of software development in Africa, very important communities supporting open source in Africa, and key players supporting open source in Africa. I’ll also suggest better ways companies in more developed countries around the globe can support Open Source development and Software in Africa.

Talk #5 - Matt Asay, Amazon Web Services
The Future of Open Source Looks like Cloud
It’s 2020 and some open-source companies keep fighting one of the best things to have happened to open source: cloud computing. This is a mistake, but it’s not one we need to keep repeating. In this talk, I’ll dig into what’s happening in open source licensing and strategies and how the cloud will shape (and improve) our open-source future.

hello

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,920
thanks for having me and thanks to

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
everyone joining today

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,759
while i miss seeing friends in person

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
the shift of virtual events has had a

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,720
huge impact on making conferences like

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
ato

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
more accessible to folks all over the

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
world

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,359
and that's actually pretty relevant

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
about what i'm here to talk to you about

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
today

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,519
so let's dive in

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
the amount of software that we the human

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,480
race will rely on in the coming decades

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,360
will grow

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
exponentially our cars will continue to

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,239
get smarter

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239
software will continue to help us

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,360
diagnose treat and even prevent

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,120
illnesses

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,559
it will help us improve the health of

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,200
our planet as we develop

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,680
solutions to combat climate change food

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,680
shortages and resource constraints

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
and behind all of that is the open

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,520
source community

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
a community that of course many of you

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
watching today

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,359
are a critical part of in order to

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
support this growth

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,280
to maintain the software that we already

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
have and create the software of the

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,240
future

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
we need the open source community to

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,240
grow too

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
we need more developers more maintainers

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
and more contributors

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
to meet the ever increasing demands for

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
software

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
it's basically more more of it all i

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
guess

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,119
and what's amazing is how quickly we're

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,680
already seeing this happen

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,759
so how do we the existing open source

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,079
communities support this growth

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,240
how do we pave a path for new developers

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,320
and ensure the innovation and quality of

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,680
this community continues to grow along

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,439
with its size

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,119
how do we give some of the tireless

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,320
maintainers out there a

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,479
much deserved break to support the

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
continued growth and health of open

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
source

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,600
we need to create an open source culture

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
where anyone can be a contributor

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,159
and grow to be a maintainer we need to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
continue to unleash the network effects

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
of every commit

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,320
and perhaps most significantly we need

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
to enable local and global commercial

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,719
opportunity through

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,280
open source first

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,000
let's talk about contributors and the

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
importance of

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
open source development as a viable

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,640
career path

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
today there are over 50 million

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,440
developers on github

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
in five years we expect that number to

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,640
double

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
that's a hundred million developers who

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
are going to be critical to the

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
acceleration of human progress

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
in the coming decades they're going to

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
come from all over the world

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
but especially from developing nations

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,720
where learning to code and contributing

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
to open source is a path to economic

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,879
growth

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,360
and prosperity this is a map of where in

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,360
the world

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,560
contributions on github are happening

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
today

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,040
five years ago the majority of open

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
source contributions were being made in

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,360
the western world

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,080
over time we start to see more and more

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
regions growing in terms of contributors

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
and now you can see that the epicenter

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
of open source contribution is actually

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,280
moving away from the western world

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,680
as we move into the future we see places

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
like

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,319
india china africa and latin america

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
really start to light up

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
just check out the map there is an

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
acceleration happening in open source

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,360
contributions from outside the western

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,840
world and this is going to intensify

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
over the next five to ten years

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
i'm gonna share a stat that still

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
boggles my mind my son is seven

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,280
and in his lifetime eighty percent of

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
the world population will reside in asia

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
and africa

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
the developing world is really going to

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
drive a lot of the innovation and

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
progress we're going to see in the next

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
few decades and the world is going to be

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,799
richer

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
more dynamic and more inclusive because

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
of this interconnected

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
open source community that we're all

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,040
continuing to build together

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
let's zoom into the impact that open

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,599
source can have on someone's life

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,760
this is sonia john a blockchain

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
developer writer and speaker in kenya

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,159
who

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
recently participated in the github read

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
me project

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,640
she was 25 when hyperinflation hit south

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,319
sudan and she lost her job and 90

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,159
percent of her savings

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,000
she felt like she'd lost everything and

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,400
was starting to get desperate

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
in her own words she moved to kenya

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,840
bought a cheap laptop and installed

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
ubuntu because that's what she had heard

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
programmers do

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,600
and taught herself how to code she

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
didn't have a degree in computer science

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
or an internship with a software company

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
she had a laptop and she had

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
determination

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
the first time someone offered to pay

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
her for a project she just didn't

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
believe it

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
but she built a messenger bot earned her

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,360
first paycheck as a developer and

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,199
discovered the enormous opportunity that

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
had opened up to her

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,120
sonia's story is so inspiring there are

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
brilliant gifted people

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,800
all over the world right now who haven't

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
unlocked their potential to contribute

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,479
to open source

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
as we look ahead to the dramatic rise in

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,919
software development that is coming in

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
the next five years and beyond

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
we need to seek out these folks and

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
create a path to open source

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,080
contribution

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,240
and in turn financial opportunity

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
we need to make it possible for talented

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
developers to have a thriving

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
successful career in open source to get

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
paid for their work

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
to grow their careers and contribute

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
their talent to a space where it has the

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
potential to have

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
enormous impact i'll share some thoughts

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
on some specific ways that you can help

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
with this a bit later we've seen what

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
kind of opportunity open source can

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
bring to one person

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,560
let's now flip that and look at this

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,479
from the other perspective

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
let's look at the network effect of a

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,560
single commit to an open

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
source project for this example we

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,120
picked a commit to tensorflow

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
in june of 2020. this is a real

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
contribution

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,360
contributed by a single developer that

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
commit helps improve tensorflow which we

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
know is being used widely around the

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
globe

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
in the four months that have passed

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,680
since it was made more than 4 500

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,759
developers from over a hundred countries

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
have worked directly on the tensorflow

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
project

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
but this is only the tip of the iceberg

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
let's now look at all the projects that

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,919
have leveraged

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
and directly depend on this version of

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,680
tensorflow

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,280
that single commit is now included in

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,280
about 23

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,800
500 projects on github anchored in 137

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,880
countries around the world

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,479
and so far it has been included in the

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,520
work of more than 50 000 developers from

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,120
151 countries

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,840
the reach of a single commit is

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
incredible this is a compounding effect

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
of a single contribution

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,199
think about the exponential impact a

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
single developer can have in their

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
career

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
multiply that by a hundred million and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,919
just imagine

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,759
what this community can do it honestly

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,120
gives me goosebumps to think about the

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
magnitude of what can be achieved

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
i love this example of just what commit

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,120
can lead to

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
this is evan yu another maintainer who

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
participated in the github readme

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,919
project

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
he started an open source project called

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,759
vue with the intention of building a

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
simple javascript library that he could

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,400
reference to improve his own efficiency

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
he never intended to be a full-time open

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,759
source maintainer but

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
you can get where this is going that's

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
exactly what he does today

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
when he open sourced the project people

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
started using it

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
the community adapted his idea built on

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
it and ultimately helped it evolved into

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
a thriving global community of

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
maintainers

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,360
contributors and users one thing i love

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
about vue is that evan's vision for the

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
project is to give

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
any user a low barrier of entry a good

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
foundation

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,000
and room to grow he said that the ideal

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
user is someone who just got into web

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
development

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
and they are intentionally designing a

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
way for folks to start building without

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
having an understanding

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
of how front-end development actually

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
works

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,759
it's this mindset that can give have a

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,240
huge impact on lowering the barrier of

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,160
entry for new developers to open source

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
if you begin with the foundation of a

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,759
single contributor

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
and has evolved to become an integral

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
part of developer workflows

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
and best of all it's now fully funded by

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,960
the community

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,720
it serves i told you about sony and john

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
earlier and she said something that i

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
think is so insightful

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,120
she said when i'm building solutions and

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,039
decide to keep them closed i recognize

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
that this removes an opportunity for

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
somebody else

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
so most of my work is open source the

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
potential the community is

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
absolutely massive and every project

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
every commit

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
is a building block that the next 50

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
million developers will be able to learn

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,760
from and build on

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,519
so we all need to focus on getting more

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
people to that first commit

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
because of course that's where it all

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
starts

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
so we've talked about the impact that

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
open source can have on sony in other

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,519
people's lives

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,440
and we've talked about the value of a

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,839
commit so

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
let's talk a little bit about money the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,959
growth of open source community has

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
real economic impact according to the

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,360
corn ferry institute

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,279
demand for skilled workers will outstrip

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
supply in the next 10 years

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,720
resulting in a global talent shortage of

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,959
more than 85.2 million people

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
if left unchecked the financial impact

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
of this talent shortage could reach more

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
than 8.4

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
trillion in unrealized annual revenue by

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
2030.

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
this is equivalent to the combined gdps

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
of germany and japan

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
obviously these numbers are for a

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
broader group than just developers this

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
is all skilled workers

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
but an increasing number of these jobs

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
will require technical fluency if not

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
straight coding skills

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,800
open source will play a key role in

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,560
closing this gap and in doing so has the

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
power to help accelerate emerging

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,440
economies

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
let's take a look at one incredibly

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
inspiring program

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,519
related to this laboratory is a social

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
entrepreneurship program in latin

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
america that trains women who have been

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
unable to start careers in web

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
development or ux

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
design the organization then connects

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,000
these women with companies and helps

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,399
them launch a career in tech

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,399
since its inception laboratoria has

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,680
trained over 1600 women

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,000
and 78 of them have started technology

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
careers in 17 industries

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
that kind of success can have a huge

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,480
impact on a local economy

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,040
here's the story of one woman whose life

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,640
was changed thanks to laboratoria

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,399
chireni azkaraga is from puebla mexico

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,320
she had to leave a career in music that

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,160
she loved she started walking and

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
training neighbors dogs to make a living

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,320
in order to support her family

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
she applied and was accepted to the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
laboratoria training program where she

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,560
trained as a ux designer

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,720
she's now a web developer who draws on

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,240
her experience in the arts and in dog

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
training to guide users through a

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
well-orchestrated application experience

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,760
for the program

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
i share this story because there are

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,279
several things that i talked about today

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,360
that form the bigger picture of the

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,600
opportunity ahead

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,519
we need the next 50 million developers

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
to continue to carry the open source

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,560
community forward

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,480
and to create the software will all

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,959
depend on in the future

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,760
there is so much untapped talent all

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,600
over the world

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,440
and so many people are seeking

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,360
opportunities to improve their lives

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
through professional achievement

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,560
financially or often both

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
that talent has the potential to have

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,040
lasting positive impact

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,000
not only on the lives of individuals but

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,480
on innovation

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
and economic growth both locally and

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,600
more broadly

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,240
but together we must continue to remove

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
barriers

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,160
in major league hacking's most recent

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,320
hacker census

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
which is a survey of almost a hundred

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
thousand collegiate hackathon

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
participants

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,240
nearly 62 percent of respondents said

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,360
that they had not contributed to open

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
source yet

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
among them close to 92 percent believe

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
that contributing to open source in the

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
future will be important for their

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
career

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,800
the main thing holding them back is that

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
they feel like they don't know how to

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,600
get started

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,079
or that they aren't skilled enough

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
organizations like laboratoria and the

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
vue project

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
are doing amazing work bringing more

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
people into tech and open source

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,839
and lowering the barriers to getting

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,519
started there are so many ways that we

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
can all get involved

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,760
in paving the way for new developers to

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,720
join the open source community

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
i picked a few great examples but this

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
is far from an

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
exhaustive list google summer of code

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
which i'm sure

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
virtually all of you have heard of by

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,760
now is a program focused on bringing

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
more student developers from around the

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
world to open source

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,240
outreachy organizes three-month paid

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,920
internships with free and open source

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
software projects for people who are

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,680
typically

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,800
underrepresented in those projects open

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,279
collective gives

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
open source projects a transparent way

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
to collect funding and manage their

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,800
finances

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,200
community bridge brings together project

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
maintainers contributors and users to

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
fund open source

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,279
projects improve code security and boost

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,200
the size and diversity of open source

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,200
communities

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,680
of course at github we have github

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,839
sponsors which enables companies and

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,279
individuals to sponsor projects or

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
specific developers

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,880
making open source careers possible for

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
contributors

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
i'd encourage everyone to consider

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,399
sponsoring an individual or a team

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,760
that's doing work that's important to

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,680
you

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
the major league hacking fellowship

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,519
provides educational curriculum

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
and practical experience that new

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,560
developers can put on their resumes

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
right away companies can sponsor fellows

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,600
to work on specific projects within

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
their organization

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
or open source projects in general to

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,959
help

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
more people enter into careers as

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,920
developers

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,279
these projects and platforms are always

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,839
seeking supporters

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
financial sponsors and mentors to fuel

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
their growth

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
so i encourage you to get involved in

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
one or more if you're not already

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,000
whether that's shining a light on the

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
incredible work that they do

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,560
supporting them financially or acting as

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,320
a mentor for folks going through their

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,480
programs

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,639
in addition think about the global

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,720
nature of the developer community

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
build your projects and your communities

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,120
with the needs of developers around the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
world

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,440
in mind do you need to change anything

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
for your software to be useful

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
for folks in emerging economies and

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,399
mobile first markets

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,240
what about places without fast internet

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
what about your community is it

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
welcoming to new developers

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
those from different backgrounds and

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,839
parts of the world and of course

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,600
how do you think about accessibility to

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,079
be available and useful

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
for as many folks as possible i know

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
there's lots of food for thought here

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
and a ton of great talks out there by

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,639
others on

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,560
details around building our projects and

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,519
communities to be more inclusive and

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,040
accessible

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,040
so i encourage you to take a look at

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,959
those

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
what started with a small group of

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,120
academics and researchers back

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
in the 50s and 60s and led to the free

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
software movement in the 80s and the

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,880
launch of the open source movement in

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
the 90s is now a community

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
of 50 million people whose efforts and

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,720
contributions have helped

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,920
define the world as we know it today

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,360
because of you the pace of new software

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,959
is blazingly fast with components for

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,160
almost anything readily available

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,880
because of you there is an abundance of

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,079
exceptionally high quality software

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,680
freely available

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,240
for everyone to use and to build on

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,720
and because of you people around the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
world

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
can learn from the vast array of

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
knowledge and best practices shared

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
openly

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,320
helping pave the way for new

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,279
contributors to open source

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,560
it took decades to grow the community to

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,959
this size

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,839
with your help in just the next few

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
years

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,440
we'll pave the way for the next 50

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
million developers

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
so that open source can continue to be a

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,720
key source of innovation

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,360
global collaboration and an engine of

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079

is growing we have about 59 percent

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,960

um open source i really take it so

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
seriously we can see that nigeria has

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,760
the highest

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,840
um growth in open source nigeria is a

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,799
country in africa my home country

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,000

a little bit of what um

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
github is saying about africa so we have

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,360
about 65 percent growth

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,120

beat nigerians um the entire africa is

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
taking on open source up to the next

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,640
level and we've had

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
collectively about 70 percent more

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
contributors this year

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
than last year which is like really

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,400
insane such stats

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,720
for um open source now let's talk about

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
what is setting um a couple um a

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080

nigeria and nigeria and africa that is

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
helping

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
to spread the gospel of open source um

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,000
oscar so

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,600
open source community africa obviously

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,480
community africa is like a community of

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
creatives

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
driving the open source movement in

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
africa it was basically created to

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,280
encourage more african

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,559
developers to contribute to open source

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
and also um

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
advocate for open source movements in

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
africa the most beautiful thing about

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
oscar is

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,360
it is it is diverse it's um it provides

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,840
um

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,840
a community for both designers for both

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
technical writers for both developers to

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
come together

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,600
and contribute to open source um so

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
oscar demographics um

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
just before move forward i'm also part

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,760
of the um

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,919
organizing team for um for oscar so

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,320
we are currently in about five countries

and program so that uh people that are

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,760
contributing to open source can also get

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
paid

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,880
here in africa while contributing um so

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,559
they're assessing

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
a number of bugs that are available on

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,200
the our own collective

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,440

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,120
effort

by the design team of oscar to help

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,440
designers also get tired in contributing

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,640
to open source so connecting with oscar

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,559

um look-alike teams from the material on

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,559
um play night team

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,799
now the free software and open source

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,000
foundation for africa um

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,559
so it's basically headed by the u.n and

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
um it basically brings people from

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,399
various parts of africa to come up

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,200
and learn more about open source and

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,720
also um learn more about coding

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,279
now how to provide um support for oss in

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,200
africa

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,720
i think uh erica said something

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,159
generally about how to provide support

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,919
to people in on purpose us

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,919
uh but i want to like narrow it down to

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,120
just africa and we need more people to

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,480
sponsor more companies more

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,600
organizations more

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,320
um on foundations to sponsor oss events

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,279
in africa

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,120
currently we've had just um we had just

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,360
open source community africa pushing

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,360
this pushing for this event uh we also

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
need to provide um osa we also need

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,399
these companies and

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,159
organizations and foundations to provide

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,080
oss learning supports for

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,399
um people here in africa we also need to

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,279
we need more oss initiative establishing

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,760
africa because

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,600
a lot of people are still like lacking

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,080
behind when it comes to open source um a

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,399
lot of people

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,240
don't understand what it means so when

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,640
more initiatives are created for

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
people to see how um open source work a

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
lot of people don't understand it

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,200
then we'll see a better increase um in

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,720
open source here in africa we need to um

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
we need more people to provide a voice

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,360
for african oss creators and

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,279
contributors

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,039
they love oss critical economics because

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,520
here in africa are doing great stuff

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,880
um that that they are hardly recognized

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,360
so uh we need people to

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,559
um help us reach out to these oss

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
creators and the contributors here in

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,039
africa

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,720
provide get them or get them on

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,080
interviews to talk about their products

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,960
talk about things they are doing

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,480
um it's it's really served as an in an

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
incentive for more people to get into

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
open source because

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,679
a lot of people feel like they're not

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,799
appreciated enough because i mean

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,279
they're africans but

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,919
um when we provide an enable environment

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,080
for people

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
for oss creators and contributors then

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,799
um would have a better increase

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
in um open source contributions here in

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,520
africa

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,520
so one very important is higher more

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,279
thing is hire more folks from africa i

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,760
mean we have great people here

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,520
that are working that very intelligent

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,440
very brilliant i mean if when companies

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,120
come here to africa to see that

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,399
um we have good people providing open

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,760
source support doing a lot of open

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,159
source on contribution

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,039
um you would see that um this will

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,760
provide um

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,480
a sense of like okay this is i'm great

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,720
so we can

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,240
currently start um providing more

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
support for people here in africa and

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,799
this

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,240
city this will increase the um growth of

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,360
open source here in africa i mean there

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
are a lot of open source companies

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,440
around the world

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,279
so this is this isn't something that

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,520
should be that difficult um

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,320
also one very and very last point is

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,159
promote

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,399
open source from africa github has been

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,760
doing a very um great job promoting open

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,320
source here in africa with the readme

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
project

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,760

to combat

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,000
racial inequalities ibm is a founding

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,920
award

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,400
last year on stage at all things open

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,760
and we awarded this grant quarterly ever

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,880
since

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
now for the winner of this quarter's ibm

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
open source community

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,960

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,119
mission

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
is to increase the number of women of

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,359
color in the digital space

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,320
by empowering girls of color ages 7 to

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,640
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,560
to become innovators in stem fields

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,480
leaders in their communities

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,320
and builders of their own futures

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,240
through exposure to computers and

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,160
technology

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,000
ibm is powering in their mission with

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,000
twenty five thousand dollars in cash

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,599
and twenty five thousand dollars of ibm

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,880
we couldn't be happier to help them in

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,359
their mission

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,960
and if you have an open source focused

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,560
non-profit

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,480
that is that you would like to be under

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,520
consideration for an ibm open source

my name is wendy john and i'm the head

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,359
of global diversity and inclusion at

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,880
fidelity investments

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,560
and my pronouns are she her and hers

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,560
i'm thrilled to be joining you today

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,800
from my home in the state of north

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,520
carolina although i'm sure we all would

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,680
love to be

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,440
in the convention center but this

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,440
opportunity taking it virtual

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,079
allows many others who would not have

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
been able to attend in person to join in

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,520
with us

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,200
before you think i've stumbled into the

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,599
wrong zoom webinar

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,560
i wanted to clarify that yes you heard

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,359
that right

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,280
i'm here from fidelity investments you

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,760
may be wondering what in the world

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,960
a dni leader from a financial services

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
company is doing

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,920
amongst the inspiring open source

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,040
speakers you'll hear from this morning

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,560
and the first reason is this we are not

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,160
just a fin serve company we also like to

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,599
think of ourselves as a technology

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,960
company

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,960
we spend billions annually on technology

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,560
that spend covers everything from

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,040
customer platforms

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,200
to tools that help us collaborate to

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,599
building virtual reality experiences to

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,280
help onboard new employees

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,480
firm wide 25 of our employees work in

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,119
technology

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,079
and in north carolina home to all things

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,440
open

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,640
60 of our employees are technologists

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,640
you heard me right 60 percent of my

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,760
fellow colleagues in north carolina

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,800
are not financial advisors not customer

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,920
service reps

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,520
but people like you who build technology

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,200
we pride ourselves on having an

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,720
innovation culture built around

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,520
continuous development

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,000
and a growth mindset our employees

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,000
participate in our blockchain club

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,920
join our women in technology special

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,960
interest group and get involved with

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,000
fidelity labs

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,920
our incubation lab for new ideas

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,240
we have a long history of investing in

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,560
the cutting edge with recent commitments

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,480
around cryptocurrency and blockchain

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,839
and exciting collaborations like our

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,280
quantum computing efforts with aws

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,400
fidelity is always creating in fact

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,359
we hold 259 patents on a variety of

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,359
topics

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,760
a great testament to our consistent

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,240
focus on innovation

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,320
one area specifically around open

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,320
collaboration is our work to release

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,839
more of our machine learning efforts as

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
open source

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,280
these have been focused on making common

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,520
algorithms available

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,359
and also for creating more simplified

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,320
interfaces for frameworks like

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,200
tensorflow

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,960
and pytorch you'll hear more about our

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,359
open source approach and efforts

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,640
from my colleagues justin ratcliff and

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,720
sachin sulkin

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,720
in their respective sessions at all

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,520
things open

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,400
okay so now we know why fidelity is here

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,880
today

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,640
but what does inclusion and diversity

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,920
have to do with technology

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,560
and more specifically open source

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,400
everyone attending today's event is on

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,440
the hook for co-creating something

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,680
innovative

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,760
you sit on teams and manage projects

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,720
that create tools and platforms

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,000
that improve people's lives maybe even

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,560
in ways they haven't

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,240
asked for yet the connection between

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,560
diversity and inclusion

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
innovation and profitability has been

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,280
proven

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,760
here a few data points to ground us all

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,800
mckinsey's 2019 analysis found that

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,040
companies in the top

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
quartile for gender diversity on

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,440
executive teams

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,640
were 25 more likely to have above

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,880
average profitability and this goes even

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,880
further for ethnic diversity

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,920
where companies in the top quartile of

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,200
ethnic diversity

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,960
outperform others by 36 percent

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,160
and this holds true for times of

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,280
uncertainty like we're in right now

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,920
several reports showed that in 2008's

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
global financial crisis banks with a

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,720
higher share of women on their boards

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,400
were more stable than their peers

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,000
although we all know that diversity and

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
inclusion is important

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,920
technology and other industries like

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,359
financial services

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,440
remains largely white and male

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,040
since june of this year there's been a

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,800
larger spotlight on the importance of

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,880
diversity and inclusion

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,119
there's tremendous energy around these

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,160
topics and how it applies in all that we

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,640
do

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,040
people want to take action but often

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,800
don't know where to start

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,480
it's the same problem that has stalled

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,200
this work for decades

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,359
sometimes it just feels too big to solve

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,280
at fidelity we approach diversity and

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,119
inclusion a little differently

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,920
with a behaviors-based approach that

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,480
taps into the science of habit change

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,480
we have a concept called simple starts

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,400
which prompts our employees to make

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
adjustments to the behaviors and

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,720
business processes

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,480
that make up their day-to-day work by

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,920
focusing on behaviors within your

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,160
immediate control

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,839
rather than trying to shift an entire

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,520
organization's culture

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:19,440
all at once we see incremental changes

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,760
that add up significantly over time

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
our concept may be called simple starts

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
but there's nothing simple

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,040
about the work of diversity and

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,280
inclusion it's a complicated

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,560
ingrained problem that can't be solved

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,319
overnight

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,240
getting started though can be a lot

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,280
simpler with some of the ideas that i'll

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,040
share with you today

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,000
i'm going to cover a few simple starts

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,880
in three distinct categories

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,680
team management and dynamics everyday

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,960
pivots

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,800
and of course technology

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,720
since open source is all about coming

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,920
together on collaborative teams to

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,760
create and build

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,680
let's start with team dynamic team

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,839
management and dynamics

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,800
here are a few simple behavioral changes

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,800
you can implement on your teams today

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,480
rotate work assignments on your team

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
regularly including

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,599
team housework like note taking or

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,400
meeting scheduling

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,240
and higher profile projects versus only

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,440
going to the well-known few

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,920
members of your team set team members up

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,880
with mentors or sponsors with different

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,400
backgrounds

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,400
to expand their view of the world

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,280
encourage participation or development

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,079
of employee resource groups or ergs

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,920
at fidelity we have six ergs and four

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,440
special interest groups

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,119
more than half of our employees

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,119
participate in at least one of these

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,240
groups and some participate in three or

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,480
more

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,520
consider starting affinity groups and if

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,839
your organization does not yet have them

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,920
these groups provide ready access to

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,560
diverse thoughts and perspectives

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,119
they can serve as focus groups talent

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,040
pools

00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:00,079
and or business partners in your work

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,920
audit the membership of your team seek

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,680
participation and contribution from a

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,160
diverse set of people

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,680
and when an underrepresented person

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,400
leaves your team

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,599
dig into understanding the why in case

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,920
there are changes that need to be made

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,359
reconsider your team participation

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,440
criteria

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,520
balance the need for specific skills

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,079
like coding which can be taught

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,720
with the value of fresh perspectives

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,599
which

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,440
might be impossible to teach at fidelity

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,599
we have a few programs focused on

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,720
non-traditional sources of talent

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,480
in technology fidelity made introduces

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,960
associates from traditionally

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,800
non-technical roles in the enterprise to

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,680
apply their business experience to tech

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,920
problems

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,319
and we partner with reach hire to

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,800
provide career paths for a diversity of

00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,520
life

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,119
situations now let's talk about everyday

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,119
pivots

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,400
these are changes that everyone can make

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,200
regardless of their role

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,640
on a team or in an organization to be

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,200
more inclusive

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,079
and they span across work life and home

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,680
life

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,119
it's difficult to influence one without

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,720
the other and what's the difference

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,319
especially these days

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,040
you're here with me in my home language

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,480
matters so pay careful attention to the

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,319
words you use

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
use pronouns in your introductions to

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,839
create safety for others to share how

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,560
they

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:27,520
identify use more inclusive terms

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,599
for example stop using guys as a way to

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,440
refer to mixed groups of people

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,040
and look for something that might be a

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,440
little more gender neutral

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,319
like folks we use that a lot here in the

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,520
south of

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,280
of us capitalize the be in black

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,359
in your writing when referring to black

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,920
people or communities

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,960
for the open source community eliminate

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,560
terminology

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,480
like whitelist blacklist or master slave

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,040
and consider alternatives for other

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,920
gendered language

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
monitor your information diet this means

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
paying

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,480
careful attention that the books you

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,319
read podcasts you listen to

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,839
and the shows you view aren't all

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,640
created by people with the same

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,880
backgrounds or perspectives

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,760
demand a seat at the table and bring

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,960
someone new

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,520
along with you where or when possible

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,000
for the woman in the audience make sure

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,400
you're representing the work you've done

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,599
don't be shy or self-deprecating when

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,400
sharing your accomplishments

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,040
overall exposing ourselves to new

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,240
thoughts

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,960
ideas approaches and people makes us all

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,880
better

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,599
and as a result we create better

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,000
products and solutions

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,520
and last but certainly not least

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,960
technology

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,119
the good news is that due to

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
advancements developed by technologists

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,240
like you

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,440
we the humans don't have to do this all

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,280
on our own

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,800
here are a few ways we can use tech to

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,119
help us create more diverse and

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,040
inclusive workplaces

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,960
use artificial intelligence to audit the

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,280
language and job descriptions

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,520
at fidelity we run our jobs through a

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,599
tool that scans for bias language

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,359
it takes about six minutes per role but

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,079
has greatly improved the number of

00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,040
female

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,640
applicants we receive meet diverse

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,560
people where they are

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,160
implement processes that post all of

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,240
your open jobs

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,359
to a variety of diverse online job

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,000
boards

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,119
remember that data isn't the end-all and

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
be-all

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,160
my friend and leading ai ethicist and ai

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
activist renee cummings reminded us

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,760
in a recent talk at fidelity that

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,200
there's no such thing as

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,400
raw data the data points we use to build

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,440
technology

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,440
often comes with built-in bias because

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,280
it originates from an environment where

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,200
racism is systemic

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,720
and stereotypes have been baked in for

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,119
centuries

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,880
ensure you're evaluating all of the

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
components into your technology

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,880
solutions for bias

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,000
and engage diverse stakeholders

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,760
throughout

00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,520
you'll hear more from another of my

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,000
colleagues melinda

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,480
thalbar on our approach to ai bias and

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,200
mitigation at fidelity

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,119
invest in places to come together online

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,160
of course the open source community has

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,640
been practicing

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,119
true online collaboration for years for

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,000
example at the linux foundation

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,319
covid19 has exemplified the importance

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
of

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,160
creating virtual spaces for people to

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,760
gather and share ideas

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,400
ensure these online spaces are

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,000
accessible and open to all

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,400
using tools like live closed captioning

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,240
as i shared those three categories

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,880
doesn't it sound a lot like people

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,240
processes and technology a framework

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,000
many of you are already familiar with

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,680
i hope that these simple starts i shared

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,720
today can help you and your teams get

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,720
started

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,559
if you've already started perhaps i've

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,000
given you a few new ways to continue the

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,680
journey

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,640
it can be easy to let the problem

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,760
paralyze you that analysis paralysis we

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,599
all know

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,680
our country's diversity and inclusion

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,200
challenges may feel too big to solve

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,640
if you zoom out so focus on zooming in

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,400
and get started zoom in and shift from

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,200
trying to change the world or your

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,200
company

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,680
to changing three to four behaviors on

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,359
the teams where you contribute

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,000
progress against diversity and inclusion

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,640
is a lot like open source in that way

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,280
most of us will not unveil a shiny new

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,359
product or solution to the problem

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,720
this is something we will all build

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,520
together

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,520
right out in the open bringing the best

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,359
of ourselves to contribute

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,240
and the first few attempts might not be

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,880
perfect but with some iteration

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,440
we can create transparent solutions that

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,319
amount to real change

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,599
thank you all for the time and enjoy the

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,920
rest of this year's

00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:52,720
all things open so i'm first of all

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,200
very grateful for todd i have i think it

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,240
might have been 2007 was my first year

00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:02,000
uh presenting at what was then called

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,240
uh poscon and has since become all

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,680
things open todd has been very gracious

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,559
in the past of

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,160
asking for my uh my opinion on things as

00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,599
to what he should do to make this event

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,720
even better and

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
um fortunately he has not heeded any of

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,319
my suggestions which is

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
why all things open is as fantastic as

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,079
it is today and he's just done an

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,559
amazing job

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,800
i want to talk a little bit and

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,040
appreciate todd and the

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,880
other speakers that we've had so far i

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,760
want to talk a little bit about

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079
open source in the cloud which has been

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,680
a

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,920
contentious issue in the in the past

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,520
um but in the spirit of the people who

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,079
have already spoken i don't want to talk

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,599
about it from a contentious angle

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,599
i want to talk about it in the spirit of

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,880
partnership

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,319
but i'm going to start with something

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,119
that might sound a little contentious

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,119
and that is

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,440
in a conversation that i had not too

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,720
long ago with a colleague of mine matt

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,880
wilson

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,400
he made the observation that most

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,680
enterprise software

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,319
is garbage um he might not have used the

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,559
word garbage but he said

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:11,040
we talked about why enterprise software

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,319
is so incredibly bad

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,960
and his suggestion was that the reason

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,200
for that

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,440
ultimately comes down to the fact that

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,160
the vendors of the software are not the

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,880
ultimate users of the software

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,559
and the closer we could get and this

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,400
goes back to something that

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,800
now ibm president then red hat ceo

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,680
jim whitehurst said back in 2009 which

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,480
was

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,920
we have so much waste in in the software

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,720
industry

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,280
we really need end users there's not a

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,359
great

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,480
word for that but let's say end users or

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,240
customers

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,880
also not a great way of expressing it

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,000
but end users of software we need more

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,440
end users of software contributing to

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,119
open source so that instead of

00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,720
reinventing the wheel we can collaborate

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,800
that's what i want to talk about today i

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,079
want to talk about how we get there

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,440
and how we bring down the wall between

00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,200
open source and cloud because there's

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
been this myth that's surfaced over the

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,079
last few years and that is that

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,359
in some way cloud and open source

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,319
are in contention are in conflict

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,960
and i would argue the opposite is true

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,240
uh

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,119
recently in a new stack series

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,480
that that i wrote and i got so much

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,880
great feedback from people

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,079
on twitter and uh and quote unquote in

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,359
real life

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,079
um that said the cloud would not be

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,319
possible

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,520
without open source and i think that's

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,640
true i think it might have been

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,280
erica who started this day off who said

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,040
it really

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,400
i mean part of it comes down to

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,359
economics but it's not

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,720
really a matter of economics it's really

00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,720
a matter of how

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,760
how would you count up all the licenses

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,000
if you're thinking of

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,920
thousands or tens of thousands or

00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
millions of servers

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,599
how do you do that with open source you

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,920
don't really have to think about that

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,440
with traditional enterprise software

00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,800
proprietary software

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,520
he did and it makes it such that

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,760
the cloud would be if not impossible and

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,520
i would argue impossible

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,800
at least extraordinarily difficult and

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,839
chris debona who i think is

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,359
speaking tomorrow made that contention

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,359
years ago that google would not be

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:26,480
possible without open source

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:29,280
so we know that the cloud enables or

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,200
that open source enables the cloud but i

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,319
want to talk a little bit about how

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:38,160
the cloud is enabling open source

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,520
so and and as part of that a good friend

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,599
of mine sam ramji

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,960
who's now chief strategy officer at

00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,119
datastax

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,880
used to be the open source guy back when

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,559
that was a thing at microsoft but that

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,000
was a long time ago

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:55,119
now open source is everybody's thing

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,839
at microsoft um sam

00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,000
likes to say if you want to go fast go

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,680
alone

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,079
but if you want to go far go together

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,359
it's not his saying but he says it a lot

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,520
so i want to talk about that and i'm

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,480
also going to talk about pie in part

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,880
because

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,480
at that first poss-con all things open

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,880
that i spoke at todd

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,200
uh todd fedesol because that todd's like

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,200
that it's at southern hospitality

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,079
um but also because i like to bake pie

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,559
so we're going to talk a little bit

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,559
about pie

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,559
when you think of the biggest

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,800
contributors to open source

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,480
i'd be interested and we can't take a a

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,400
poll here and ask everybody but i'd be

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,240
interested who you think of when you

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,760
when you think of that when i say the

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,680
biggest contributor that you can think

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,680
of to open source

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,440
put it keep it in your mind

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,440
i'm pretty sure you're thinking of a

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,680
cloud vendor right now and if you are

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,880
you if you're playing your odds of the

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,400
top 10

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,760
uh open source contributors

00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,960
seven of those top ten are cloud vendors

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,599
and i use the term cloud um a little bit

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,040
loosely

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,040
i shouldn't say vendors i should say

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,200
cloud companies because in that number

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,200
is facebook for example

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:14,000
in that in that group is amazon

00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,800
in that group is google microsoft red

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,920
hat

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,359
ibm but also other companies

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,760
there are a few other companies that

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,079
don't fit that cloud label like

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,680
intel for example but intel does a fair

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,040
amount to enable the cloud with

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,680
with chips and other saw in software

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,520
but think about that why would that be

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,280
that the vast majority

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,200
if you if you tally up the biggest

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,319
contributors in terms of

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,119
raw contributors to open source why

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,760
would they be cloud companies

00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,799
and i think it's i think it if you if

00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,799
you step back for

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,720
for a second it's a little bit obvious

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,440
why that would be the case

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,160
it's because cloud companies don't

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,319
really

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,520
have anything to lose by contributing

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,680
software

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,520
they don't sell software facebook

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,720
doesn't sell software

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,599
aws or amazon doesn't sell software

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,440
sell services so the software itself can

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,079
be given away and if we look again at

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,920
the

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,520
at the things that have come out of the

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,599
different cloud companies

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,200
amazing software like kubernetes that

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,520
came out of google

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,640
um this is the sort of thing that the

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,079
cloud enables

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,680
because it takes away the competitive uh

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:32,000
need to keep software proprietary

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,000
so if you

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,000
if you run some sort of calculus as to

00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,200
contributes equals to benefits well it

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,520
also makes sense

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,280
that the cloud companies would be big

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,280
contributors

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,400
because we're benefiting a great deal

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,440
from open source

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,720
and i want to talk about that but really

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,760
i want to get away

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,440
a bit from talking about

00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,480
the big companies behind open source

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,359
and i want to talk about the people

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,880
behind open source and how people are

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,400
making software

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,000
open source software better in the cloud

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,760
and the first person i want to talk to

00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,319
about is dre spicer

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,960
a friend of mine who uh much more

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,839
importantly

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,000
well much more importantly to you as to

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,599
why he's important he's

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,799
the founder of drupal but that's not how

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,559
dries started when he started drupal he

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,520
didn't start drupal he was looking for a

00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,960
way to share

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,880
a quote-unquote high-speed adsl

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,240
internet connection as a student in

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,280
belgium

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,640
and he and his friends

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,480
were just looking for to build a

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,480
bulletin board well that little bulletin

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,200
board evolved into drupal which

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,520
last year or for the last major release

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,920
had

00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,079
10 000 different contributors to the

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,160
project it's an amazing example

00:56:52,079 --> 00:57:00,079
of open source success but getting from

00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:03,200
dries and his friends to dries

00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,280
and 10 000 of his friends and by the way

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,400
dries so he started a company called

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,200
aquia

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,960
and aquia despite being the largest

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,240
single contributor to

00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,760
to drupal accounted for less than five

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,040
percent of those total

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,640
contributions to the last release so how

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,680
did he get from

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,799
one person to ten thousand

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,480
well along the way in 2000 dries in a

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,559
conversation that i had with him he said

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,559
in 2000 it was a they were really

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,319
struggling to scale

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,559
drupal and part of that was mysql

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,680
mysql is a great open source database

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,599
but he was struggling

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,839
with all that as he said the hundreds of

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,920
knobs that he had to fiddle with

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,799
to get it to scale circa 2006

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,920
aws launches and suddenly that he's in

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,839
his words

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,960
that became dramatically easier and he

00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:58,000
says you have no

00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,000
idea the change that it made for drupal

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,160
in enabling them to scale it

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,920
so on the one hand thinking about cloud

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,880
one thing that cloud does

00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,480
is that it makes it so that individual

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,839
open source entrepreneurs and

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,440
entrepreneur i don't mean that they

00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,760
necessarily start a business i just mean

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,400
that they start a project

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,079
an open source entrepreneur finds it

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,720
dramatically easier

00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,599
to start and scale their project it's

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,799
one thing that the cloud does

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,680
another example a more recent example is

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,359
matt klein

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,440
with envoy envoy is this fantastic open

00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,280
source project that matt started

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,599
as as an engineer at lyft

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,400
in matt's words when he when he uh

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,119
started the

00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,520
envoy it started off just as an initial

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,359
in

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,960
an internal project they were trying to

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,599
move from

00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,680
a monolithic a monolith based

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,599
architecture to a microservices-based

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,680
architecture and so

00:58:53,599 --> 00:59:02,559
they he and and his team created envoy

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:04,240
great but then they decided

00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,079
well maybe we should open source this

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,920
and in matt's words

00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,520
he did this in part because he thought

00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,040
it'd be good for his career

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,040
lyft did it in part because they thought

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,440
it'd be great for recruiting

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,359
but it was an example of an of an

00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,040
individual

00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,640
uh person matt deciding that he wanted

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,920
to open source this thing and then

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,760
taking it out now

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,359
it's become this grace service mesh that

00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,520
a lot of different people use but it

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,960
started as him scratching

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,319
an itch for lyft and in thinking about

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,240
it in terms of we're seeing

00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,359
again coming back to that idea of the

00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,280
best software

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,440
will emerge from those who use the

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,799
software in dries's case it was

00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,920
restarting it to

00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:50,160
to share internet access at a university

00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,799
in belgium in matt's case

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,880
it was him sharing the software that

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,200
would enable

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
lyft to get a higher return on their

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,119
investment and envoy

00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,400
but they built it to support cloud

01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,079
native applications

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,079
at at lyft

01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:12,640
incidentally i asked matt recently

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,359
why don't we see more user driven open

01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,559
source and user driven open source

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:20,720
and i try not to swear so i won't quote

01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,839
him verbatim but he said

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:26,400
it's because it's so effing hard

01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,440
and he said but for my naivete i never

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,440
would have done this

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,720
but we're grateful that he did and now

01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,480
today

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,480
he's we have this great open source

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,480
project and by the way

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:41,599
um if you look at the contributors to it

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,680
at least 40 percent roughly 40 of that

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,280
code to contributed to envoys coming

01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,760
from google

01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,640
and so we see the cloud contributing

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,359
back

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,280
to uh to what it's created i want to go

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,839
to one more example

01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,480
and this is a madeleine olsen and it's

01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,480
the story

01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,000
of radiss but that story starts not with

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,799
madeleine it starts with salvatore

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,079
sanfilippo

01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,920
he was the founder of of redis and what

01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,559
salvatore started

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,040
uh read us he did it this also has

01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,319
another

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,319
mysql angle he did it not because

01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,839
he really wanted to start to build a new

01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,760
database he had no experience with

01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,960
database he says i had no idea what i

01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,599
was getting into i broke

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,920
all the rules on on database design

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:28,480
no one really would take an in-memory

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,880
database seriously at the time

01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,720
but he did it anyway and he started it

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,400
one thing that it didn't have

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,799
was encryption built in so madeline is

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,520
an engineer on the elasticash team at

01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:43,440
aws and i think roughly two years ago

01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,240
she and her manager decided hey you know

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,599
what

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:50,799
we depend in significant part on redis

01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,799
we should contribute back

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:56,000
well you don't just walk into mordor and

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,760
you don't just walk into an open source

01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,359
project and take over as

01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,119
take over that project so madeline

01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,760
started small and in her words

01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,359
she continued to be a relatively small

01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,359
contributor she did things like

01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,119
enable greater communication by starting

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,920
a slack channel

01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,359
for redis contributors she did other

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,920
things like

01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,400
preparing other people's contributions

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,440
to make

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,799
help them pass muster with salvatore and

01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,599
she did one thing

01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:25,760
that she didn't get actually her code uh

01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,359
accepted by salvatore

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,000
but she came up with the idea of how to

01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:32,720
get encryption built into radius

01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,079
and uh yasi got lieb one of the

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,000
contributors and

01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,920
salvatore reviewed it said decided that

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,240
they didn't want to take that

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,440
her code but liked the approach and so

01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,200
they

01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,440
used that approach and built their own

01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,480
code but it was little contributions

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,039
like that

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,359
that earned her good will with the team

01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,680
and then recently when redis decided or

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,880
the

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,839
the redis uh salvatore decided to leave

01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,280
redis to go pursue other things they

01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,880
came up with a new governance structure

01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,319
and madeline was asked to be one of the

01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,039
five maintainers

01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:06,240
along with three folks from redis labs

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,280
and zouzou from

01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:12,319
alibaba it's a great story

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,760
of how an individual

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,359
working at a cloud company because it

01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,599
was solving a

01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:19,200
particular cloud companies or scratching

01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,119
our itch

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,960
how she went from a small contributor to

01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,480
now a significant maintainer

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:29,599
but i think it also says a great deal

01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,520
about how open source can work in the

01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,480
cloud so here you start with salvatore

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,039
who by the way

01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,880
i wish i looked like salvatore these

01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,319
rugged good looks kind of looks like uh

01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,680
michael hutchins

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:45,280
um the former uh

01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,640
vote lead vocalist for nxs salvatore if

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,359
you're listening

01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,680
man crush on you the but you look at

01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,960
what

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:56,480
it went from salvatore to redis labs

01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,640
starting um to help fund the development

01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:03,119
of redis to where we are today

01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,720
with redis labs continuing to to fund a

01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,079
significant amount of the development

01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,960
around redis

01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,760
but also a number of cloud vendors

01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,720
building

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,640
managed redis services around redis it's

01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,039
a fantastic example and you say

01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,240
well surely this is cratered redis labs

01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,960
revenue

01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,880
i don't i'm not privy to their to their

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,319
numbers and i wouldn't divulge them if i

01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,839
were

01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,000
but in my conversations with them and

01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,520
they're a great partner of of aws

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
they're doing really really well it

01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,599
turns out that sharing

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:39,119
code and sharing and growing a pie

01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,680
is a good strategy so let's talk about

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,160
pie

01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,319
because like i said i really like pie

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,799
and bake a lot of pie

01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:48,079
let's do some pie related math so

01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,839
gartner said

01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:54,640
that in 2020

01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,359
even with coven global i.t spending

01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,920
should top

01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,440
about 3.9 trillion dollars a lot of

01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,280
money

01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,039
cloud and we spend a lot of time talking

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,440
about cloud and like figuring out who's

01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,559
winning in the cloud wars

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:12,240
well it's a relatively small piece of

01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:14,400
that overall pie 266 billion

01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,839
it's significant money but in the grand

01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,039
scheme of things

01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,039
it's a really small pie

01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,839
i was an english major and so i'm not

01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,280
necessarily great at math

01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:30,720
but i think what that means is that

01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,920
when we spend time agonizing and

01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,079
fighting

01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,520
over who's winning in the cloud and

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,319
who's

01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,400
his cloud chewing into open source etc

01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:42,799
we're talking we're fighting over six

01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,799
percent of that global i.t

01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:50,160
spend which is a little ridiculous

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:52,240
now we could say that well you know

01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,920
we've been conditioned to think about

01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,200
um in this way of we're conditioned to

01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,200
think about small pie

01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,440
martin mikos is a good friend and about

01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,000
15 years ago when he was ceo of mysql

01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,280
he's now ceo of hacker one

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,640
but he was ceo of mysql and

01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:13,599
he came up with this great quote saying

01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,319
for in open source he wanted to take a

01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,920
big market

01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,680
make it smaller and then take a big

01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,760
chunk of that market

01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:24,799
and we're kind of used to thinking about

01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,319
um when we talk about open source that

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,000
like saving money

01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,920
and we're we talk about cloud we talk

01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,920
about in the same way

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,240
and so we end up with this little small

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,760
pie it's a cute pie that's my um

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,640
strawberries and cream pie that i like

01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,359
to make but it's a small pie and i like

01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,280
pie

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:44,079
so i don't really want small pie so i

01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,960
had this conversation with simon wardley

01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,839
many of you have uh know simon and and i

01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,599
think he's

01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,280
i'm sure he's spoken here before in fact

01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,000
i think i've heard him speak at

01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,200
all things open before he introduced me

01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,119
to this idea of

01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:01,119
jevon's paradox and in a nutshell that

01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,920
idea is

01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:06,559
we normally think that when we save

01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,640
money when unit costs go down

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,000
that the overall pie is going to shrink

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,400
that the market will shrink because

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
people

01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,240
spend less money because they'll pocket

01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,280
those savings and move on turns out

01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:20,640
that's not how things work in real life

01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,359
when we save money on um

01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,319
on our cloud spent because of our cloud

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,319
spend

01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,160
we spend we end up spending more when we

01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:32,000
save more by moving to postgres

01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,920
we end up spending more on databases or

01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,720
on or on other services around it

01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,880
so the way that i read that is that

01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:45,280
instead of

01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:47,200
instead of the lower unit costs

01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,480
that cloud and open source together

01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,160
bring us instead of

01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,200
that turning into less pi it turns into

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,119
more

01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,640
the pi isn't shrinking it's getting

01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,520
bigger

01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,359
and by the way that applies to to the

01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:05,839
open source companies

01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:08,319
i saw just last week that uh databricks

01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,520
they i think i think they actually

01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,160
announced this that

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,760
they are now on a 350 million dollar run

01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,279
rate

01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,319
selling managed spark and other open

01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,159
source software

01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,679
well guess what databricks has healthy

01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:24,960
competition

01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:28,400
from from my company and from others

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,199
and they're doing great in part because

01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,640
a variety of contributors are growing

01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:35,600
that pie

01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,080
look at mongodb doing phenomenally well

01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,719
i think

01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,480
roughly 500 million in revenue now

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,920
almost half of which getting close to

01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,440
half of which comes from their cloud

01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,480
service atlas

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,880
which is fantastic and you go down the

01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,239
list

01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,520
confluent recently well last year

01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,480
raised money on a huge valuation doing

01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,120
really really well in terms of revenue

01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,359
um

01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,719
elastic same thing redis labs data

01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,560
stacks

01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,560
hashicorp all these open source

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,120
companies doing really well

01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,600
and i would argue they're doing really

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,719
well

01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,719
precisely because they've embraced cloud

01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,400
and early on we had some friction

01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:17,440
because

01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,120
over licensing gymnastics but i think

01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,920
that was just a moment in time

01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,199
i think it was just it it gave us time

01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,600
until we got to the point

01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,279
where we realized the cloud is not

01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,319
competitive to open source

01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,440
it's an enabler for open source it makes

01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,560
it so that

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,440
end users can focus more time on getting

01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,080
work done

01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,279
rather than on doing the

01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:42,480
undifferentiated heavy lifting of

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:44,480
setting up and managing infrastructure

01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,319
it's a really good thing what we have

01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,359
now

01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,000
i want to end with um somebody who i

01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,000
think is

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,120
extraordinarily smart adam jacob he was

01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,480
the

01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,560
co-founder and cto at chef and

01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,840
uh and now the co-founder of system

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,080
initiative

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,520
and he talks about cloud and open source

01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,640
in this way

01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,600
he says you can think of it as

01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,640
competitive or you can think of it

01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,360
as a way of growing that overall

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,920
um the top of funnel or again in my

01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,440
words

01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,960
uh growing the pie

01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,880
and i remember having this conversation

01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,480
with a friend um that i had worked with

01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,040
when i was at mongodb

01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,000
and uh we were at re invent aws re

01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,640
invent

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,080
back when we were able to go and talk to

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,679
people in person

01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:36,960
and it just struck me at that time that

01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,040
we those two companies but in general

01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,280
we were wasting a lot of time fighting

01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,000
over relatively small

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,719
pieces of pie and that it would be much

01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,280
better

01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,159
for each of us to go out and build that

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:53,440
pie contribute to that upstream

01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:55,840
open source project and we've seen that

01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,880
at my company we've seen that with most

01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,280
recently with

01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,320
radiss but also graphql and a number of

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,840
other projects

01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,719
and if you look across those cloud

01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,760
companies people are doing i think

01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,920
a pretty good job of doing that

01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,600
we've had to figure it out over time but

01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,400
my sense

01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,920
is that there's this great opportunity

01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,040
for all of us

01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,679
to build these open source pies

01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,640
open source communities together we need

01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,719
to be a little bit

01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,199
patient with each other there's it's

01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,159
easy to make accusations and assume that

01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,239
we know

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:32,159
what other people are thinking we assume

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,800
we know why they do the things that

01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,199
that they do whether on an individual

01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,520
level

01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:41,840
or on a macro level on a company level

01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,440
i just ask that we be a little bit more

01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,560
thoughtful of each other and that we

01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,320
remember

01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,800
open source is ultimately about

01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,760
community it's ultimately about

01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,800
people it's ultimately about enabling

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,480
those people

01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:59,600
and as we do that we do something that

01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,440
makes me really happy and that is we

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,520
grow the open source pie

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:09,840
thank you very much and todd again thank

01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:09,840
you for having me i really appreciate it

01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,560
