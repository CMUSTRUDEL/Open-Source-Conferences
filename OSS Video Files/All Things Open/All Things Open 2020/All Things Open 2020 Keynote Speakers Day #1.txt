Description: 
	Talk #1 - Erica Brescia - COO, GitHub
The Next 50 Million Developers
We all rely on the ever-growing body of open source software that serves as the building blocks powering much of the modern world. In order to support this continued growth — both to maintain the software we already have and create the software of the future — the Open Source community will double in size in the next five years. Erica Brescia, chief operating officer at GitHub, will share insight into the incredible growth and global expansion occurring in Open Source, and the evolution that is necessary to attract the talent and potential of the next 50 million developers.

Talk #2 - Shedrack Akintayo - Cloud Foundry Foundation
Open Source in Africa 
According to Github reports earlier this year, A certain number of African countries have been listed amount top contributors to open source and also users of Github. Countries like, Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana were all listed. In this talk, I’ll talk about how open source is shaping the future of software development in Africa, very important communities supporting open source in Africa, and key players supporting open source in Africa. I’ll also suggest better ways companies in more developed countries around the globe can support Open Source development and Software in Africa.

Talk #5 - Matt Asay, Amazon Web Services
The Future of Open Source Looks like Cloud
It’s 2020 and some open-source companies keep fighting one of the best things to have happened to open source: cloud computing. This is a mistake, but it’s not one we need to keep repeating. In this talk, I’ll dig into what’s happening in open source licensing and strategies and how the cloud will shape (and improve) our open-source future.

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,080
uh again we've got many many people

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
watching this live so

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
i'm todd lewis i'm the chair of all

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
things open i created the event

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
uh a number of years ago maybe nine

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
years ago or so been in the open source

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
space for a long time for more than a

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
decade

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
i guess that's going on 15 years now

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
honestly so i can't believe it's been

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
that long

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,480
i used to be the youngest person in the

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
room and now i'm one of the older people

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
in the room

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,239
so it's incredible uh how that's

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
happened a lot of you watching can

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,960
probably relate to that

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
i didn't think it would ever happen to

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
me but here i am but anyway um it's

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399

joining from

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,119
you know one of the benefits of doing a

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,799
virtual event is that we truly

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,880
everyone can join people can join from

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
all over the world which i know is the

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
case here we were looking at the

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
registration list

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
thousands and thousands and thousands of

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
people registered and really you're

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,960

planet all

over the globe which is really kind of

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,240
cool so again i know it's a different

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
time for everybody wherever you happen

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,479

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,479
that that does happen

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,439
for those of you that have joined us

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
live before you know this is exactly

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,000
almost

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
exactly what you would be seeing if you

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,799
were here live

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
i would be actually i'm sitting on this

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
stage i'm at the raleigh convention

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,119
center

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
and the seats are behind me we're up on

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
the fourth floor ballrooms

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
if we were live these ballrooms would be

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
jammed at this point with about three to

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,200
four thousand people

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
the vibe would be amazing it would be

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,680
energy and electricity in this room

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,360
not quite the case this year but again

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
things haven't exactly this is what

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
isn't exactly what we had in mind

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
but this is going to be amazing this is

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
again going to be fantastic

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
i'm going to just talk through a couple

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
of things before we get started again if

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,959
we were here in person i would be doing

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,400
exactly the same thing right i'd be on

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
this stage and i'd be holding this piece

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
of paper

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
and i would be going through my

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
announcements to make sure that i hit

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
everything

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
and frankly i would have a five hour

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
energy in my hand those of you that know

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
me know that would be absolutely true

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,319
and i've got a five hour energy right

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
here on the desk with me today so

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
no everything is the same nothing has

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,440
changed at all

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,599
again uh so this is our eighth year we

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,959
started all things open in 2013 we've

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
seen tremendous growth

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,160
and this year again it's gonna be the

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,599
biggest and the best event ever 200

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,080
speakers and two into

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
200 sessions some of those are extended

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,280
workshops some of those are keynote

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,720
sessions some of those are 40

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
traditional 45-minute conference

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
sessions

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
and again this is two days this is two

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
days of content

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,040
so if you're out there and you're

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,159
joining us today we certainly hope that

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,640
you come back tomorrow

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
a little bit of a why some of you are

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
joining us for the very first time ever

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
you've never attended an all things open

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,159
event you heard about this maybe

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
via social media or friend or colleague

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,000
we have been in the open source space i

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,480
personally have as i said when i opened

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
10 to 15 years i've watched the growth

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,400
going back 10 15 years the open source

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,799
space was completely different right

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,440
it was still viewed as maybe something

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
that only

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,280
a select few people engaged in and

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,599
contributed to it wasn't viewed

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
necessarily as mainstream some of you

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
that have only been in the space for you

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
know a short period of time that might

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,280
be hard to believe because it's so

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
ubiquitous today

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
it wasn't always like that so when i got

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
started it very much wasn't like that

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,239
but i knew something was happening

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
and i very much wanted to start

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,319
conferences and events uh to showcase

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
what was going on and what i knew would

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,560
really impact the world and change the

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,159
world

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
and sure enough fast forward more than a

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,799
decade later and that's exactly what has

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,599
happened so that's

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,879
incredibly exciting we believe that most

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
of the innovation

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
that we see in technology the best you

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,159
know technology improving

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
is due to the contributions of open

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,000
source contributors and people

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
in the community crowdsourcing from all

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
over the world

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,280
uh again people's contributions within

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
the open source context we think that

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
that's incredibly exciting

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,479
and a very very good thing so better

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
technology is resulting and again

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,840
in my opinion in our opinion we take the

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
position that most of the innovation

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
that you're seeing is a direct result of

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
open source so

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,600
we're that's one reason why we started

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
this we wanted to showcase a lot of that

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
innovation a lot of the processes that

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
go into making that possible

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,800
we also wanted to uh really present

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
opportunity to people

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
for me personally and our team we feel

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
like open source is a huge source of

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,759
opportunity it's a great

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
it's a gateway if you will to

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,320
opportunity you can get in and begin to

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
contribute

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
while contributing uh you can you can be

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,320
heard you can have an immediate impact

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
but you can also network and make

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
connections connections that can benefit

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
you now

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,960
and years into the future so we really

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
truly believe and view open source as a

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,479
gateway to opportunity

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,919
so we use our events as a way to

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,479
showcase that opportunity

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,160
and as yet another in-person opportunity

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,080
to really make that gateway available to

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
as many people as we possibly can

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
we're big on participation and

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
contribution from the very beginning we

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
focused on inclusion and diversity we

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
want

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
diverse viewpoints and perspectives

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,240
engaged and contributing to our events

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
we've done codes of conduct from the

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
very beginning for more than a decade

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
and we're extremely proud of that we

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
have one today by the way that

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
will be strictly enforced so uh in all

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
of our communication it's the first

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
thing that we always mention

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
which is our code of conduct again we're

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
extremely proud of it we're adamant

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
about it

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
and we expect everyone to adhere but

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,199
that is again part of our theme and it's

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
part of what we believe

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,400
our principles and sort of our guiding

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
principles so that's really what all

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
things open and what we do is about

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
that's why we do it

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
a little history for those of you

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
joining us for the first time we've seen

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
tremendous growth of this conference

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
you've

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,520
maybe by now watch the videos of past

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,520
events either from 2019

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,759
even the 2020 introduction on the home

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
page of a virtual platform this year

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
sort of you know showed the crowd and

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
from years past and watched a lot of the

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
engagement and networking that our

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,240
attendees

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
do at our events in 2013 we did this

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,479
event for the very first time

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
700 people or so attended it was pretty

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
amazing

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,759
we still had again about

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,520
700 people in 2013. in 2014 that number

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,560
increased to 11 or 1200

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,360
in 2015 that number increased uh to

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,840
about 16

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,800
1700 and then in 2017 that number

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,160
increased to about 3 200 in 2018 the

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
number jumped to 41

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
and then last year in 2019 the number

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
increased to right at 5 000 people so

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
those of you that were with us last year

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
in raleigh the rtp which is where we're

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
based it's home for us

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
you joined and you attended this event

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
with about 5 000 people so

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
we're very grateful we're super super

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
thankful for the growth and again we

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
believe that

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,039
the fact that we really focus on

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
inclusion and diversity and and really

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,319
getting everyone to the table and making

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
sure they do have a place at the table

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
to participate has been a major

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
contributing factor so we've actually

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
we're well over that number this year

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
from the number of registrations

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,080
and again we're just very very excited

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,680
about that very very thankful

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,360

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,640
engaging in different activities we're

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,399
doing things for the very first time

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,920
much like you are this is a different

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,760
world the world is a different place

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,519
than it was just six months ago

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
and everybody is adjusting accordingly

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,800
and doing the best they can so

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,160
with all that said absolutely the same

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,279
goes for us while you're on the site

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,120
you're going to see

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,639
some things you know maybe not go the

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,160
way that they should or function

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
properly or the way that you expect them

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
to function

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
if you would just let us know we'll

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
address those quickly i promise

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,079
and we're going to do the best to help

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
you out that we possibly can and finally

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,519
again thank you everybody that knows me

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
i'm a thank you machine

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,959
and it's because uh you know i've lived

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
long enough to truly appreciate

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
uh the fact that you're here again we

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
don't take that for granted you could be

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
anywhere

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
literally in the world you could be

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
joining any other virtual event you've

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
decided to be here with us today

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,200
we never ever take that for granted and

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
i do just want to thank you profusely

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
again

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
i'll probably thank you again maybe five

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
or six times uh within this segment

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
within the keynote block

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
quite honestly and again those that know

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
me personally and have attended our

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
events before

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,040
know that i absolutely do that so with

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,320
all that said i've got about 9 14 so

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,839
we're right on schedule

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
i do want to go now to our keynote

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,120
speakers they're standing by they've

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
joined us

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
literally from all over the world let me

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,760
tell you a little bit about why we chose

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,079
our keynote speakers

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
we chose keynote speakers based on

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
topics

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,040
we wanted them to present topics that

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,040
were widely applicable that were of

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,200
interest to a large number of people

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,200
but were that impactful right impactful

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
topics really influencing

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,120
uh the open source space and influencing

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
technology in general so

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,880
that was the criteria all of our

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,480
speakers are world-class individuals

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
they're true professionals they've all

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,680
been great to work with

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
amazing to work with in the time leading

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,519
up to the event so i want to thank

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
all of our keynote speakers for being

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,079
with us today they're amazing

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
individuals and they really do a great

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
job

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
and the talks that they're going to

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,959
deliver are really really great and

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,519
again they're joining us from all over

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,959
the world

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
that's one of the advantages of going

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
virtual is that you can literally talk

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
to and bring in people from all over the

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
globe

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
we think that's really cool it's kind of

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
neat and we're certainly trying to

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
demonstrate that and engage in that and

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,120
do that this morning so

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
what we're going to do i'm about to

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
bring in people literally live from all

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
over the globe so

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
with that everyone joining this session

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
has looked at your schedule

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,639
people

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,079
uh certainly in this keynote block

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,800
joining us from the west coast so it's

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
very early

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,959
we greatly appreciate that erica i've

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
we've we've all admired your work

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
uh with again things that you've done in

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
the past and now in your current role

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,079
with github so

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,600
we're we're thrilled to have uh to have

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
you here and thrilled to host you

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
so a note to our viewers and everyone

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,000
attending erica's talk is going to be

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
recorded

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
uh shortly i'm going to

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
to turn off my mic and turn off my

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
camera here a little

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
inside baseball and then i'm going to

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,839
begin to share my screen and play

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,880
her talk which again is recorded uh it's

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,880
an amazing talk

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,199
it's it's very well done as you would

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,560
expect and then uh what will happen is

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,240
erica will be live

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
to answer your questions so if you're

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,360
watching the talk you can engage in

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
communication

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
with erica we encourage comments

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,760
questions here's what i want you to do

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
this is a webinar right this is a zoom

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
webinar so at the bottom of your screen

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,240
you're seeing three options right one is

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,480
q a

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
one is chat and one is raise your hand

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,760
for today's purposes our keynote block

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
we're only going to utilize

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
q a in chat raise your hand none of our

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
speakers are going to recognize you and

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
we're not going to enable your audio

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,519
which is something you can do in zoom

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,959
but we're not going to do that so i

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,480
would ask that if you've got questions

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
and you want to direct them specifically

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
to erica

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,360
that you can do so focus on the q a

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,120
feature and erica on your end i would

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
ask you to focus on q a

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
because here's what happens in chat so

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,920
many people are going to be submitting

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
comments and everything in the chat

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,440
feature that those are going to stack on

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,639
top of one another and chances are your

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
question might be lost

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,920
and it's going to be difficult for our

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,519
speakers to kind of keep up and track

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
questions specific to them

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,800
so if you want to pose a question

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,279
certainly to erica here during the first

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,240
talk in the first recording please do so

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,920
she's live

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,360
and she will respond to you directly

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,720
maybe not she won't be able to get to

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,000
everybody but she'll do the best that

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,000
she can

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
which we again really really appreciate

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
so again focus on

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
q a not necessarily on chat but you know

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
that she's going to be scanning both of

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
them

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
okay so with all of that with that intro

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
again i'm going to disable my microphone

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
and my camera and i'm going to bring her

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,920
presentation up and play her recording

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,600
so

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,079
here we go hello thanks for having me

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,000
and thanks to everyone joining today

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
while i miss seeing friends in person

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,240
the shift of virtual events has had a

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
huge impact on making conferences like

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
ato

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
more accessible to folks all over the

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,759
world

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,199
and that's actually pretty relevant

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,519
about what i'm here to talk to you

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,759
about today so let's dive in

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,079
the amount of software that we the human

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,720
race will rely on in the coming decades

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,600
will grow

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639
exponentially our cars will continue to

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
get smarter

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
software will continue to help us

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
diagnose treat and even prevent

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
illnesses

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,440
it will help us improve the health of

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
our planet as we develop solutions to

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,320
combat

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,920
climate change food shortages and

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
resource constraints

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,279
and behind all of that is the open

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
source community

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,799
a community that of course many of you

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,160
watching today

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,600
are a critical part of in order to

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,679
support this growth

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,520
to maintain the software that we already

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,400
have and create the software of the

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,480
future

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
we need the open source community to

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
grow too

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,919
we need more developers more maintainers

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,079
and more contributors

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,120
to meet the ever increasing demands for

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
software

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,400
it's basically more more of it all i

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
guess

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,360
and what's amazing is how quickly we're

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,840
already seeing this happen

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
so how do we the existing open source

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,320
communities support this growth

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,679
how do we pave a path for new developers

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
and ensure the innovation

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
and quality of this community continues

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,679
to grow along with its size

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
how do we give some of the tireless

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,559
maintainers out there

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,720
a much deserved break to support the

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,440
continued growth and health of open

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,679
source

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
we need to create an open source culture

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
where anyone can be a contributor

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,400
and grow to be a maintainer we need to

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,640
continue to unleash the network effects

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
of

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
every commit and perhaps most

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
significantly

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
we need to enable local and global

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,320
commercial opportunity through open

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,360
source

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,880
first let's talk about contributors and

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
the importance of open source

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
development

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,600
as a viable career path today

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
there are over 50 million developers on

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,679
github

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,480
in five years we expect that number to

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,880
double

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,320
that's a hundred million developers who

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,320
are going to be critical to the

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,679
acceleration of human progress in the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
coming decades

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
they're going to come from all over the

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,440
world but especially from developing

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
nations where learning to code

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
and contributing to open source is a

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,039
path to economic growth

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
and prosperity this is a map of where in

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
the world

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,799
contributions on github are happening

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
today

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,280
five years ago the majority of open

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
source contributions were being made in

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,600
the western world

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,320
over time we start to see more and more

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,400
regions growing in terms of contributors

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,240
and now you can see that the epicenter

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,080
of open source contribution is

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
actually moving away from the western

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,679
world as we move into the future

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,000
we see places like india china africa

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
and latin america really start to light

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,799
up

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,160
just check out the map there is an

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,160
acceleration happening

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
in open source contributions from

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,919
outside the western world

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
and this is going to intensify over the

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,520
next five to ten years

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
i'm going to share a stat that still

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,559
boggles my mind my son is seven

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,160
and in his lifetime eighty percent of

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,799
the world population

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,720
will reside in asia and africa the

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,559
developing world is really going to

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
drive a lot of the innovation and

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,000
progress we're going to see in the next

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,720
few decades and the world is going to be

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,240
richer more dynamic and more inclusive

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,559
because of this interconnected

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,520
open source community that we're all

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,280
continuing to build together

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
let's zoom into the impact that open

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,760
source can have on someone's life

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,880
this is sonya john a blockchain

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
developer writer

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
and speaker in kenya who recently

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,760
participated in the github readme

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,559
project

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,880
she was 25 when hyperinflation hit south

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,559
sudan and she lost her job and 90

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,240
percent of her savings

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,240
she felt like she had lost everything

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
and was starting to get desperate

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
in her own words she moved to kenya

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,080
bought a cheap laptop and installed

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
ubuntu because that's what she had heard

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,840
programmers do

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
and taught herself how to code she

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,840
didn't have a degree in computer science

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
or an internship with a software company

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,960
she had a laptop and she had

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,960
determination

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
the first time someone offered to pay

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
her for a project she just didn't

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,440
believe it

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
but she built a messenger bot earned her

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
first paycheck as a developer and

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
discovered the enormous opportunity that

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,919
had opened up to her

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,919
sonia's story is so inspiring there are

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,760
brilliant gifted people all over the

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,520
world right now who haven't unlocked

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,559
their potential to contribute to open

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,720
source

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,320
as we look ahead to the dramatic rise in

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,159
software development that is coming in

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,919
the next five years and beyond

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
we need to seek out these folks and

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,240
create a path to open source

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,320
contribution

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,400
and in turn financial opportunity

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
we need to make it possible for talented

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,120
developers to have a thriving

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
successful career in open source to get

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
paid for their work

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,480
to grow their careers and contribute

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,520
their talent to a space where it has the

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,400
potential to have

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,240
enormous impact i'll share some thoughts

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,559
on some specific ways that you can help

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
with this a bit later

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,880
we've seen what kind of opportunity open

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,960
source can bring to one person

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
let's now flip that and look at this

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
from the other perspective

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,600
let's look at the network effect of a

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
single commit to an open source project

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
for this example we picked a commit to

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,280
tensorflow

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,679
in june of 2020. this is a real

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
contribution contributed by a single

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
developer

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
that commit helps improve tensorflow

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
which we know is being used widely

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
around the globe

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
in the four months that have passed

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,919
since it was made more than 4 500

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,000
developers from over a hundred countries

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,960
have worked directly on the tensorflow

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
project

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
but this is only the tip of the iceberg

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,360
let's now look at all the projects that

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,200
have leveraged and directly depend on

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,919
this version of tensorflow

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,320
that single commit is now included in

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,600
about

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,400
23 500 projects on github

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,039
anchored in 137 countries around the

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,120
world

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
and so far it has been included in the

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,679
work of more than 50

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,360
000 developers from 151 countries

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,080
the reach of a single commit is

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
incredible this is a compounding effect

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,760
of a single contribution

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,360
think about the exponential impact a

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
single developer can have in their

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,640
career

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
multiply that by 100 million and just

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
imagine

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,919
what this community can do it honestly

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,280
gives me goosebumps to think about the

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,280
magnitude of what can be achieved

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,880
i love this example of just what commit

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
can lead to

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,200
this is evan yu another maintainer who

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,000
participated in the github readme

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
project

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,919
he started an open source project called

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
vue with the intention of building a

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,559
simple javascript library that he could

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,640
reference to improve his own efficiency

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,000
he never intended to be a full-time open

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
source maintainer but

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
you can get where this is going that's

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
exactly what he does today

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
when he open sourced the project people

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
started using it

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,000
the community adapted his idea built on

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,679
it and ultimately helped it evolved into

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
a thriving global community of

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
maintainers

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
contributors and users one thing i love

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,679
about vue is that evan's vision for the

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
project is to give any user a low

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
barrier of entry a good foundation and

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,039
room to grow

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,960
he said that the ideal user is someone

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,640
who just got into web development and

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
they're intentionally designing a way

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
for folks to start building without

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,919
having an understanding

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
of how front end development actually

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,760
works

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,000
it's this mindset that can give have a

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,480
huge impact on lowering the barrier of

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
entry for new developers to open source

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,840
if you began with the foundation of a

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,000
single contributor

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,840
and has evolved to become an integral

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,720
part of developer workflows

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
and best of all it's now fully funded by

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,200
the community

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,960
it serves i told you about sonya john

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,880
earlier and she said something that i

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,120
think is so insightful

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,360
she said when i'm building solutions and

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,279
decide to keep them closed i recognize

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
that this removes an opportunity for

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,279
somebody else

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,799
so most of my work is open source the

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,600
potential the community is

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,600
absolutely massive and every project

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,679
every commit is a building block

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,400
that the next 50 million developers will

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,320
be able to learn from and build on so we

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
all need to focus on getting more people

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,440
to that first commit

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,880
because of course that's where it all

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,960
starts

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
so we've talked about the impact that

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
open source can have on sony in other

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
people's lives

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,679
and we've talked about the value of a

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,000
commit so

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,320
let's talk a little bit about money the

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
growth of open source community has

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,039
real economic impact according to the

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,520
corn ferry institute

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
demand for skilled workers will outstrip

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
supply

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,679
in the next 10 years resulting in a

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,960
global talent shortage of more than 85.2

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
million people

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
if left unchecked the financial impact

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,640
of this talent shortage could reach more

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,840
than 8.4 trillion

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,240
in unrealized annual revenue by 2030.

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,159
this is equivalent to the combined gdps

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
of germany and japan

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,600
obviously these numbers are for a

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,840
broader group than just developers this

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,159
is

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,840
all skilled workers but an increasing

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,919
number of these jobs will require

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,880
technical fluency if not straight coding

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,720
skills

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
open source will play a key role in

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
closing this gap and in doing so has the

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,919
power to help accelerate emerging

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,600
economies

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,960
let's take a look at one incredibly

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,080
inspiring program

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,760
related to this laboratory is a social

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
entrepreneurship program in latin

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
america that trains women who have been

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
unable to start careers in web

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
development or ux design

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,559
the organization then connects these

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,159
women with companies and helps them

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,640
launch a career in tech

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,840
since its inception laboratoria has

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,400
trained over 1600 women and 78

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,240
of them have started technology careers

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
in 17 industries

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,720
that kind of success can have a huge

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,720
impact on a local economy

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,279
here's the story of one woman whose life

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,880
was changed thanks to laboratoria

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,640
chireni azkaraga is from puebla mexico

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,559
she had to leave a career in music that

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,400
she loved she started walking and

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,400
training neighbors dogs to make a living

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,480
in order to support her family

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,799
she applied and was accepted to the

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,760
laboratoria training program where she

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,320
trained as a ux

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,400
designer she's now a web developer who

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,480
draws on her experience in the arts and

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,640
in dog training to guide users through a

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,320
well-orchestrated application experience

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
for the program

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
i share this story because there are

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
several things that i talked about today

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,600
that form the bigger picture of the

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,760
opportunity ahead

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,760
we need the next 50 million developers

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,120
to continue to carry the open source

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,799
community forward

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,720
and to create the software we'll all

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,200
depend on in the future

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,000
there is so much untapped talent all

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,760
over the world

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,679
and so many people are seeking

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,520
opportunities to improve their lives

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,720
through professional achievement

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,720
financially or often both

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,880
that talent has the potential to have

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,279
lasting positive impact

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
not only on the lives of individuals but

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
on innovation

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,880
and economic growth both locally and

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,840
more broadly

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,399
but together we must continue to remove

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,399
barriers

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
in major league hacking's most recent

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,559
hacker census

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,159
which is a survey of almost a hundred

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,840
thousand collegiate hackathon

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,559
participants

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,399
nearly 62 percent of respondents said

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,600
that they had not contributed to open

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,640
source yet

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,159
among them close to 92 percent believe

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
that contributing to open source

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
in the future will be important for

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,039
their career the main thing holding them

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
back

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,399
is that they feel like they don't know

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,760
how to get started

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,320
or that they aren't skilled enough

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,480
organizations like laboratoria and the

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,480
vue project are doing amazing work

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,799
bringing more people into tech and open

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,320
source and lowering the barriers to

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,640
getting started

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,760
there are so many ways that we can all

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,919
get involved

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
in paving the way for new developers to

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
join the open source community

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
i picked a few great examples but this

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,279
is far from an

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,120
exhaustive list google summer of code

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,399
which i'm sure virtually all of you have

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,399
heard of by now

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,240
is a program focused on bringing more

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,840
student developers from around the world

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,320
to open source

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,679
outreachy organizes three-month paid

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,520
internships with free

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,720
and open source software projects for

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,600
people who are typically

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,679
underrepresented in those projects

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,000
open collective gives open source

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,720
projects a transparent way to collect

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,039
funding and manage their finances

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
community bridge brings together project

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,440
maintainers contributors and users to

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,919
fund open source projects

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
improve code security and boost the size

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,440
and diversity of open source communities

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,919
of course at github we have github

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,080
sponsors which enables companies and

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,520
individuals to sponsor projects or

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,000
specific developers

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,120
making open source careers possible for

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
contributors

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,880
i'd encourage everyone to consider

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,640
sponsoring an individual or a team

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
that's doing work that's important to

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,919
you

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
the major league hacking fellowship

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,480
provides educational curriculum and

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,840
practical experience that new developers

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,799
can put on their resumes

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,640
right away companies can sponsor fellows

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,840
to work on specific projects within

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,480
their organization

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,880
or open source projects in general to

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,120
help

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,760
more people enter into careers as

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,159
developers

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,520
these projects and platforms are always

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,080
seeking supporters

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,039
financial sponsors and mentors to fuel

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,720
their growth

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,880
so i encourage you to get involved in

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,720
one or more if you're not already

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,159
whether that's shining a light on the

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,720
incredible work that they do

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,799
supporting them financially or acting as

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,559
a mentor for folks going through their

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,720
programs

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,799
in addition think about the global

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,960
nature of the developer community

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,960
build your projects and your communities

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,559
with the needs of developers around the

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,320
world in mind

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,559
do you need to change anything for your

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,840
software to be useful for folks in

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,360
emerging economies and mobile first

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,159
markets what about places without

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,320
fast internet what about your community

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,919
is it welcoming to new developers

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,159
those from different backgrounds and

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,080
parts of the world and of course

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,480
how do you think about accessibility to

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,000
be available and useful for as many

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
folks as possible

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,760
i know there's lots of food for thought

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
here and a ton of great talks out there

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,720
by others

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,799
on details around building our projects

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
and communities to be more inclusive and

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,279
accessible

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,279
so i encourage you to take a look at

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
those

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,039
what started with a small group of

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
academics and researchers back

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,039
in the 50s and 60s and led to the free

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,720
software movement in the 80s and the

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,120
launch of the open source movement in

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,840
the 90s is now a community

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,600
of 50 million people whose efforts and

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,960
contributions have helped

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,159
define the world as we know it today

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,600
because of you the pace of new software

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,120
is blazingly fast with components for

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,399
almost anything readily available

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,120
because of you there is an abundance of

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,240
exceptionally high quality software

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,080
freely available

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,440
for everyone to use and to build on and

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,600
because of you

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,000
people around the world can learn from

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,760
the vast array of knowledge and best

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,679
practices shared openly

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,559
helping pave the way for new

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,519
contributors to open source

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,799
it took decades to grow the community to

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,200
this size

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,000
with your help in just the next few

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
years

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,679
we'll pave the way for the next 50

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,080
million developers

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,320
so that open source can continue to be a

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,760
key source of innovation global

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,600
collaboration

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,240
and an engine of human progress

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,360
here's to being a hundred million strong

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,559
thanks for all you do

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,120
and thanks for being here today okay

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,240
so i think i'm back live i should be

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
erica thank you

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,679

us wonderful talk

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,960
great topic obviously it's one we care

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
very much about and we've been on for a

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
while also

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,760
it's amazing to see that growth and

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
you're right the statistic that shocked

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,120
you

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,559
uh 80 of the world's population will be

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,720
in those two areas

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,000
when i heard you say that shocking to me

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,880
as well so

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,320
uh it's it was a real eye-opener we knew

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,399
that number was large but i didn't

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,320
really realize that it was that large so

00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,519
thank you thanks again for being with us

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,519
live in the chat so

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,840
all of our attendees and everyone that's

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,159
live with us right now in this session

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
again erica is going to stay with us and

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,320
continue to engage with you

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,200
in chat and in qa feature so if you have

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,880
a question

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
specifically for erica i would encourage

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
you to again

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,760
leverage the q a pose it to her there

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,679
and she's going to you know

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,679
be on the lookout for those questions

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,679
and she'll also scan chat but again

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,200
chat's tough only because the messages

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,559
as you know they stack on top of each

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,000
other it's real time

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,000
so it's a little difficult to follow the

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
conversation there so we're encouraging

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,039
everybody with questions again one last

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,760
time to post those

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,519
to erica via the qa feature so erica

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,360
again thank you very much it's early for

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,240
you very gracious to join us

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,039
and wonderful job as always so with that

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,080
and i think these

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,919
this next talk segues really nicely uh

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,600
from from erica's talk really because

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,240
the topics are very related

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,080
uh we've got um shedrick akintayo of the

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
cloud foundry foundation with us

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,760
the title of the talk title of

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,679
shedrick's talk is open source in africa

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,519
so again it really does work well kind

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,240
of flows nicely from the talk that erica

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,080
just gave

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,960
that's why we sequenced them like this

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,359
it's why that we placed this one after

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,399
and following erica's talk so shedrick

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,839
is one

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,159
someone that i referenced earlier right

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,639
shedrick is joining us live from africa

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,639
and we really appreciate him being here

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,560
so um shedrick with all of that

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,480

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,280
is growing we have about 59 percent

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,320
growth in nigeria which is really really

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
um crazy um we also have about 44

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,079

fruits in kenya and we've had um

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,440
groups from about 40 percent in tunisia

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,240
and morocco

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,720

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,480
like

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,560

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,960
so seriously we can see that nigeria has

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,200
the highest um

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,200

taking on open source up to the next

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
level and we've had

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,359
collectively about 70 more contributors

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,200

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,359
oscar so

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,960
open source community africa obviously

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,839
community africa is like a community of

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,200
creatives

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,359
driving the open source movement in

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,640
africa it was basically created to

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,640
encourage more african

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,599
and also um

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,520
advocate for open source movements in

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,240

a community for both designers for both

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,079
technical writers for both developers to

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,880
come together

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,960

which is really really um a very very

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,640
good mark for us here in

um you can use a really great team we've

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,520
had people like sarah

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,960
um jaz now we have people um very very

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,200
big players in the open source talk

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
about our material p night team and how

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,560
useful it is we've had various people

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,119
make um setting

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,319

now the free software and open source

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,359
foundation for africa um

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,920
so it's basically headed by the u.n and

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,760
um it basically brings people from

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
various parts of africa to come up

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,560
and learn more about um open source and

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:56,079
also um learn more about coding

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,640
now how to provide um support for oss in

00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,560
africa

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,079
i think uh erica said something

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,520
generally about how to provide support

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,280
to people in on purpose us

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,280
uh but i want to like narrow it down to

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,560
just africa and we need more people to

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,839
sponsor more companies more

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,040
organizations more

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,680
um foundations to sponsor oss events in

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,640
africa

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,480
currently we've had just um we had just

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,720
open source community africa pushing

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,720
this pushing for this event uh we also

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,920
need to provide um osa we also need

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,760
these companies and

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,520
organizations and foundations to provide

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,440
oss learning supports for

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,760
um people here in africa we also need to

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,640
we need more oss initiative establishing

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,119
africa because

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,960
a lot of people are still like lacking

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,920
behind when it comes to open source um a

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,800
lot of people still don't understand

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,599
what it means

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,720
so when more initiatives are created for

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,319
people to see how

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,480
um open source work a lot of people

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,599
don't understand it then we'll see a

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,240
better increase

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,839
um in open source here in africa we need

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,920
to we need more people to provide the

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,720
voice for african oss creators and

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,640
contributors

00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,400
they love oss critical economies because

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,880
here in africa are doing great stuff

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,240
um that that they are hardly recognized

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,720
so uh we need people to

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,920
um help us reach out to these oss

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
creators and the contributors here in

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,400
africa

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,079
provide get them or get them on

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,440
interviews to talk about their products

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,319
talk about things they are doing

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,839
um it's it's really served as an

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,800
incentive for more people to get into

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,839
open source because

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,200
a lot of people feel like they're not

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,160
appreciated enough because i mean the

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,079
africans but

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,280
um when we provided an enable

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,440
environment for people

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,280
for oss creators and contributors then

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,160
um would have a better increase

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,800
in um open source contributions here in

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,880
africa

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,880
so one very important is higher more

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,640
thing is hire more folks from africa i

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,119
mean we have great people here

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,880
that are working that very intelligent

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,800
very brilliant i mean if when companies

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,240
come here to africa to see that

00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
um we have good people put um providing

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,079
open source support doing a lot of open

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,200
source

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,839
um contribution um you would see that

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,119
this would provide um a sense of like

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,520
okay this is i'm great

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,040
so we can call it i'm currently start um

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,000
providing more support for people here

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,160
in africa and this

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,599
city this will increase the um growth of

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,720
open source here in africa i mean there

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,440
are a lot of open source companies

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,800
around the world

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,640
so this is this isn't something that

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,880
should be that difficult um

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,680
also one very and very last point is

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,520
promote

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,760
open source from africa github has been

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,000
doing a very um great job promoting open

some slides and then he's going to turn

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,119
it over

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,200
to brad topple with ibm also so

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,319
ibm we're grateful to have them involved

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,839
they've been

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,280
really big players very important

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,400
players in the open source community for

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,839
a long period of time

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,960
we've worked with them we know that

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,240
because we've worked with them for more

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,280
than a decade

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,559
i initially noticed their contributions

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,000
to watson

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,400
everybody here most people here have

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,079
heard of ibm watson we knew that a lot

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,520
of open source went into the building of

00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,680
the infrastructure and really building

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,280
that product and that platform out

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,480
and so we've been following them again

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,000
for more than a decade they've been

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,440
speaking at our conferences and they've

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,160
been partners with us for a very long

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,800
period of time

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,240
so it's great to have them back they

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,480
made several announcements at the

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,880
event last year in 2019. of course they

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,800
did that live from our stage

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,319
but this is virtual but hopefully in

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,319
2021 again

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,920
we will we will have them back live so

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,240
with all that said andu again

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,440
uh indo mha is joining us from africa so

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,119
into what i'm going to do

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,280
again just like i did with cedric i'm

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,200
going to cut my microphone

to combat

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,119
racial inequalities ibm is a founding

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,839
partner in call for code

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,960
the largest tech for good initiative of

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,280
its kind

anywhere in the world it's a successful

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,960
global program which for the past three

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,400
years has been addressing some of the

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,680
most pressing

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,680

00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,599
justice

00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,920
this encourages adoption incubation

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,640
evolution of open source projects to

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,040
drive progress in three important areas

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,640
first police and judicial reform and

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,680
accountability

00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,760
diverse representation policy and

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,559
legislation reform

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,960
today i'd like to announce that the call

00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,920

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,079
is contributing five solution starters

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,640
to the open source community

00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,280
really to galvanize to accelerate that

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,400
progress

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,200
towards a more inclusive equal equitable

00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,440
world

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,640
these five solutions cover topics

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,200
including voting

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,359
including incident response reporting

together with partners such as black

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,440
girls code

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,640
and collab capital call for code for

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,440
racial justice

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,079

appreciate that you know it's

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,680
interesting

00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,760
uh that's really exciting because as you

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,480
stated you did that last year right ibm

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,079
made that

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,599
presentation now last year it was a

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,839
little bit different as i stated it was

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,680
live on stage and of course if this were

00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,040
a normal year you would be doing the

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,079
check presentation you'd actually have

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,000
the large check

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,599
i really felt like that was cool the

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,119
vibe would be electric

00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,640
thousands and thousands of people would

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,599
be here now they're just online they're

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,599
still here

00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,640
but uh but but thank you very very much

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,160

news and again it's great to see your

00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,520
commitment to open source again ibm's

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,559
been doing it for a long time we know

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,599
that because we've worked with you for

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,799
more than a decade

00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,559
but it's still great to see you

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,000
continuing to do it and then to choose

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,680
to do it here at all things open so

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,599
we're extremely grateful for that

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,720

from fidelity investments again this is

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,160
another case

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,079
where um you know fidelity investments

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,920
has worked very closely with us

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,359
for a number of years now they've become

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,359
great partners with all things open

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,480
they're big supporters of the community

00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,240
um they have a large center here a large

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,520
center of operations in the research

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,480
triangle and

00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,839

that you've um yeah shut your camera and

00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,200
shut your microphone as well and i'm

from my home in the state of north

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,680
carolina although i'm sure we all would

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,760
love to be

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,520
in the convention center but this

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,520
opportunity taking it virtual

01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,079
allows many others who would not have

01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,720
been able to attend in person to join

01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,079
in with us before you think i've

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,640
stumbled into the wrong

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,359
zoom webinar i wanted to clarify that

01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,440
yes

01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,280
you heard that right i'm here from

01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,520
fidelity investments

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,559
you may be wondering what in the world a

01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,559
dni leader

01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,480
from a financial services company is

01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,799
doing amounts the inspiring

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,079
open source speakers you'll hear from

01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,119
this morning

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,640
and the first reason is this we are not

01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,319
just a finserv company we also like to

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,760
think of ourselves as a technology

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,119
company

01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,119
we spend billions annually on technology

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,640
that spend covers everything from

01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,119
customer platforms

01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,280
to tools that help us collaborate to

01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,760
building virtual reality experiences to

01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,960
help onboard new employees

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,559
firm wide 25 percent of our employees

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,200
work in technology

01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,160
and in north carolina home to all things

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,079
open

01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,520
60 percent of our employees are

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,720
technologists

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,799
you heard me right sixty percent of my

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,839
fellow colleagues in north carolina

01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,880
are not financial advisors not customer

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,000
service reps

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,680
but people like you who build technology

01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,280
we pride ourselves on having an

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,880
innovation culture built around

01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,599
continuous development

01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,079
and a growth mindset our employees

01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,079
participate in our blockchain club

01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,119
join our women in technology special

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,280
interest group

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,079
and get involved with fidelity labs our

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,000
incubation lab for new ideas

01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,319
we have a long history of investing in

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,720
the cutting edge with recent commitments

01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,640
around cryptocurrency and blockchain

01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,160
and exciting collaborations like our

01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,480
quantum computing efforts

01:01:52,160 --> 01:02:00,400
with aws fidelity is always creating

01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,440
in fact we hold 259 patents on a variety

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,440
of topics

01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,319
a great testament to our consistent

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,400
focus on innovation one

01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,480
area specifically around open

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,400
collaboration is our work to release

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,000
more of our machine learning efforts as

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,920
open source

01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,359
these have been focused on making common

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,680
algorithms available

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,440
and also for creating more simplified

01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,400
interfaces for frameworks like

01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,280
tensorflow

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,119
and pytorch you'll hear more about our

01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,520
open source approach and efforts

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,720
from my colleagues justin ratcliff and

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,799
sachin sulkin

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,799
in their respective sessions at all

01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:37,680
things open

01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,480
okay so now we know why fidelity is here

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,960
today

01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,799
but what does inclusion and diversity

01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,000
have to do with technology

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:48,640
and more specifically open source

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,480
everyone attending today's event is on

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,599
the hook for co-creating something

01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,839
innovative

01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,839
you sit on teams and manage projects

01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,799
that create tools and platforms

01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,079
that improve people's lives maybe even

01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,720
in ways they haven't

01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,319
asked for yet the connection between

01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,640
diversity and inclusion

01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,760
innovation and profitability has been

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,599
proven

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,440
here are a few data points to ground us

01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,920
all

01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,920
mckinsey's 2019 analysis found that

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,880
companies in the top quartile for gender

01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,559
diversity

01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,119
on executive teams were 25 more likely

01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,160
to have

01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:27,039
above average profitability and this

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,960
goes even further for ethnic diversity

01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,720
where companies in the top quartile of

01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,400
ethnic diversity outperform

01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,559
others by 36 percent and this holds true

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,119
for times of uncertainty like we're in

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:43,440
right now several reports showed that in

01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:45,200
2008's global financial crisis

01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,280
banks with a higher share of women on

01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,880
their boards were more stable than their

01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,559
peers

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,160
although we all know that diversity and

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,480
inclusion is important

01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,000
technology and other industries like

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,440
financial services

01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,599
remains largely white and male

01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,200
since june of this year there's been a

01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,880
larger spotlight on the importance of

01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,960
diversity and inclusion

01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,280
there's tremendous energy around these

01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,319
topics and how it applies in all that we

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,720
do

01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:15,119
people want to take action but often

01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,880
don't know where to start

01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,559
it's the same problem that has stalled

01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,280
this work for decades

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:25,440
sometimes it just feels too big to solve

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,440
at fidelity we approach diversity and

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,280
inclusion a little differently

01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,079
with a behaviors based approach that

01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,640
taps into the science of habit change

01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,640
we have a concept called simple starts

01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,480
which prompts our employees to make

01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,680
adjustments to the behaviors and

01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,799
business processes

01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,559
that make up their day-to-day work by

01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,079
focusing on behaviors within your

01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,319
immediate control

01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,920
rather than trying to shift an entire

01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,599
organization's culture

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:57,520
all at once we see incremental changes

01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,839
that add up significantly over time

01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,680
our concept may be called simple starts

01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:03,520
but there's nothing simple about the

01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,240
work of diversity and inclusion

01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,640
it's a complicated ingrained problem

01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,480
that can't be solved overnight

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,319
getting started though can be a lot

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,359
simpler with some of the ideas that i'll

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:17,119
share with you today

01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:20,079
i'm going to cover a few simple starts

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:23,039
in three distinct categories

01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,760
team management and dynamics everyday

01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,039
pivots

01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,880
and of course technology

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,880
since open source is all about coming

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,000
together on collaborative teams to

01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,839
create and build

01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,760
let's start with team dynamic team

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,920
management and dynamics

01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,960
here are a few simple behavioral changes

01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,960
you can implement on your teams today

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,559
rotate work assignments on your team

01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,480
regularly including

01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,760
team housework like note-taking or

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,559
meeting scheduling

01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,400
and higher profile projects versus only

01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,440
going to the well-known few

01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,599
members of your team set team members

01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,960
up with mentors or sponsors with

01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,480
different backgrounds

01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,559
to expand their view of the world

01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,440
encourage participation or development

01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:10,240
of employee resource groups or ergs

01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,000
at fidelity we have six ergs and four

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,520
special interest groups

01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,200
more than half of our employees

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,200
participate in at least one of these

01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
groups and some participate in three or

01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,640
more

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,680
consider starting affinity groups if

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,000
your organization does not yet have them

01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,079
these groups provide ready access to

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,640
diverse thoughts and perspectives

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,200
they can serve as focus groups talent

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,119
pools

01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:38,160
and or business partners in your work

01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,000
audit the membership of your team seek

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,839
participation and contribution from a

01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,240
diverse set of people

01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:46,880
and when an underrepresented person

01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,000
leaves your team dig into understanding

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,680
the why

01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,680
in case there are changes that need to

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,079
be made

01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,440
reconsider your team participation

01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,520
criteria

01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,599
balance the need for specific skills

01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:02,160
like coding which can be taught

01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,799
with the value of fresh perspectives

01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,680
which

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,599
might be impossible to teach at fidelity

01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,680
we have a few programs focused on

01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,799
non-traditional sources of talent

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,640
in technology fidelity made introduces

01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:17,119
associates from traditionally

01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,880
non-technical roles in the enterprise to

01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,760
apply their business experience to tech

01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,000
problems

01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,400
and we partner with reach hire to

01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,880
provide career paths for a diversity of

01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,160
life

01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,200
situations now

01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,200
let's talk about everyday pivots

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,359
these are changes that everyone can make

01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,680
regardless of their role on a team

01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:38,720
or in an organization to be more

01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,280
inclusive

01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,160
and they span across work life and home

01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,760
life

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,200
it's difficult to influence one without

01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,799
the other and what's the difference

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,839
especially these days

01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:52,400
you're here with me in my home

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,640
language matters so pay careful

01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,480
attention to the words you use

01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,480
use pronouns in your introductions to

01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,640
create safety for others to share how

01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,000
they identify

01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:06,240
use more inclusive terms for example

01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,680
stop using guys as a way to refer to

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,520
mixed groups of people

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,200
and look for something that might be a

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,520
little more gender neutral

01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,599
like folks we use that a lot here in the

01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,920
south of of us

01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,759
capitalize the b in black in your

01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,440
writing when referring to black people

01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,000
or communities

01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,120
for the open source community eliminate

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,640
terminology

01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,640
like whitelist blacklist or master slave

01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,199
and consider alternatives for other

01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,000
gendered language

01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:38,000
monitor your information diet this means

01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,880
paying careful attention that the books

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,759
you read podcasts you listen to and the

01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,679
shows you view

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,799
aren't all created by people with the

01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,040
same backgrounds or perspectives

01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,839
demand a seat at the table and bring

01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,120
someone new

01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:55,600
along with you where or when possible

01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,080
for the woman in the audience make sure

01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,480
you're representing the work you've done

01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,679
don't be shy or self-deprecating when

01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,480
sharing your accomplishments

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,120
overall exposing ourselves to new

01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,319
thoughts

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,040
ideas approaches and people makes us all

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,960
better

01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,679
and as a result we create better

01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:18,080
products and solutions

01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,600
and last but certainly not least

01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,040
technology

01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,279
the good news is that due to

01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,159
advancements developed by technologists

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,319
like you

01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:27,520
we the humans don't have to do this all

01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,440
on our own

01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,880
here are a few ways we can use tech to

01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,199
help us create more diverse and

01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,120
inclusive workplaces

01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:37,040
use artificial intelligence to audit the

01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,440
language and job descriptions

01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,600
at fidelity we run our jobs through a

01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,679
tool that scans for bias language

01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,520
it takes about six minutes per role but

01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,239
has greatly improved the number of

01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,120
female

01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:50,799
applicants we receive meet diverse

01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,719
people where they are

01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,239
implement processes that post all of

01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,400
your open jobs

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,440
to a variety of diverse online job

01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,159
boards

01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,280
remember that data isn't the end all and

01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:04,159
be all

01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,400
my friend and leading ai ethicist and ai

01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:07,920
activist renee cummings reminded us in a

01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:11,440
recent talk at fidelity

01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,280
that there's no such thing as raw data

01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,560
the data points we use to build

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,520
technology

01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,600
often comes with built-in bias because

01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,360
it originates from an environment where

01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,360
racism is systemic

01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,800
and stereotypes have been baked in for

01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,199
centuries

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,920
ensure you're evaluating all of the

01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,800
components

01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,120
into your technology solutions for bias

01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,080
and

01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,840
engage diverse stakeholders throughout

01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,960
you'll hear more from another of my

01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,600
colleagues

01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,560
melinda thalbar on our approach to ai

01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,280
bias and mitigation at fidelity

01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,199
invest in places to come together online

01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,239
of course the open source community has

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,800
been practicing

01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:53,199
true online collaboration for years for

01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,159
example at the linux foundation

01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,320
covet 19 has exemplified the importance

01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,800
of creating virtual spaces for people to

01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,280
gather

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,480
and share ideas ensure these online

01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:08,159
spaces are accessible and open to all

01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,480
using tools like live closed captioning

01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:12,400
as i shared those three categories

01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:15,040
doesn't it sound a lot like people

01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,320
processes and technology a framework

01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,159
many of you are already familiar with

01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,840
i hope that these simple starts i shared

01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,880
today can help you and your teams get

01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,880
started

01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,719
if you've already started perhaps i've

01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,080
given you a few new ways to continue the

01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,760
journey

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,840
it can be easy to let the problem

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,560
paralyze you that analysis

01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,400
paralysis we all know our country's

01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,760
diversity and inclusion challenges may

01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,280
feel too big to solve

01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,719
if you zoom out so focus on zooming in

01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,080
and get started zoom in and shift from

01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,400
trying to change the world

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,159
or your company to changing three to

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,760
four behaviors on the teams where you

01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:53,440
contribute

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,080
progress against diversity and inclusion

01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,719
is a lot like open source in that way

01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,360
most of us will not unveil a shiny new

01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,440
product or solution to the problem

01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,800
this is something we will all build

01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,600
together

01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,600
right out in the open bringing the best

01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,440
of ourselves to contribute

01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,320
and the first few attempts might not be

01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:17,040
perfect but with some iteration

01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,080
we can create transparent solutions that

01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,280
amount to real

01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,920
change thank you all for the time

01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,040
and enjoy the rest of this year's all

01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,080
things open

01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,840

track it's a great topic uh it's

01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,480

01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,840
uh ai and machine learning so again the

01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,880
topic is great but she is going to be

01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,960
speaking tomorrow

01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,400
and that i'll use that as an opportunity

two-day event so by all means please try

01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:13,120
to attend both days

01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,400
so all that being said so remember we

01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,480
started this morning we went

01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,000
to erica brescia in silicon valley san

01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,199
francisco area on the west coast of the

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,840
u.s

01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,360
and then we moved to shedrick akantayo

01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,199
that joined us from africa and then we

01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,199
went to indo we stayed in africa

01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,960
and then we came back to brad topple who

01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,280
was in the research triangle park and we

01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,760
just

01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,600
switched over to transition to wendy who

01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,520
is also in the triangle park

01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,120
the research triangle park the rtp area

01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,440
of north carolina and now we're going to

01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,320
go

01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,960
to a speaker that is located on the west

01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,600
coast of the united states matt acey

01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,600
who serves as open source head of open

source strategy and marketing at again

01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,480
amazon web services

01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:56,000
um i've known matt for uh a while

01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,600

01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,480
right he's a noted author

01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,320
well-known uh published widely in

01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,920
infoworld and techrepublic

01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,520
have a lot of respect for him everything

01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,040
i've ever read has been very good

01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,400
and i would say that about matt even if

01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,760
he weren't on this call and joining us

01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,960
today i tell everybody

01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,679
hey you know you want to be more

01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,080
educated on open source by all mean

01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,679
by all means re read maths work so i

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,960
have been literally for years and years

01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,280
and years so it's a pleasure to have him

01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,640
here

01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,640
he's been a speaker at all things open

01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,080
before uh he's always done a wonderful

01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,880
job and he's just a really nice human

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,040
being so

01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
with that i'm going to yield it over to

01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,760
uh to to

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,760
matt i will say this we're running ahead

01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,120
just just a bit this is unusual so we're

01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,760
running about five minutes ahead of

01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,080
schedule

01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,120
so matt just so you know you're you're

01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,360
actually we're about 10

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,400
10 minutes ahead of schedule sorry i

01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,920
need to correct myself

01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,080
so if you need a few more minutes on

01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
your talk by all means please feel free

01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,520
to take it we're scheduled to wrap up

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,280
the keynote block at 10 45.

01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,560
it's about 10 20 right now so you do

01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,159
have a few extra minutes

01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,000
so if you run over please don't worry

01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,679
about that at all i would also say this

01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,679
if you're attending

01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,840
all of our past speakers those that

01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,239
spoke early are staying around

01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,840
and we are asking them to sort of focus

01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,360
on the q a feature so if you have a

01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,280
question for them or a comment

01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,360
pose those in the q a feature you can do

01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,440
so in chat but remember that there's a

01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,440
lot going on in chat the messaging sort

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,880
of stacks on top of

01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,880
you know the one that was posted

01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,320
previously so things have a tendency to

01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,120
get lost so please focus on

01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,600
q a and we're asking erica and endu and

01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,400
brad

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,520
and and shedrick to and now wendy to

01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,800
kind of focus on q

01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,640
a so again all means we want to

01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,480
encourage dialogue and interaction

01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,000
but just you know try to try to do it in

01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,440
the right way so to speak

01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,679
so with all that said i'm going to yield

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,239
this to matt who's joining us live from

01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,480
utah

01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,600
i believe if i'm not mistaken uh and

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,880
what i'm going to do matt i'll do

01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,400
exactly the same thing that i've done

01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,840
before i'm going to turn my microphone

01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,360
off and stop my video

01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,040
and you will begin to share yours and

01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,520
then you'll share your screen so with

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,679
that

01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,800
i yield the virtual stage to you my

01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,280
friend

01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,880
awesome thank you todd and this will

01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,560
take me a second good thing that we have

01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,560
a few extra minutes because

01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,480
uh as with any meeting in technology it

01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,000
should always start with some technical

01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:08,320
difficulties

01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,840
so to start with let's say

01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,840
let me share my screen

01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:21,840
ah there we go

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:31,280
and let's go

01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,560
so i'm first of all very grateful for

01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,880
todd i have

01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,840
i think it might have been 2007 was my

01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,360
first year

01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:42,719
presenting at what was then called uh

01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,280
poscon and has since become all things

01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,280
open

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,120
todd has been very gracious in the past

01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,520
of asking for my

01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,199
uh my opinion on things as to what he

01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,000
should do to make this event even better

01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,120
and

01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,199
um fortunately he has not heeded any of

01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,600
my suggestions which is why all things

01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,600
open

01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,560
is as fantastic as it is today and he's

01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,960
just done an amazing job

01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,199
i want to talk a little bit and

01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,440
appreciate todd and the

01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,280
other speakers that we've had so far i

01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:14,159
want to talk a little bit about

01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,480
open source in the cloud which has been

01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:18,640
a

01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:20,480
contentious issue in the in the past

01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,000
but in the spirit of the people who have

01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,480
already spoken i don't want to talk

01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
about it from a contentious angle

01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,000
i want to talk about it in the spirit of

01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,280
partnership

01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,800
but i am going to start with something

01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,520
that might sound a little contentious

01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,520
and that is

01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,840
in a conversation that i had not too

01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,120
long ago with a colleague of mine matt

01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,280
wilson

01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,800
he made the observation that most

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,080
enterprise software

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,719
is garbage he might not have used the

01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,960
word garbage but he said

01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,440
we talked about why enterprise software

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,719
is so incredibly bad

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,360
and his suggestion was that the reason

01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,600
for that

01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,840
ultimately comes down to the fact that

01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,560
the vendors of the software are not the

01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:05,280
ultimate users of the software

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,960
and the closer we could get and this

01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,800
goes back to something that

01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:13,280
now ibm president then red hat ceo

01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,080
jim whitehurst said back in 2009 which

01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,880
was

01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,320
we have so much waste in in the software

01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,120
industry

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,679
we really need end users there's not a

01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,760
great

01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,880
word for that but let's say end users or

01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,640
customers

01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,280
also not a great way of expressing it

01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:32,400
but end users of software we need more

01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,840
end users of software contributing to

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,679
open source so that instead of

01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,159
reinventing the wheel

01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,040
we can collaborate that's what i want to

01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,199
talk about today

01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,480
i want to talk about how we get there

01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:47,920
and how we bring down the wall between

01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,600
open source and cloud because there's

01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,199
been this myth that's surfaced over the

01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,480
last few years and that is that

01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:57,760
in some way cloud and open source

01:18:54,480 --> 01:19:01,360
are in contention are in conflict

01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:04,640
and i would argue the opposite is true

01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:07,520
recently in a new stack series

01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,880
that that i wrote and i got so much

01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,520
great feedback from people

01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,480
on twitter and and quote unquote in real

01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,760
life

01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,480
um that said the cloud would not be

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,719
possible

01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,920
without open source and i think that's

01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,040
true i think it might have been

01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,480
erica who started this day off who said

01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,239
it really i mean

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,280
part of it comes down to economics but

01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:31,440
it's not really a matter of economics

01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,120
it's really a matter of how how would

01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,360
you count up all the licenses

01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,159
if you're thinking of thousands or tens

01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,960
of thousands

01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,600
or millions of servers how do you do

01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,960
that

01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,360
with open source you don't really have

01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,840
to think about that with traditional

01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,040
enterprise software proprietary software

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,080
you did

01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:52,159
and it makes it such that the cloud

01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,159
would be if not impossible and i would

01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,920
argue impossible

01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,199
at least extraordinarily difficult and

01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,239
chris devona who i think is

01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:01,760
speaking tomorrow made that contention

01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,679
years ago that google would not be

01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,960
possible without open source

01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:09,679
so we know that the cloud enables or

01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,600
that open source enables the cloud but i

01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,719
want to talk a little bit about how

01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:18,560
the cloud is enabling open source

01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,920
so and and as part of that a good friend

01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,239
of mine sam ramji

01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,360
who's now chief strategy officer at data

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,600
stacks

01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,280
used to be the open source guy back when

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,960
that was a thing at microsoft but that

01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,400
was a long time ago

01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:35,520
now open source is uh everybody's thing

01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,639
at microsoft um sam's

01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,400
likes to say if you want to go fast go

01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,080
alone

01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,480
but if you want to go far go together

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,760
it's not his saying but he says it a lot

01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,920
so i want to talk about that and i'm

01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,880
also going to talk about pie in part

01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,280
because

01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,080
at that first poscon all things open

01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,719
that i spoke at

01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,600
todd uh taught fedesal because that

01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,400
todd's like that

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,840
it's at southern hospitality but also

01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,960
because i like to bake pie so we're

01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,960
going to talk a little bit about pie

01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,960
when you think of the biggest

01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:11,199
contributors to open source

01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,880
i'd be interested and we can't take a a

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,080
poll here and ask everybody but i'd be

01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,679
interested who you think

01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,840
of when you when you think of that when

01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:20,080
i say the biggest contributor that you

01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,360
can think of to open source

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,360
put it keep it in your mind

01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,760
i'm pretty sure you're thinking of a

01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,719
cloud vendor right now and if you are

01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,400
you

01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:32,400
if you're playing your odds of the top

01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:35,520
10 uh

01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,560
open source contributors seven of those

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,280
top ten

01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,920
are cloud vendors and i use the term

01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,639
cloud

01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,400
um a little bit loosely i shouldn't say

01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,800
vendors i should say cloud companies

01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,600
because

01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,400
in that number is facebook for example

01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,600
in that

01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:54,400
in that group is amazon

01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,199
in that group is google microsoft red

01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,320
hat slash

01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:59,760
ibm but also other companies

01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,159
there are a few other companies that

01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,480
don't fit that cloud label like

01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,080
intel for example but intel does a fair

01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,440
amount to enable the cloud with

01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,080
with chips and other saw in software

01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,000
but think about that why would that be

01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,760
that the vast majority

01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,600
if you if you tally up the biggest

01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,719
contributors in terms of

01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,520
raw contributors to open source why

01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:26,159
would they be cloud companies

01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,199
and i think it's i think it if you if

01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:29,199
you step back for

01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,120
for a second it's a little bit obvious

01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,840
why that would be the case

01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,560
it's because cloud companies don't

01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,840
really

01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,600
have anything to lose by contributing

01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,800
software they don't sell software

01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,960
facebook doesn't sell software aws or

01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,760
amazon doesn't sell software

01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,760
we sell services so the software itself

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,480
can be given away and if we look again

01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,320
at the

01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,920
at the things that have come out of the

01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,000
different cloud companies

01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,600
amazing software like kubernetes that

01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,920
came out of google

01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,040
um this is the sort of thing that the

01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,480
cloud enables

01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:08,080
because it takes away the competitive uh

01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:12,400
need to keep software proprietary

01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,400
so if you

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,400
if you run some sort of calculus as to

01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,600
contributes equals to benefits well it

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,920
also makes sense

01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,679
that the cloud companies would be big

01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,679
contributors

01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,520
because we're benefiting a great deal

01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,960
from open source and i want to talk

01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,920
about that

01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,280
but really i want to get away a bit from

01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,320
talking

01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,840
about the big companies behind open

01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,880
source

01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,760
and i want to talk about the people

01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,360
behind open source and how people are

01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,880
making software

01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:50,400
open source software better in the cloud

01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,159
and the first person i want to talk to

01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,719
about is dress spider

01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,360
a friend of mine who uh much more

01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,239
importantly

01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:00,400
well much more importantly to you as to

01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:04,000
why he's important he's

01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:07,199
the founder of drupal but that's not how

01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,960
dries started when he started drupal he

01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,000
didn't start drupal he was looking for a

01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,360
way to share

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,280
a quote-unquote high-speed adsl

01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,639
internet connection as a student in

01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,679
belgium

01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,120
and he and his friends

01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,880
were just looking for to build a

01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,960
bulletin board well that little bulletin

01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,600
board evolved into drupal which

01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,400
last year or for the last major release

01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,320
had 10

01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,480
000 different contributors to the

01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:36,560
project it's an amazing example

01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:39,760
of open source success but getting from

01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,639
dries and his friends to

01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,600
dries and ten thousand of his friends

01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,679
and by the way

01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,800
dries so he started a company called

01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,679
aquia

01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,360
and aquia despite being the largest

01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,639
single contributor to

01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,159
to drupal accounted for less than five

01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,440
percent of those total

01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:01,040
contributions to the last release so how

01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:04,080
did he get from

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:07,199
one person to ten thousand

01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,880
well along the way in 2000 um dries in a

01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,960
conversation that i had with him he said

01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,960
in 2000 it was a they were really

01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,719
struggling to scale

01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,960
drupal and part of that was mysql

01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,080
mysql is a great open source database

01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,000
but he was struggling

01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,239
with all that as he said the hundreds of

01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,320
knobs that he had to fiddle with

01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:31,199
to get it to scale circa 2006

01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,320
aws launches and suddenly that he's in

01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,239
his words

01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,360
that became dramatically easier and he

01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,400
says you have no

01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:40,400
idea the change that it made for drupal

01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,719
in enabling them to scale it

01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,320
so the one hand thinking about cloud one

01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,280
thing that cloud does

01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,880
is that it makes it so that individual

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,239
open source entrepreneurs an

01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,840
entrepreneur i don't mean that they

01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:54,159
necessarily start a business i just mean

01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,800
that they start a project

01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,600
an open source entrepreneur finds it

01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,960
dramatically

01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:04,000
easier to start and scale their project

01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,199
it's one thing that the cloud does

01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,159
another example a more recent example is

01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:11,760
matt klein

01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:13,920
with envoy envoy is this fantastic open

01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,679
source project that matt started

01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:20,000
as uh as an engineer at lyft

01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,880
in matt's words when he when he uh

01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,520
started the

01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,920
envoy it started off just as an initial

01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,760
in

01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,360
an internal project they were trying to

01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,000
move from

01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:32,080
a monolithic uh a monolith based

01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
architecture to a microservices-based

01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:38,159
architecture and so

01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:42,960
they he and and his team created envoy

01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:44,639
great but then they decided

01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,480
well maybe we should open source this

01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,320
and in matt's words

01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,320
he did this in part because he thought

01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,520
it'd be good for his career lyft

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,520
did it in part because they thought it'd

01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,840
be great for recruiting

01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,760
but it was an example of an of an

01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:01,199
individual

01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,880
uh person uh matt deciding that he

01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,320
wanted to open source this thing and

01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,600
then taking it out now

01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,760
it's become this great service mesh that

01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,800
uh a lot of different people use but it

01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,400
started as

01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:16,320
him scratching an itch for lyft and it

01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,480
in thinking about it in terms of we're

01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,800
seeing again coming back to that idea of

01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,560
the best software will emerge from those

01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,560
who use the software

01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,480
in dries's case it was dries starting it

01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,480
to to share

01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,560
internet access at a university in

01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:33,199
belgium in matt's case

01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,239
it was him sharing the software that

01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:37,600
would enable

01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:38,480
um lyft to get a higher return on their

01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,280
investment and

01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,800
envoy uh but they built it to support

01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,480
cloud native applications

01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,480
at at uh lyft

01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,040
incidentally i asked matt recently

01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,760
why don't we see more user driven open

01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,960
source and user driven open source

01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,120
and i try not to swear so i won't quote

01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:04,239
him verbatim but he said

01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:06,800
it's because it's so effing hard

01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:07,840
and he said but for my naivete i never

01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,840
would have done this

01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,120
but we're grateful that he did and now

01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,880
today

01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,880
he's we have this great open source

01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,880
project and by the way

01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,960
um if you look at the contributors to it

01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,000
at least forty percent roughly forty

01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,080
percent of that

01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,679
code to contributed to envoys coming

01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,159
from google

01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,040
and so we see the cloud contributing

01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:31,760
back

01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:33,679
to uh to what it's created i want to go

01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,239
to one more example

01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:38,480
and this is a madeleine olsen and it's

01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:39,840
the story of redis but that story starts

01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,000
not with madeleine it starts with

01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:46,320
salvatore san felipo he was the founder

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,960
of of redis and what salvatore started

01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,440
uh read us he did it this also has

01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,800
another

01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,719
mysql angle he did it not because

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,239
he really wanted to start to build a new

01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,280
database he had no experience with

01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:59,040
database he says

01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,800
i had no idea what i was getting into i

01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:04,000
broke all the rules

01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,320
on on database design uh

01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,040
no one really would take an in-memory

01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,440
database

01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,080
seriously at the time but he did it

01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,920
anyway

01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,120
and he started it one thing that it

01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,800
didn't have

01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,400
was encryption built in so madeline is

01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,280
an engineer on the elastic

01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,920
team at at aws and i think roughly two

01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,840
years ago

01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,360
she and her manager decided hey you know

01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,159
what we

01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:31,199
depend in significant part on redis we

01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:31,199
should contribute back

01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,400
well you don't just walk into mordor and

01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,159
you don't just walk into an open source

01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,760
project and take over as

01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:41,520
take over that project so madeline

01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,159
started small and in her words

01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,760
she continued to be a relatively small

01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:47,760
contributor she did things like

01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,520
enable greater communication by starting

01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,320
a slack channel

01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,760
for redis contributors she did other

01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,320
things like

01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,880
preparing other people's contributions

01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,920
to make

01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,199
help them pass muster with salvatore and

01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,000
she did one thing

01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:06,159
that she didn't get actually her code

01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,760
accepted by salvatore

01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:10,400
but she came up with the idea of how to

01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,920
get encryption built into redis

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,480
and yasi got the one of the contributors

01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,400
and

01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,320
salvatore reviewed it said decided that

01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,639
they didn't want to take that

01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,840
her code but liked the approach and so

01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,600
they

01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,840
used that approach and built their own

01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,880
code but it was little contributions

01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,440
like that

01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,760
that earned her goodwill with the team

01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,080
and then recently when redis decided or

01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,280
the

01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:38,239
the redis uh salvatore decided to leave

01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,679
redis to go pursue other things they

01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,280
came up with a new governance structure

01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:42,719
and madeleine was asked to be one of the

01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,120
five maintainers

01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,840
along with uh three folks from redis

01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:49,679
labs and zouzou from

01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,719
alibaba it's a great story

01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,159
of how an individual

01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,760
working in a cloud company because it

01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:58,000
was solving a

01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,600
particular cloud companies or scratching

01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,520
our itch

01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,360
how she went from a small contributor to

01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,880
now a significant maintainer

01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:10,000
but i think it also says a great deal

01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,920
about how open source can work in the

01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,880
cloud so here you start with salvatore

01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,440
who by the way

01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,360
i wish i looked like salvatore these

01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:22,080
rugged good looks kind of looks like

01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:25,679
michael hutchins the former

01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:27,040
vote lead vocalist for nxs salvatore if

01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,760
you're listening

01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,080
man crush on you the but you look at

01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,360
what

01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:36,880
it went from salvatore touretta's labs

01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:41,040
starting um to help fund the development

01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:43,520
of of redis to where we are today

01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,120
with redis labs continuing to to fund a

01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,480
significant amount of the development

01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:49,360
around redis

01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,159
but also a number of cloud vendors

01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,120
building

01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:55,040
managed redis services around redis it's

01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,440
a fantastic example and you say

01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,639
well surely this is cratered redis labs

01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:01,360
revenue

01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:03,280
i don't i'm not privy to their to their

01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,719
numbers and i wouldn't divulge them if i

01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,239
were

01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,400
but in my conversations with them and

01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:10,000
they're a great partner of of aws

01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,400
they're doing really really well it

01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,000
turns out that sharing

01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:19,520
code and sharing and growing a pie

01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,080
is a good strategy so let's talk about

01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,560
pie

01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,719
because like i said i really like pie

01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,199
and bake a lot of pie

01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,480
let's do some pie related math so

01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:32,239
gartner said

01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:35,040
that in 2020

01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:35,840
even with coven global i.t spending

01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,840
should top

01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,360
about 3.9 trillion dollars a lot of

01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,040
money cloud and we spend a lot of time

01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,840
talking about cloud and like figuring

01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:48,960
out who's winning in the cloud wars

01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:52,239
well it's a relatively small piece of

01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,560
that overall pie 266 billion

01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,239
it's it's significant money but in the

01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,440
grand scheme of things

01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:59,440
it's a really small pie

01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:05,120
i was an english major and so i'm not

01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,639
necessarily great at math but i think

01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:10,159
what that means

01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:13,199
is that when we spend time

01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:15,360
agonizing and fighting over who's

01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:18,719
winning in the cloud and who's

01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:20,800
uh is cloud chewing into open source etc

01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,000
we're talking we're fighting over six

01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,440
percent of that global

01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,679
i.t spend

01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,199
which is a little ridiculous now we

01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,040
could say

01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:32,639
that well you know we've been

01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:36,400
conditioned to think about

01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:37,600
um in this way of we're conditioned to

01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,600
think about small pie

01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,840
martin mikos is a good friend and about

01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,400
15 years ago when he was ceo of mysql

01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:47,679
he's now ceo of hacker one

01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:51,040
but he went he was ceo of mysql and

01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:54,000
he came up with this great quote saying

01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,719
for in open source he wanted to take a

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,320
big market

01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,080
make it smaller and then take a big

01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:02,159
chunk of that market

01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:05,199
and we're kind of used to thinking about

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:06,719
um when we talk about open source that

01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:08,400
like saving money

01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,320
and we're we talk about cloud we talk

01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,320
about in the same way

01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,639
and so we end up with this little small

01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,239
pie it's a cute pie that's my um

01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:19,040
strawberries and cream pie that i like

01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:19,760
to make but it's a small pie and i like

01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,679
pie

01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,480
so i don't really want small pie so i

01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:27,360
had this conversation with simon wardley

01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:28,239
many of you have uh know simon and and i

01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,000
think he's

01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,679
i'm sure he's spoken here before in fact

01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,400
i think i've heard him speak at

01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,280
all things open before he introduced me

01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,320
to this idea

01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:41,520
of jevon's paradox and

01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:44,320
in a nutshell that idea is

01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,920
we normally think that when we save

01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,639
money when unit costs go

01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,239
down that the overall pie is going to

01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:50,800
shrink that the market will shrink

01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,400
because people

01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,239
spend less money because they'll pocket

01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:56,000
those savings and move on

01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:57,679
turns out that's not how things work in

01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,040
real life

01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:03,760
when we save money on

01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,719
on our cloud spent because of our cloud

01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,719
spend

01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:10,560
we spend we end up spending more when we

01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:12,480
save more by moving to postgres

01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,000
we end up spending more on databases or

01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:17,119
on or on other services

01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,600
around it so

01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:21,280
the way that i read that is that instead

01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:25,679
of

01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:27,520
instead of the lower unit costs

01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,880
that cloud and open source together

01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,560
bring us instead of

01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,679
that turning into less pi it turns into

01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,520
more

01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,040
the pi isn't shrinking it's getting

01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,920
bigger

01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,760
and by the way that applies to to the

01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:46,239
open source companies

01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:48,719
i saw just last week that databricks

01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:50,000
they i think i think they actually

01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,560
announced this that

01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,159
they are now on a 350 million dollar run

01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,679
rate

01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:58,719
selling managed spark and other open

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,560
source software

01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,080
well guess what databricks has healthy

01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,360
competition

01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:08,800
from from my company and from others

01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:11,600
and they're doing great in part because

01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,040
a variety of contributors are growing

01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,000
that pie

01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,480
look at mongodb doing phenomenally well

01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,119
i think

01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,600
roughly 500 million in revenue now

01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:21,199
almost

01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,719
half of which getting close to half of

01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,840
which comes from their cloud service

01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,880
atlas

01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,280
which is fantastic and you go down the

01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,639
list

01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:33,920
confluent recently well last year

01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:37,520
raised money on a huge valuation doing

01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,760
really really well in terms of revenue

01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,119
elastic same thing redis labs data

01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,960
stacks

01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,040
hashicorp all these open source

01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,520
companies doing really well

01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,840
and i would argue they're doing really

01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,119
well precisely because they've embraced

01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,119
cloud

01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,800
and early on we had some friction

01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:57,840
because

01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,520
over licensing gymnastics but i think

01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,320
that was just a moment in time

01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,600
i think it was just it it gave us time

01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,000
until we got to the point

01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,679
where we realized the cloud is not

01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,719
competitive to open source

01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,840
it's an enabler for open source it makes

01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:14,960
it so that

01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,840
end users can focus more time on getting

01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,480
work done

01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,600
rather than on doing the

01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:20,000
undifferentiated heavy lifting of

01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,199
setting

01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,239
up and managing infrastructure it's a

01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:29,199
really good thing

01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:31,119
what we have now i want to end with

01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:33,520
somebody who i think is extraordinarily

01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:36,880
smart adam jacob he was the

01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,960
co-founder and cto at chef and

01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,239
uh and now the co-founder of system

01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,480
initiative

01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,920
and he talks about cloud and open source

01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,040
in this way

01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,000
he says you can think of it as

01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:51,040
competitive or you can think of it

01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,840
as a way of growing that overall

01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,320
um the top of funnel or again in my

01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,840
words

01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,360
uh growing the pie

01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,280
and i remember having this conversation

01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,880
with a friend that i had worked with

01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:06,400
when i was at mongodb

01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,119
and we were at re invent aws re invent

01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,480
back when we were able to go and talk to

01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:14,080
people in person

01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:17,360
and it just struck me at that time that

01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:19,440
we those two companies but in general

01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:21,679
we are wasting a lot of time fighting

01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:24,400
over relatively small

01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,119
pieces of pie and that it would be much

01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,679
better

01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:30,639
for each of us to go out and build that

01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:33,920
pie contribute to that upstream

01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:36,239
open source project and we've seen that

01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,280
at my company we've seen that with most

01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:39,679
recently with

01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,719
radiss but also graphql and a number of

01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:42,239
other projects

01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,000
and if you look across those cloud

01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:47,280
companies people

01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,600
are doing i think a pretty good job

01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,000
of doing that we've had to figure it out

01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,800
over time but my sense

01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,320
is that there's this great opportunity

01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,440
for all of us

01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:02,080
to build these open source pies

01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,040
open source communities together we need

01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:05,119
to be a little bit

01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,600
patient with each other there's it's

01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:08,560
easy to make accusations and assume that

01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,639
we know

01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,639
what other people are thinking we assume

01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,199
we know why they do the things that

01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,800
that they do whether on an individual

01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:19,920
level or on a

01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:22,239
macro level on a company level

01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,600
i just ask that we be a little bit more

01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:26,400
thoughtful of each other and

01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,840
we remember open source is ultimately

01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,400
about community

01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:33,199
it's ultimately about people it's

01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:36,880
ultimately about enabling those people

01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:40,000
and as we do that we do something that

01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,840
makes me really happy and that is we

01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
grow the open source pie

01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,080
thank you very much and todd again thank

01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,239
you for having me i really appreciate it

01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:50,159
thank you very very much great job as

01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:51,760
always we wanted to uh again we're

01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:54,239
really happy and thankful for you to

01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,600
present that topic it's one that's it's

01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,360
influencing everyone you know it's

01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,480
having a big impact and as i said when

01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:00,880
we first got this

01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,560
block started in our keynotes we try to

01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,400
feature speakers and topics that are

01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,320
widely impactful that are

01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,119
again having an influence on people and

01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:11,199
on open source in general so that topic

01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:12,719
is certainly having an impact

01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:14,320
and again we very much wanted your

01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,920
perspective on that and to deliver the

01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,960
topic and make that available as part of

01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,000
the block so

01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,159
thank you very much and thanks for

01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,600
getting up early too i know i think

01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:23,440
i think both of our speakers from the

01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,480
west coast i know you got up early to

01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,080
join us today

01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,679
so again we don't take that for granted

01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,199
it's monday morning

01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:30,800
uh and i know schedules have changed

01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:32,400
with everyone going virtual

01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,080
and working from home and things like

01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,600
that but at the end of the day

01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,040
the facts remain the same you've gotten

01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,320
up early to join us so we very much

01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,320
appreciate that matt again

01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,760
great job and thank you for doing that

01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,440
so we're running about

01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,040
just a couple minutes ahead so what i'm

01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,960
going to do is take these uh

01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,280
two minutes just to run over some

01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,920
announcements again before we break and

01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,480
officially end the keynote block and day

01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,560
one

01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,840
keynote segment so i want to thank all

01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,080
of our keynote speakers

01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,760
they did a wonderful job they were

01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,920
strategically chosen

01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,360
based on the topic and who they were and

01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,639
their perspective from which they were

01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,320
delivering the topics

01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,560
i think everyone did an amazing job and

01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:10,239
again they were gracious enough to join

01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,199
us from all over the world

01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:14,960
live again erica joined us and i think

01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,199
she's still active in chat and she's

01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,639
responding to comments into questions

01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,239
and thank you very much for doing that

01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,000
so github obviously an integral player

01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:23,520
in the open source space can't be much

01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,239
more integral than github

01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,880
so as ceo you play a very prominent role

01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,320
and

01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,000
again you have a lot of influence so the

01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,679
fact that you took the time to join us

01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,360
we very much appreciate that shedrick

01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:36,000
thank you very much for joining us from

01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,679
from africa again open source in africa

01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,760
is a fascinating topic and we're

01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,280
we're excited to watch it grow and we're

01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,840
excited to watch it evolve and where it

01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,239
goes

01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,840
into the future ibm thank you again uh

and again uh it's been exciting to watch

01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,800
in uh ibm's contributions grow over time

01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,560
they've been doing it for a long time

01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,159
we're just glad that they're finally

01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,760
uh in our opinion letting the public

01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,639
know about what they've been doing for a

01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,400
long time

01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:02,000
and again we've worked together for more

01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,280
than a decade so i greatly appreciate

01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,679

want to thank our sponsors uh without

possible

01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,639
i do want to encourage you everyone's

01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,920
to talk to live human beings

01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,080
and i would encourage you to navigate

01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,920
over and you know learn more about them

01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,520

01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:02,960
making great contributions

01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:04,639
and the fact that they've supported this

01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,080
event by extension they're supporting

01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,440
the open source community so we could

01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,800

i know we have a lot of people joining

01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:30,320
us from different time zones so that

01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,000
would be a different time for you but

01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,159
here in about 15 minutes is when our

01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,760
first breakout session block will begin

01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:37,920
so keep that in mind take a look at the

01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,760

01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,119
schedule

01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,560
and see what you might want to attend

01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:56,080
chances are you already know what

01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,000
what session you're going to and what

01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,440
track it's on you've probably already

01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,159
taken a look at that but if you haven't

01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,000
please do that

01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:03,440
the leaderboard just a quick reminder is

01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,400
that you are accumulating points while

01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,239
you're on the site

01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,760
based on your activity this is something

01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,159
fun we tried to do we've never done this

01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,000
before

01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,760
frankly we've never been able to the

01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,600
virtual environment enables us to do

01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,520
this so we wanted to do something fun

01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,800
and uh maybe you know gamify this a

01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,080
little bit we're giving away some

01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,280
amazing prizes

01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,119
and what we're going to do just so you

01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,880
know and i know i mentioned this before

01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,800
is that um we're gonna do day one and

01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,400
day two so at the end of day one at the

close of business today once we wrap up

01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,520
content we're gonna refresh or reset the

01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,360

i'll end with this uh i am in you can

01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,920
see behind me we wanted to

01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,360
replicate uh the environment you know

01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,880
the real life environment what we would

01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,600
otherwise be doing if it weren't for

01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,600
covid

01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,800
as much as we can we chose to go live

01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,639
with our programming

01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,639
that was a risk right live programming

01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:04,560
is always a challenge and always a risk

01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,080
but we thought you were worth it you're

01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,800
worth the investment and you're worth

01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,760
the risk

01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:11,199
we wanted to in some small way return

01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,280
some sense of normalcy

01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:14,480
to life i know that life for everyone

01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,600
has been changed

01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:19,280
forever probably but i know i certainly

01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,360
long for kind of the normal

01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,800
and what what used to be so we tried to

01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,920
replicate that for you hopefully you've

01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,320
enjoyed it

01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:28,239
i wish how i wish this had three to four

01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:30,320
thousand people in it live right now

01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:31,440
and i was speaking to you live i will

01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,840
say this we're going to make every

01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,280
effort to come back live in 2021

01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,199
we've already saved our dates we'll

01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,520
release those right after this event

01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:40,880
so again we're we're going to make every

01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,520
effort to return to normal and be in

01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,360
person

01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:45,119
