so thanks everyone

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,639
so again just a little bit about me

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
again my name is kathy payne i'm

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,240
director of human resources here at

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,119
gravitational

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
and i joined gravitational december 2019

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,760
so it's coming up on

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
it's almost a year which is really

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
exciting and um

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,519
you know shortly after i joined this

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
director of human resources then the

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,920
world fell into this global pandemic

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
and kind of life changed we everyone

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960
immediately

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
um went to working from home and shelter

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
in place so it's been a really

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,760
interesting and exciting time

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
and as a director of human resources

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
really um

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
forced me to to look very carefully one

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,280
at our our systems

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
um both for emergencies for working from

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
home

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
being able to be flexible and transition

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,239
very quickly

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
as well as how we support um our

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,920
employees

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
from not just a physical health but

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,120
mental health perspective as well

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,559
i love dance i love yoga my background

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
before director being

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,280
before human resources was in education

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
um and i had a dance and yoga studio for

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,000
a long time

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
so i think that as a director of human

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
resources i really take that in terms of

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
how do you create spaces where people

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
can learn and grow

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,560
um because whether it's a middle school

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,920
classroom

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
or a dance class a ballet class um or a

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
work environment

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,920
people need to know and feel safe to

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,119
learn to grow to be listened to

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,840
to have a level of security

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,000
and so so that folks can thrive in their

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,200
roles so i take that very very seriously

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
that really it's how do how do we

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
and how does this department how do i um

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
really be a resource for the humans at

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
our company that's really important

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,200
so just a little bit about us so one

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,159
gravitational we build open core cloud

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
security

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
and infrastructure tools using golang

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
typescript and coffee

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
now please remember that i am not the

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,439
technical person at gravitational so i'm

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
like i'm this is the part where i'm

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,599
reading okay so

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
don't ask me too many questions about

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
that but definitely follow up with me

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
and

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,080
i'm happy to put you in touch with the

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
folks that can really talk to you

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
with like the utmost um excitement

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,680
enthusiasm

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,800
knowledge and brilliance around these

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,160
particular things so

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,360
well and i think coffee both

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,519
coffee both coffee and coffee script are

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
very very important to gravitational um

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
before we sheltered in place like

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,040
our coffee game both in our seattle

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,599
offices and our open offices

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,239
were were top notch so that's really

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,239
important to us

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
so our mission is to empower engineers

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
to just

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,840
to access and distribute resources

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
anywhere like we're all about freedom of

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,720
movement so that's

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
really important so if that is something

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
that you're interested in we're very

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,879
much

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
engineer centered so that's the comment

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
that we get

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,800
the most um about our company

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,319
when when people talk to us they know

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
that um

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
everything really centers around around

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
our engineers and

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,519
and the the culture really derives from

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
um from

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,360
our engineering department and we'll

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
talk about that a little bit later as

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
well

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,879
so we're a pioneer in environment free

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,599
computing and our commitment is really

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,760
to deliver

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,440
best-in-class security and compliance

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
and in everything that we make

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
so when it comes to our products um it's

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
pretty

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
it's an exciting place to work because

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,959
the

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,879
technology for developers is really

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,599
cutting edge so you definitely want to

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
be on this team

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,879
so we make software run by itself

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
everywhere

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
we build a future where software is not

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,120
just tied to centralized clouds

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
they really can be can run and be

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,080
operated everywhere

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,360
and anywhere which is really exciting so

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
right now we have 47

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,720
employees 19 are engineers on

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
three teams uh and we're in four

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
countries

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
primarily the united states we have some

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
folks in

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,479
canada primarily in toronto as well

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,959
as um as germany and italy

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,600
so that's where we are where we're

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
distributed

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
we're open source that's a big deal for

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,800
us um

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,720
and you know what i found is that this

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
the idea of open source is not

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
it's not just in the in the code as well

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
but in our

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
open source it definitely affects the

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,759
culture of the organization

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
it's a culture of transparency and again

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,919
we'll talk about that a little bit later

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,919
but really about how do we share

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,600
particularly for our team members how do

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,840
how does everyone have access to as much

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
information as possible to do their best

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
work

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
again some of the tech stack that we've

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,160
worked with this should be familiar

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
to many of you

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
so if you're interested in that kind of

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
stuff again please reach out

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
i want to make sure to connect you um

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,080
with our folks so you can

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,919
talk about what that means and

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
particularly when it comes to our hiring

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,039
process one of the things

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
the feedback the incredible feedback

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,000
that we get from

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,160
from candidates is that on the

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
engineering side when people

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,440
apply to positions to engineering

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
positions

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
but as well as happens in marketing and

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
sales as well

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
that you can expect to get really great

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,199
um

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,080
feedback um really honest feedback and

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
to have a straightforward process that

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,000
is

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,240
supportive in nature

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
when it comes to diversity just to be

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
really honest i mean something that is

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
uh

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,880
um is something that we're working on

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360
that we are not

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
as diverse as we would like to be um

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,199
currently we have nine female presenting

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,240
team members out of 47

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
um one in engineering um and

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,199
some of the things that we're doing is

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,039
being to track race and ethnicity

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,479
information so that we can look at

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,880
where we are um and where we're going

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
or to blog post um maybe about six

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
months ago in the future of women and

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
gravitational

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
you know and as well as um an article

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,560
about

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,240
how really nice companies can

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
can still um have

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
promote racism not promote racism but

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
really

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
um perpetuate racism even when they're

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
no racist

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,160
at the company um but how racism is

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
in the air that we breed as a society

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,039
and so how do we

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,160
continually do the work so that we can

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,599
be a very

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,360
inclusive environment um and we're all

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,840
you know we're all team members

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
candidates anyone who's um

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
engaged with gravitational can make sure

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,039
that they feel that um

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,560
inclusion um know that diversity is

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
something that's important

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
um and and that we're making sure that

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,120
we're doing the work in a really

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,039
profound way

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
and again please ask questions if

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,919
anything comes up um

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,080
whether in the chat or in the q a as

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
well

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
company culture which is one of my

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
favorite things to talk about and i

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
think really

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
important when looking at different um

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,400
companies and

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,639
and career opportunities um some of the

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,479
things that for us like we really

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
some of our values that we've done a lot

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
of work to make sure that as we grow and

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
as we scale and we're growing very

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,160
quickly

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,000
um that the things that are amazing

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,080
about us

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,840
today and the things that were amazing

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,639
about us at 25 people the things are

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,039
amazing

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
about us now at almost 50 people and the

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
things we want those

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
to continue to be the things that are

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,639
important when we're at 100

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,080
and 202 000 people so again i've talked

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
about this before

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,400
but having an open core culture um

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
what that really means from an

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
organizational standpoint is valuing

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
transparency

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
and some of the ways that that works

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,639
includes it's really important to write

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,720
things down

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
um to share everything that we do across

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
the company

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
we really believe that information

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
information silos breeds you know sense

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,840
of politics

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,440
and uh and really they're the antithesis

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
of productivity so we really try to make

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
sure that

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
you know everyone can get the

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,279
information that they need to do the

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,039
best job

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,640
and um and that we're really clear about

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,599
where the kind of single sources of

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,440
truth are

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
um for getting information so that's

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
really important

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,399
the idea of um thoughtfulness you know

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,040
sometimes our

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,640
this industry is really prone to very

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
fashionable trends

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,600
and we really try to dig into the

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,399
details to write down our options um

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
you know to really collaborate on on our

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,920
course of action

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
and um and we value thoughtfulness over

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
speed it's not just about like

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,680
moving fast but also being very

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
thoughtful in the process as well

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
we value honesty and honesty isn't

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
always

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,959
easy so we it it requires

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,240
courage on all of our part in order to

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
be honest

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,880
to open up to our individual mistakes to

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,480
take a stand in the industry

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,040
as a team and as leaders even when it's

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
against popular opinion and try to be

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,920
direct in our opinions

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,720
and and and our advice um in a very

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
thoughtful way

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,560
we also value humility this is not a

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,240
company of like really

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
big personalities um

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
that's that's not what we're that's not

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,399
what we're going for we're not arrogant

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
um

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,000
like i said we don't have these huge

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
personalities huge egos um instead we

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
really believe

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
that our work products should speak for

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,480
itself that our customer service should

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
speak for itself um

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,760
we're open to other ideas and we value

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
and respect

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
different um you know team members

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
experiences and

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,760
identities and uh contributions that's

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
super important

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
um so we do have strong opinions not to

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
say that we don't have strong opinions

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,560
um

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,680
you know we we're proud we're never too

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,200
proud to admit when we're

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,640
we're wrong to learn to grow um

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,760
and we want it we don't want to be too

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
opinionated that

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
we don't listen to another side because

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
that's where

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,079
you lose the innovation you really lose

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,959
the um

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,600
you know what the idea of being creative

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,600
and innovative

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,839
yeah just to go back a little bit we

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
have um we have offices in

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,000
in oakland seattle toronto right now

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,839
our offices are closed because after

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,279
from kobe 19

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,560
so um so everyone is working

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,480
from home right now and because of like

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
since shelter in place because we had to

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
go

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,800
from working in those

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
those offices our headquarters to

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,839
everyone working

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,440
from home overnight um what we realized

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
is that it made us much more

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
location agnostic and realizing that

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,440
what's most important is everyone

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,440
is comfortable where they're working

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
so hopefully that answers your question

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,519
jeff we're definitely

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,120
um remote working is absolutely possible

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,600
and part of one of our

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
values and i think this goes under um

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
thoughtfulness as well as

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,200
balance is especially for new employees

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,360
what is that experience of working from

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,920
home right from the very beginning

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
it's very different where especially for

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
more junior positions

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,240
coming in being new to a position new

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
being potentially new to a particular

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,200
career

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,519
and getting support getting mentoring um

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,600
you know what does that look like from a

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
remote and all remote environment and

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
again that goes back to the transparency

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,560
piece and making sure that everyone

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,320
has access to the important information

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
um and jonathan great question around

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,839
how do you keep ego

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,440
out of the workplace and i think there's

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,920
a couple different pieces to that

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,440
one is really our leaders um

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,800
being a good representation for that um

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,600
you know there's some and also

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,320
having a sense of balance so for our

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
leaders

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,480
the expectation is that they will model

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,639
what it looks like to keep ego out of

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,760
the workplace being good listeners

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,760
um being open to feedback valuing

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,440
feedback and soliciting feedback on a

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,519
regular basis

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
i think it's a transparency piece as

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,320
well of giving information and

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,440
and making sure that folks folks know

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
what's going on

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
um in a way that's thoughtful and really

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,079
uh thoughtful

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
and compassionate as well so i think

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,720
having being

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,480
um being a role model is a big part of

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
that and then and having that

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,959
really be the expectation of of everyone

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,680
um even when it comes down to the the

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
code

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
one of the things that um it's it may

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
seem

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
small but for our engineers we don't

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,880
have

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,240
cursing or offensive language in the

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,839
code and that's something that's been

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
there from the very beginning

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,279
um so something else would just model

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,800
that a sense of thoughtfulness

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,040
um kindness and respect

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
i think that all goes into reducing the

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,399
ego

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,920
increasing humility and honesty and

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
thoughtfulness and transparency and all

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
of those things

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,399
great questions

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,920
and then i think the last piece around

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
valuing balance um

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,160
we approach each other we approach our

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
work we approach our customers and our

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,079
community with the understanding

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
that we're running a marathon and not a

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
sprint

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,279
um we understand everyone has many

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
priorities especially

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,959
given this this global pandemic and

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
people working from home in lots of

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,720
different situations

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
um we've always been really strong

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,440
supporters of work-life balance and

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,600
we understand that true productivity is

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
only achievable with balance um that's

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
includes mind body and spirit so

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,000
you know having a focus on wellness too

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,760
and what we found and we really had to

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,880
be honest with ourselves is that

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,120
as this again with this global pandemic

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,320
what does it mean to have this work-life

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
balance

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
for example working in the oakland

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,720
office it was really easy

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,560
to for our leaders to model that

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
work-life balance because really after

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,720
five or six pm

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
everybody was gone the ceo was gone the

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,680
ceo was gone

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,959
you know in our seattle offices cto

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
would go home

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,959
um he would ride his bike home you know

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,079
people had interest they were with their

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,600
families

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,600
um it was very much like the company was

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,839
turned off at the end of the at the end

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,480
of the day um and what we're finding and

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
we're again

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
really being honest with ourselves is

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
that since the global pandemic and

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
people

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,800
you know working from home and managing

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
um

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,639
child care and schooling for younger

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,519
kids um

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,160
support for um parents and family

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,279
members

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,920
and just this life of whether you love

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,160
working from home or not or however

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,240
social you are or whatever it is

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,440
that it is different working remotely

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
um versus working remotely during a

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
global pandemic as well as everything

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
else that's happening

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,880
in the world so really looking at how do

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,040
we

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,880
um support employees during this time

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,880
um how do we really model that balance

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,800
when the world is not balanced and a lot

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,720
of people are finding that

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,160
it's become increasingly difficult to

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
feel that same sense of balance

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,000
so we continue to look at that so if

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
there's any things that um that you have

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,040
ideas about please feel free

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,839
i just want to add there too

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,839
um

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,920
so in just going back like here like

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,279
you'll find that

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,199
what i love too some of the things that

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,920
i love is that um

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,160
you know the the culture transitioning

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,320
to all remote was

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,079
easy um because we've always even though

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
we've had we've had multiple main

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
offices

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
the culture was very distributed um from

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
a technological place like those things

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,920
were

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
in place um you know there were many

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,279
things in place for us to make that

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
transition very smoothly

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,320
um having that open source

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,399
organizational culture

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
um again from a from a sense of

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,000
transparency

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,320
has has helped as well many people find

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
that our culture is in many ways very

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
almost academic in a way i think that's

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,120
the thoughtfulness of the humility as

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
well

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,279
you'll frequently find people talking

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
about the books that they're reading

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,759
um how it impacts their work um when

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
decisions are made it's like here's the

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,559
kind of

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,480
research or thinking that's behind this

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,360
decision or behind

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
the strategy in managing or in a

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,959
decision

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,839
or how things work so um there's there's

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,559
a level of

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,160
politeness um with our code of conduct

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,919
and engineering that really

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
resonates with the entire company about

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,360
being very respectful

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,160
so that's a little bit about our

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,200
company values some of our perks like

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
right now we're still

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
in this pandemic office budget with you

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,960
know where folks as they're coming on

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,600
um have a thousand dollars to

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
just make sure that their home work

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
environment feels comfortable

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,440
where they can do their best work um

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280
learning and development is really

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,559
important you have

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,240
one you know at least one conference

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,440
funded per year we really encourage

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
folks to develop their learning and

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,880
development

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
even though our you know off-site it may

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
be

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,679
virtual but we also find that we're

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
so we're just hoping that one day we can

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,240
all

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,360
get together again um it was really

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,760
a lot of our connective activities have

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,559
been

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,600
virtual and we tried to be really

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
creative so

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,640
not you know we started you know we had

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,360
our virtual

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
um happy hours um but we've also done

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,400
some other things like our

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,919
like i'm going to drive in theaters

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
together

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,840
with all over the country and all over

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,480
the world whether it's toronto seattle

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,320
oakland atlanta um you know folks

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
showing up to their own

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,760
drive-in theaters and being able to

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,720
share back what um

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,679
you know what they saw um we have a

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
halloween

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,799
costume contest that's coming up we've

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,120
done cooking classes together

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
um so just really trying to just making

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
sure that we stay

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
connected um in terms of learning two

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,360
week we really have

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,919
lunch and learns we just today um

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,559
working with one of our engineers to

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,400
share

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,000
um to get feedback on a workshop that

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,080
he'll be doing around

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,679
git 101 get 102 as well as 201 and 202

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,679
um so that both for

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,000
on our technical staff as well as our

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,400
non-technical staff being able to

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
to learn more about how to be efficient

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,880
and effective on

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,840
github and with git and

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
as well as our ceo last week did a

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,320
presentation

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,440
on seo which was super interesting

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,640
so um coming up in a couple weeks our

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,600
our ceo will be presenting so really

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
making sure that there's

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,360
ongoing opportunities for learning and

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
development especially because

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
the kind of work that we do can be

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,640
extremely technical um and from there's

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
so much to learn in all of our

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
departments

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,200
and i think that's one thing that's

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760
exciting and one thing that people

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
when they're joining a startup it's

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,880
about learning it's about growing and

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
it's about the opportunity to have

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
access to much more learning that you

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
might

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
do if you're kind of siloed with a much

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
larger company so we really

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
really want to take that take advantage

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
of that

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,720
and continue to offer opportunities for

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,720
learning and growing

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,559
so that is some of our work we have some

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,679
time i want to make sure that we left

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,880
some time

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,200
for questions for thoughts um

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
you know what what are some things that

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,720
stand out to you

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,840
um what are some of your your interests

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
and things that you want to know more

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
about

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah great question so jonathan asked um

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
about target head count to higher for

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
the next three months

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,360
so during the um you know obviously

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,480
we're still in the pandemic but

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,240
from about maybe march for about

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,640
maybe four or five months we had a

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
hiring freeze um just because we wanted

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,120

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
you know conservative and really watch

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,080
and see what's happening with this

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,440
um you know with this pandemic and

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,360
its impact on the company um so now

and i think what's also really

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
interesting is that you know as

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,559
as a startup and as a company that's

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,279
really scaling very quickly

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,720
it's really important it's great to um

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,960
to have

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
diversity in the kind of levels whether

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,880
folks on the junior side

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,480
or advanced side being able to

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,880
get folks from all those different

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,880
levels

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,120
yeah so what especially being here for

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,120
the last almost a year now which is so

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,960
surprising that it's been a year

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,960
almost a year but some of the things

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,279
that i enjoy about being gravitational

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,240
be it's that it's very much a company of

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,520
grown-ups

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,360
um just being respectful being very

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,480
kind and generous in mind and

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,679
thought um i'm not uh this is

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,000
coming to a startup world is very much

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,320

was very much new to me um but i'm so

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,880
thankful for

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,480

you know and the the kindness and

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,200
thoughtfulness of folks

others being able to to share and ask

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,120
questions and

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,120
and not feel like an idiot um

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,559

and being able to to do work in a place

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,840

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
background

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,880
research and um so really not just being

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,799
reckless and how we make decisions but

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
being very thoughtful about that

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,840
um i do appreciate that a lot

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,840
other questions and thoughts

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,000
and thank you everyone for participating

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,919
for joining here today

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,120
i expect to see a lot more folks from

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,159
from north carolina

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,720
from austin from you know wherever you

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,720
are

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
working um here gravitational

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,120
and i and also i'll speak for you know

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,679
not just myself but i know that again

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,279
like that

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,279
the full um the open open core

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,120
environment and open core culture i

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,840
think what's exciting about that too

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,799
for engineers is that um as you grow and

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,080
develop and

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,320
whether gravitational is your um

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,840
the last place you ever work that you

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,360
you can really share

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,840
what it is that you've done as an

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,399
employee and i think that um

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,640
that is on the open court side but even

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,760
for me and human resources

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,320
being encouraged to

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
write blogs and to share expertise

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,440
publicly

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,520
that's really exciting so that being

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,960
able to

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,320
have a that i've

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,200
created um in while working here at

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,480
gravitational

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,720
having that um be open to the public

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,240
i really think it creates a sense of

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,240
leadership and

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,120
it's been exciting to see over the past

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,200
year even folks as they transition from

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,799
um one part of the company to another

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,360
part of the company because they have

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,279
grown in their skills and talents and

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,120
um folks that you know i can think of

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,240
one person who started off in sales

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,159
and then just as they developed their

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,679
their writing and sharing in terms of

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
blogs and webinars

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,520
and moved over to the marketing side and

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,480
that's just really exciting to see

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,600
because that it shows um growth and

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,399
encouragement

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,240
and both managers and leaders being able

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,399
to see potential

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:51,840
and growth and really encouraging that

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,840
and nurturing that

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:19,840
other thoughts and questions

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
all right thank you so much i really

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,519

look forward to hearing from you

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,399
um kathy yeah there's another question

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,240
in the chat from jonathan

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,000
okay oh about the um

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,360
almost important value you look for in

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
hiring candidates that's a great

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,279
question

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,200
i mean in addition to obviously

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,919
skills um that those cultural values are

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
are really important as well um like do

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,039
you fit into that those cultural values

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,080
like i named and

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,200
go back there to um so

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,600
this is why we try to be really

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,880
important like you know can someone

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,559
be um you know value do you value

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,600
transparency and thoughtfulness and

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,440
honesty

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,120
and humility and balance as much as we

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,720
do because that's going to be really

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,559
important because those are values that

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,480
are significant to the company

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,480
um and i think one of the things again

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,919
that i enjoy about gravitational is that

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,600
as a startup

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,679
it is really important to our founders

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,679
to bring on human resources

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
earlier rather than later and part of

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,039
that was that

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,640
many times some startups bring in human

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,279
resources when they've gotten into

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
trouble

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,559
or when there's a problem but

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,200
gravitationals a company

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,440
is a company where it's like we love who

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,039
we are and we really value who we are

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,279
and we want to maintain that

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,399
um especially through scale and through

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,360
rapid growth

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,240
um and so how do we you know how do we

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,600
make sure

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,640
that we continue to do that and to um

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,840
you know develop in that to develop and

quickly

questions this is your opportunity

and not your only opportunity either

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,130
and for our hiring on the engineering

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,800
side we have um

00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,520
[Music]

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,079
you know engineers do a coding challenge

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,879
and

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,159
again you know it's not it's it's meant

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,440
to be very um

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,919
developmental um to get a sense of

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,000
where you are in addition to the

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,160
interview process but from

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
um to be very direct and transparent in

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,440
terms of what we're looking for

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,320
um what level we think you are

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,920
as an engineer um and all of that laid

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
out very clearly so

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,320
again what our engineering candidates um

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,040
speak highly about is that

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,240
process that is transparent and

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,359
thoughtful

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,320
and really carefully developed and

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,520
and with as little bias as possible um

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,880
to make sure that we have

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,480
um you know information about how can

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,920
you be as successful

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,359
as possible where you are and both where

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,920
your growth areas are and where your

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,920
strengths are

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,240
yeah absolutely and jeff i think what's

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,640
great is that

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,359
being because you're really clear about

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,599
that

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,920
um i think the one both from a technical

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,560
perspective as well as

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,960
from a growth perspective knowing that

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
um

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,000
you know being clear what are the skills

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
that you bring to the table

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,079
and where your skills may be best suited

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,560
for the company now

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,520
as well as thinking very future oriented

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,800
and being

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,400
um and communicating that with managers

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,839
and leadership around

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,040
where you like to go um and developing a

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,359
plan for that

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,800
so that's a great question um and it's

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,920
always helpful kind of going in and

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,000
thinking about

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,200
and coming in with a very growth

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,040
oriented

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,839
lens and there's so many opportunities

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,839
with a startup for that

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,359
and again things like the coding

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,079
challenge being having that

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,800
give a sense of where folks are

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,440
technically

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,560
when they apply for a position and then

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
being really clear

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,880
about you know the different positions

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,160
and what you might need

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,560
from a systems administrator piece or um

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,599
our qa engineer piece what what the what

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,320
the gaps

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,960
between developing into a development

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,599
engineer

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,760
what that looks like and what it would

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:23,839
what it means to

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:23,839
close those gaps and be prepared

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,880
thanks for answering all of your

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,320
questions

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
i love it i really appreciate the

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
questions

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,960
and for you all i'm interested um oh

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
thank you

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
uh and i also want to hear kind of what

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
are you looking for in a company what

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,079
are you looking for

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,359
um you know if you're actively looking

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,720
or not actively looking

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,480
um what are some of the things that

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,440
you're looking in terms of the candidate

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,560
process

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,359
as well as in a company values

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,359
that interest you

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,440
yeah so in terms of measuring success in

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,599
the company as a developer

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,480
one we want to see growth and

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,920
development

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,640
so we have a range of levels from one to

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,760
six

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,599
and wherever you are on that continuum

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,880
making it very clear so for example

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,119
what does it mean to be a level three

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,800
engineer um what would it take to become

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,200
a level four engineer like being very

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,920
clear

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,079
on um the kinds of skill and development

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,760
that needs so it's very transparent

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,680
in terms of what you what it is that you

00:38:43,760 --> 00:39:01,839
need

00:38:45,680 --> 00:39:01,839
and how you can grow and develop

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,040
and i think that that kind of

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,839
transparency is really important

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,320
so that being really clear about what it

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,040
is that

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,160
um is success what does success look

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,200
like on your particular

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,920
team and in your particular position but

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,920
how you contribute to the company's

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,079
overall success as well

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
and part of that too is us really

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,760
getting clear

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
from as an operations plan around what

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,079
does our

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,320
what is our company where we are

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,440
currently where we're going and what we

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,680
need to get there

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,800
and how everyone's role fits into that

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,960
so that's something that we

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,160
continue to to clarify um so that folks

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,320
know um and know where their work fits

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,320
in

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,280
we also use objectives and key results

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,440
okrs

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
if you're familiar with that as a way to

00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:11,839
help us measure our

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:11,839
success as teams

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,599
great question pearl um what strengths

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
do you think are most important in a

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,319
developer

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
um in addition to the you know technical

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,520
skills

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,920
um being very growth oriented

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,319
having you know having our company

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,240
values in mind

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,680
and i say being growth-oriented and

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,960
having a

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,480
growth mindset uh being very clear

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,920
where and clear and self-aware about

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
where your talents are now and what it

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,520
would take

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,560
to grow um so those are really important

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,359
in

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,599
looking at candidates and as well as

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,319
assessing our developers can you

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,359
can you and are you willing to learn um

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,400
and learn quickly

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,880
and ask questions um

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,720
you know sometimes especially when when

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,359
our team members come on as new

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,200
um new team members i find that like

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,280
you'll ask questions like okay or do you

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,720
have any questions and folks are like

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,400
no no i don't have questions like don't

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,040
be shy about asking questions

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,079
if you're not asking questions then then

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,760
i'm worried

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
um but if you are asking a lot of

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,480
questions and willing to

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,400
to reach out and really and that's what

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,400
we encourage for our managers too

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,280
is that don't take um no questions

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,319
as an as an answer right but really it's

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,560
not about

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,599
um do you have questions as a team

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
member but

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,800
what are some questions that you do have

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,960
and to really

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,720
encourage that environment of asking

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,520
questions of growing

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,800
um and continuing to be self-aware about

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,359
where you are and where

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,119
potential gaps are and about closing

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,079
those gaps and learning and developing

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,160
and growing

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:17,839
and based on what it is that we need to

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:17,839
get the job done

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:31,839
