	Presented by: Stormy Peters, Microsoft
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Case Study/Demo Track

Abstract: Come learn about how to change the culture of an organization, create open source software policies and implement a compliance toolkit. Learn how to incorporate open source software into strategic decisions and run entire projects in the open, including product management.

Over the past decade, Microsoft’s approach to open source software has changed. Microsoft went from using no open source to leading some of the top open source software projects on GitHub. Along the way, Microsoft learned how to create an effective open source software policy, run entire projects in the open, including product management, strike a balance between open source expertise and business strategy, bring the best of our diversity and inclusion to open source and create easy to use compliance tooling. We are still learning, so we’d like to share our experiences and hear from yours!

Come learn how Microsoft has changed its culture, how it runs its Open Source Programs Office and what it’s learned along the way.

um

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,720
i wish we were all in person but i'm

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
super glad we get to have this

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,240
conversation

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,559
anyway um i'd really encourage you i

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,920
like

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
i like presentations to be really

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
interactive if it's not interactive i

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
could have just recorded it and emailed

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
it to you

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,160
um so let's let's do what we can to make

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,560
this interactive

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
if you have a comment or a question or a

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
story to share

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,119
uh feel free to drop it and chat or to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,239
ask a question in the q

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,880
a um or if if you want to speak it

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,280
um like like marley said just uh hit

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
your

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
raise your hand and she can unmute you

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
um

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
i'm not super good at talking and

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
reading at the same time so if i don't

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
see your question or it looks like i

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
didn't see it i feel free to raise your

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,760
hand and talk

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
um you might have noticed that the title

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,000
of this presentation was seven lessons

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,680
and i don't have a number seven on the

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,440
slide i think there's actually eight

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,239
lessons in here there's probably a lot

00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
more

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,359
um but what i would challenge you all is

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
to think about what lessons you've

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,479
learned as well

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
um and then at some point during this

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,640
talk or right afterwards

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
um go and tweet um some lesson that

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
you've learned about working with open

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
source software

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
um tweet it to your followers you can

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
tag me i'm at storming

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
um or you can drop in chat here but i'd

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
love to have everybody in the audience

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
think about

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
a lesson or two that they've learned

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
working with open source software um and

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,799
share it with us as well because

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
i certainly don't have all the answers

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
microsoft doesn't have all the answers

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
we're all here together to figure that

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,920
out

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
um so i thought i would start with a

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
brief introduction of who i am

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,000
i've actually spent the last 20 years

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
working with open source software

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
i was at hewlett packard when i wanted

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,640
to port gnome

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
to hpox i actually realized that all of

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
these companies had

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,079
teams of people working on open source

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,720
working on cde

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,000
the user interface for hpx and we were

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
not only developing the same

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,560
functionality because we all went to

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
standards groups and decided what it

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
would look like and then we'd all go

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
back and write code to do that

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
but we even had like identical lists of

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
bugs that we were going to fix

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,800
and i just thought that was like crazy

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
um i had a team of people

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
solving the exact same problems that sun

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
did that ibm did

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
and i thought there's got to be a better

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,520
way luckily for for me and for us

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
um open source was around linux was just

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
starting to become popular

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
it's about the year 2000 um and i

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
thought we could

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
linux has not just one but two desktops

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
and we could take one of those

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
and and use it and work on it and

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
contribute to it and it turned out not

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
to be a technical problem it turned out

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,560
to be a business problem

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
i got to learn a lot about open source

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
software i got to learn a lot about

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,160
licenses i went and took a copy

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,440
copyright class um and it and i ended up

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
creating one of the very first open

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
source programs offices at hp

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,720
um since then i spent most of my career

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160
trying to help different groups

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,800
understand each other so

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,239
helping business leaders understand

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,840
development developers understand

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
business reasons helping open source

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,959
software communities understand

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
companies and companies understand open

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
source software communities why do they

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
do it for free

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
um so i've kind of played a bridge and

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
i've gone through nonprofits and

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
companies and startups and large

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
companies

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
um and now i'm at microsoft where i lead

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
the open source programs office

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
microsoft has been through quite the

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
open source journey um they did a lot of

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
it

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
all of it before i got here um but i

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
wanted to share with you

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
on what they've done because i think

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
it's relevant um to many companies and

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
to many people looking to advance open

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
source software

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,680
at any time you are welcome to drop your

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,000
own question or comment in the chat

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
so all of you are here you probably know

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
that open source software is here to

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
stay

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,599
but i was looking at some of these

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
numbers and they're they're really crazy

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,400
they're crazy numbers and there's 55

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
million developers working

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
just on open source software that's

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
located on github that's 55 million

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,480
people worldwide

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,680
and what's even crazier about that is 10

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,000
million of those people

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
joined within the last year so we've

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
grown at like 25

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,519
just over the last year in the number of

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
individuals contributing to open source

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
software

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
and another stat that i think is is

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
really awesome and maybe all of you are

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
around the globe

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
i don't i can't pull the audience and

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
see where you're from um

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,319
but 80 of those contributors are not in

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,599
the united states so this is a very

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
global community

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,799
and stat i find even more amazing is if

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,959
you take average repo

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,479
on github um they have an average of 41

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
countries represented among the

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,479
contributors um so really

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,919
really impressive numbers unlike open

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,759
source software isn't just here to stay

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,199
it's actually like

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
it is a thing um and then i wanted to

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,600
point out

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
this is a study that came out just a

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
month or two ago from mckinsey and

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
company

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
um that showed that the companies that

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
use open source software are 30

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
more innovative and i think even more

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
important um

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
and there's been a number of studies

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
have pointed at this developers at

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
companies that get to use open source

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
software are much more satisfied and

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
they stay longer

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
and and that's because they're getting

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
to use the tools that they they want to

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,560
use it's more efficient kind of like my

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
first job

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
where i was like well i can't believe

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
we're fixing bugs that other people are

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
fixing the same bugs you know open

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
source kind of

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
helps us all work together and build on

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
the work of others um

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
we even see this at interns at microsoft

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
so the interns come and want to

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,680
work on open source software and they're

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
excited and that's that's one of the

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
rewards

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,840
of an internship at microsoft is when

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,840
they get to work on open source software

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,759
um so so i like to say in a um

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,759
so i wanted to point out in case you had

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
any doubts that microsoft is experienced

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,080
with open source software and i'll talk

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
about that in a minute

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
um we have thirty thousand employees the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
slide says twenty seven thousand but

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,039
we're just about thirty thousand

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,880
thirty thousand employees who have

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
linked their microsoft identity

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960
to their github identity so this is a

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
might always be a developer might be a

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
developer a product manager might even

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
be an executive

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
has taken their microsoft identity and

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
said yes i am that person on github and

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
it's a voluntary

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,479
association that they don't have to do

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,199
and of those 30 000

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,600
employees they've created 10 000 repos

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
in microsoft organizations on github

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
and if you look at the top 10 projects

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,720
on github by number of contributors

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
um you can see the top couple are

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
microsoft projects

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
in particular our developer tools team

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
is very active in open source

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
with projects like vscode.net and

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
typescript

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
we also have a really strong

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
documentation community our

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
accessibility tools are out there

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
so we've really discovered that open

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
source software is a great way to work

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,440
it's a great way to work with our

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
customers

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
and it's been quite the journey so the

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
story that i like to share and i just

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
have

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,880
um the slide and then i'm gonna actually

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,960
get into how we do it at microsoft

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
um but the story that i like to share is

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
that i think the very first contribution

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
that microsoft made to open source

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
software

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,360
was to be the common enemy and so i was

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,280
actually at the gnome foundation

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,440
around 2005 2006 and we saw microsoft

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,599
windows as the biggest competition

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,960
as the enemy and we partnered with our

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
open source competition

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,199
um so we partnered with kde in order to

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,560
try to beat microsoft windows

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
so that was microsoft's very first

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,360
contribution um they've come a long way

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
since we've open sourced many things

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
we've adopted

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,240
both open source usage internally as

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
well as open sourcing things

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
microsoft is one of the the largest

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,440
contributors to the linux kernel which

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,199
often surprises things

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,560
and um if you watch the news we've been

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
open sourcing projects

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
um regularly i think one of the most

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
recent ones was a fluid framework out of

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,039
the the windows office team

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
um so we're we're always constantly

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
working

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,160
with it um and i think that's that's

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
been a it's been a long journey both

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
inside microsoft to convince people and

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
outside microsoft to convince them that

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
we're really genuine

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
about collaborating

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,759
so how do we do that at microsoft and

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,440
what lessons might we have learned that

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,039
might be useful to somebody else

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
um so i run the open source programs

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,440
office and our job at microsoft

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
is to make sure that all the other teams

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,879
at microsoft can use open source

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
software effectively and safely and

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,319
securely and as easily as possible

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
so we actually have over 5 million

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,479
usages of

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,479
open source software components in

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,560
microsoft so this is a

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
you know component can be small and it

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
might be reused by multiple

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,599
teams but we are tracking over five

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
million instances of mic

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,680
of open source software just used at

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,560
microsoft not to mention those 10 000

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
repos that we've open sourced

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
and in order to do this i thought i

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,479
removed all the build across

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,640
the slide and we partner across the

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,080
organization so i actually get

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,760
um i talked to a lot of microsoft

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
customers about open source

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,800
and a lot of them are interested in

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
creating an open source programs office

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
even ones that aren't in the software

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,839
industry so i talked to

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
banks and you know retail

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
department stores that you might have

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,880
got into um and they're all interested

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
in creating an open source programs

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
office

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,120
and one of the first questions that they

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
ask me is where should it live

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
like should it be in legal should it be

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,680
in engineering should it be in the

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
office of the cto

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,839
and my answer is it has to involve all

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
those people it doesn't really matter

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
where it lives

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
as long as you work with all those

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
people um so at microsoft

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,440
our open source programs office team is

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
pretty small um we're about

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
six seven people um but we work very

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,600
closely with legal so we have a legal

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
team that just focuses on open source

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,839
software

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
and they were really instrumental in the

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,880
beginning and helping us with that

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
culture change

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
they also now help us set the policies

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
review licenses

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
talk to teams that have questions so

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
legal is key

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
hr is key because we actually measure

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
employees at microsoft you know when you

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,399
do it's not an annual evaluation it's a

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
quarterly evaluation i think

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
um there's three questions on there and

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
all three are super relevant to open

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
source software

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
um but one is like did they build on the

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,399
work of others

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
like instead of not inventing it all

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,360
themselves did they take the work of

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
others and did they build on it

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
and did they help others um succeed and

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
i think open source software like

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
that that's key to that in engineering

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
um did you

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,399
take existing solutions and build on

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,000
them and did you help your colleagues

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
with the problems that that you saw

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
there that you could help with

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,440
and we also work really closely with the

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,240
security and accessibility teams

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
um the security team focuses a lot on

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
helping make sure the open source supply

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
chain is secure

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
we recently joined the open ssf group

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
out of the linux foundation

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
a lot of work happens there

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
accessibility is an area where i think

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
we have a lot to contribute

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
and we've open sourced our accessibility

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,880
tools and they're available to all

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
open source software projects and then

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
we created a couple

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,560
of groups across microsoft um just to

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
help

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,040
spread best practices um across so each

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
each business unit at microsoft

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,720
decides for themselves what their

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,240
strategy is and how open source

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,600
software's a part of that so like the

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
developer tools team

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,279
that has open source you know vs code

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,839
and net and typescript

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,440
they've adopted like develop in the open

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
work closely with our customers for our

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
developers our users

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
um and many of their things are just

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
open source kind of by default

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
um teams like microsoft office and

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
windows are dealing with large

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
proprietary

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
products you know they already have and

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
they're figuring out how open source

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
software can be a part of that

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
they use open source software but they

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
also open source parts that make sense

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
um

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,519
that they can open source and so things

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,920
like fluid framework just came out of

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
that

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,800
so the point of my story is that the

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,480
the open source exec council that we

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
have is a group of executives from

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
across those businesses

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
they come together once a quarter and

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
discuss how they're using open source

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
software in their strategies

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,040
um what's working what's not working um

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,920
any escalations they've had

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,480
any like ahas or best practices and they

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,160
share those with each other

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
and we also have a group but we also

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
work externally with a lot of our

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
industry peers

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
um a lot of linux foundation groups the

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
to do group

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
a lot of foundations like the apache

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
foundation but i want to talk about one

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
of their internal group too

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,320
is that we have a group called open

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
source champs um who are more at the

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
developer level

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,120
they're also from across microsoft um

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,639
they get together more often we have

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
like a coffee chat every month

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
we have like a teams chat room where we

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,920
chat all the time

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,519
um and they share best practices and

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,560
they're kind of like a first line of

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,240
of expertise um for their businesses

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,839
um so if someone in their businesses i'm

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,320
thinking about open sourcing this

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
how am i gonna set it up so i can grow a

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
community

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,839
and they would be there to help answer

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
those types of questions

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
and so we work closely with engineers oh

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,240
the other group that i didn't mention is

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
that we have an open source software

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,880
engineering group

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
and this is a group we have a team that

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,800
helps build builds

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
on tools for all of microsoft and within

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
that team

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,519
they have an open source team that helps

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,880
build tools just for open source offer

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
and in the next slide i'm going to talk

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,800
about some of the things that we do

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,839
there

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,839
um so if you were

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,320
if you are at microsoft um well you're

00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
going to have to take a screenshot of

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
that

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
i don't know why it's not staying there

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
um i'll go back

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,200
so if you were at um microsoft and

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
a developer and you download open source

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
software which you're allowed to do and

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
check it out and you put it into your

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,839
build environment and you build that

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,079
open source software into your tools

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
um we have tools that will automatically

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,959
detect that when you do a build

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
and it'll figure out that you're using

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,480
open source software it will figure out

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,079
what license you're using

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,000
it'll figure out whether or not that

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,279
license is just okay to use which is the

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,880
majority of the cases

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
or it might say you know there's some

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,560
risk here i think you really need a

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,600
it'll kick off a legal review or a

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,360
business review

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,279
and make sure that you get what you need

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
and then it'll say oh you need a notice

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
file for this

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
if you do and it'll create one for you

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
um if you need to host the source code

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
somewhere before you ship the product

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
there's a place for that um so there's

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
just a lot of tools

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
that work in the background to help make

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
sure developers are doing the right

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,680
thing and making the right choices

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
and that's really key because when

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,199
someone's using open source software you

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
want to make life really easy for them

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,560
you don't want to tell the developer oh

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
if you want to use that library

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,600
you're going to go have to fill out a

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,680
form and request to use it

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
and wait two weeks and you know then

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,320
maybe you can use it

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
at that point they've picked another

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
tool they've moved on

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,839
and they're not interested in anymore so

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,839
our tooling is really to help them

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
be able to just download that library

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,399
and start using it

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,160
we'll kick off reviews if needed we'll

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
figure out the licenses

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,480
but let them keep doing their job and

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,959
keep building awesome software

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
so once again quick look at that process

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,839
and what it looks like in a visual

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
oh that time it's going to stay

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,079
um and then what we've done is is tried

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
to share many of these tools um with the

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,600
world

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,959
um and so and i see we have a question

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
has microsoft thought about open

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
sourcing their open source detection

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,639
i'm just about to talk about that but

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
yes we have some parts are easy

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
to open source and some aren't um so

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
it's actually multiple tools that work

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
together

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
um so on the microsoft open source

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,040
portal repo

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
on github and there's actually a lot of

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
um

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,240
projects that we use not so much to

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,720
detect open source but projects that we

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,279
use to help microsoft employees

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
on github and we have just little tools

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,760
like

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,000
you can see here it says stormy peters

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
fte so when i'm running around github

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,760
um i can actually see who is a microsoft

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,720
employee or who has elected to identify

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
their microsoft

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
identity with their github identity um

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,600
that's often useful especially if

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
there's like a

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
if there was like a code of conduct

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
violation and i got a notice of it on a

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
microsoft project

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
i could easily go to the project and see

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
who's a microsoft employee who could

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
maybe help me out

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and answer that so it's often useful so

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,839
there's a bunch of tools there

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,040
everything from like detecting that

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
there's no admins

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,279
on this repo that we're supposed to be

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,199
maintaining or that there's 200 admins

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,199
which is kind of a security issue

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
um so we have a bunch of tools there um

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,600
on the detection side we've actually

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,720
created

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,399
um a couple of larger projects

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,759
that we're collaborating with others so

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
clearly defined

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,240
is the project um where we figure out

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,399
what license the package is under

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,519
um so one of the problems that we had

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
was that

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
we would discover the open source

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,160
software and then when we would go to

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
figure out what license it had

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,880
like the license field might be blank um

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
or the license field might say

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,519
something that made no sense like maybe

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,880
it's a typo instead of mit they put mti

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,279
and the tools can't really figure that

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,920
out very well or maybe it would say um

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,360
it would say um we have a

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
sorry i was reading and talking at the

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,839
same time and like i said i'm not very

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,279
good at that

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,480
um it might hey it's an mit license but

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
then when we actually look through the

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,519
source code

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,519
through the files um it would be a gpl

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,360
file in there and so the license

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,480
information was really inconsistent and

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
not very helpful

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
um so we created this project called

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,680
clearly defined we now have a number of

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
companies that are working on it with us

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,480
it's you know

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,480
microsoft github and the united nations

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
foundation and eclipse foundation

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,639
and bloomberg and others are either

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,880
using the data or contributing

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
and it's an api that you can query and

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
figure out what license

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,559
your project is under so we if you're at

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,480
a company that cares about licensing for

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
large numbers of projects i think it's

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
not quite as useful if you're an

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
individual that's just using one or two

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,120
projects

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
but if you're using a lot of them and

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,679
you need to verify licenses

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
super useful um we have meetings every

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,720
other monday

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,559
um and then there's discord and other

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,120
ways to get involved it's on github

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,720
so please come join us and the other one

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,240
that we created was after

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,080
um and i got derek's question so

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
if i didn't get answer your question or

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,919
if i haven't answered by the end of the

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,080
slide derek

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
uh feel free to jump back in there um

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,919
the other project that we

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,039
that we created um is we had customers

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
that would come to us

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,080
um in particular it seemed to be a lot

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
of german customers

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
um and they would say you're giving us

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,760
software

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,679
and we're deploying that software and we

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,600
know it has open source software in it

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,280
and we really need to know that you did

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
the right thing and we need to know that

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
we're doing the right thing

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
so could you please tell us all the open

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,000
source software you're using in all the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
ways that all the license is in there

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,760
and all the ways that you verified that

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,080
it's right we have five

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
million components deployed across

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,440
microsoft products

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
we wanted to make sure that when we

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
answered that question we answered it in

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
a helpful way

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
so we didn't want to give them like a

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,200
stack of papers that was like

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,799
10 feet high and say you know here's all

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
the software here's all the licenses

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,440
have added

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
um so we actually worked with the linux

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,039
foundation this was our legal group but

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
microsoft

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,320
worked with the linux foundation and

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
started an

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
uh standard so like an iso standard like

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
you think like software standard

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
um to describe what it means to be open

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,080
source compliant

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,080
um and they call it open chain and it

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,679
describes like

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
what types of roles your company should

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,640
have what the responsibilities are

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
um it describes what kind of training

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
you should have

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,799
um what kind of documentation you should

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,679
have around open source what kind of

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,200
processes

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,120
and then you can certify yourself as

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
open chain compliance and then you know

00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,679
that any company that's open chain

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
compliance

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
has a good compliance process for

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,960
dealing with open source software

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
it may not always be perfect but it's a

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
good process and they have a process for

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
like if they make a mistake how they're

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,799
gonna deal with it

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
so i think that's a really good best

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,840
practice

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
in a way for companies to establish

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,200
trust in the supply chain across

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
companies

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
and just as a reminder like if you have

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
a question or you have an example

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
or you have something to share um feel

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,880
free to drop it in chat feel free to

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,200
drop in the q

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,840
a or raise your hand and you can speak

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,440
it um the moderator will unmute you

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,880
um and remember you're supposed to be

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
thinking of one lesson

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
either that i'm presenting that was new

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,400
to you or that

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
you thought of during this presentation

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,799
and go ahead and tweet it

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,799
and you can share and chat with us too

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
um so one of the things that that we

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,600
found that was that was super

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,039
useful when we had developers working

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,760
with open source software

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,200
is how close it brought our developers

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
um to the users

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,880
so at a company like microsoft you know

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,960
we have 50 000

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,640
developers for writing software and they

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,280
don't they don't all

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
normally talk to the customer directly

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,640
this is the number of paths that

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
information gets from the customer to

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
the developer

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,679
for example the sales team gets

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,960
requirements and requests directly from

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,640
the customer

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,280
those trickle back into the developer

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,880
probably through product marketing

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
product marketing often gets to go out

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
to the customer and ask questions about

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,080
how they're using it

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,760
um and what they found and what they

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,039
like and what they don't like

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,039
and they're very good at coming back to

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,720
the developers and presenting that and

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,799
sharing that customer information

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
but again it's second hand um the

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
support team

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,360
definitely works very closely with the

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,200
customers and i don't have a slide on

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
that but the how we do support in the

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
open source software world is

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
is actually really interesting um

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,039
because a lot of developers

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,080
end up coming to the github repo for

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
support

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,200
um instead of through our normal support

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,799
channels and how we deal with that and

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
how the support team deals with that is

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,480
quite interesting

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,159
um but in the open source software world

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
the developer instead of getting all of

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,120
their information from the customer

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,520
through those three or four different

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,120
channels they are actually the customer

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
can come find them in github and ask

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,960
them a question

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,640
um and that's really good um it's it's

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,320
rewarding to our developers

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
they're more likely to stay and work on

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,280
the project when they get to see and

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,559
hear how people are using it

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
and it means the feedback from the

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,200
customer is not filtered through anybody

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
else's

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
lens or ears before it hits the

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
developer it also means the customer

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,400
could

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
suggest a change and a pull request or

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
actually

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,280
help vet ideas as they come out so that

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
we quickly

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,840
know whether an idea is going to work

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
for them or not before we spend a lot of

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,640
time developing it packaging and

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,360
shipping it

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,799
so the connecting developers to users

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,840
has been really

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,120
really key a key way that open source

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,840
software has helped us across our

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,679
development life cycle

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,600
so we have a question from an attendee

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,039
that says in our organization

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
we have a process called third party

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,559
approvals which is a manual process

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
we have to go to a tool and create the

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,520
approval process and there's a legal

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,799
team that looks at each third party tour

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
library and approves it

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
it takes a great amount of time creating

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
one by the developer and takes two weeks

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
for the approval team to approve

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,760
how can the tools that you explain help

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
reduce this time

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,280
yeah so when we detect open source

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,120
software and we detect the license

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,880
a large number of them we have decided

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,440
do not need approval

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,960
um and our tooling helps us feel

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
confident that we really know what

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,440
license the the project is under

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,600
um so if if um

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,200
if the license is under like an mit

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,440
license

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,960
we just say okay you're free to use that

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,559
software you know and it doesn't

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
we also have a list of like software

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,600
that's flagged for different reasons

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,120
if it's not flagged for any reason and

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,120
it's under mit license

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,880
you can just go ahead and use it um if

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
we found out it was a gpl license we

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
would

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
ask you a few more questions the tool

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,280
would ask you a few more questions so it

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
would ask you

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,880
um are you planning to ship this how are

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,240
you building it you know we have a few

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
questions to determine

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,559
whether or not um the copy left clause

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,840
is invoked or not

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,760
um and if it wasn't clear or if it was

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,360
the copyleft license was invoked then we

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,120
would kick off a legal review and a

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,720
business review because we would want

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
the legal team to actually look at it

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,679
and we would want um the business

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,600
plead for that that group to to verify

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,080
that that's really what they want to do

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,760
um or if it was a license if we didn't

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,120
know the license um first of all we

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
would open up an issue the tool would

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
open up an issue to

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,240
or the developer themselves could do it

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,760
um to go investigate what the license is

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
um but we would also kick off a legal

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
review so that somebody from the legal

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,840
team

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,679
could help figure out what the license

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,360
so i don't i don't remember the

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
percentage of the top of my head but

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,520
it's

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,799
it's over 80 probably closer to 90

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,200
of usage just gets approved by the tool

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,320
and the developer doesn't even see that

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
like it's just

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
part of the build environment one of the

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
tabs that has information about open

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
source software

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,400
they could go look at it if they wanted

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,600
to um so by taking that number down to a

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,799
much smaller number it's

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,200
it's much faster for most use cases um

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,960
then the tooling itself actually clicks

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
off and we might ask them questions but

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,159
they don't have to go to a tool um to

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
request

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,320
to use it when they use it it says hey

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,279
you need to ask permission if they do

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,120
um and it kicks off those reviews so i

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
think that answers your question of how

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,039
for us

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,720
tooling is is making it much faster

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,159
now there is a manual process so if you

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,640
want to

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
explore it something before you actually

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
download it and build it or you want to

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
open source something

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,320
you can go to the approval process tool

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,919
and and fill out an approval process

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
i started not using the right words here

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,039
you can fill out a ticket and it

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
get at issue and it gets sent off

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
the the other thing um that we've found

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,240
is really helpful

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
when building open source software into

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,080
our strategies um and i talked about

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
this i alluded to this earlier

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,919
is is giving a lot of autonomy so we

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
give autonomy to the developers

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
um they can decide what open source

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
software they want to try out and

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,520
explore

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,799
and they're free to download it and

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,640
we'll talk about our open source

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,600
software policy is completely documented

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
and online for

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
anyone to see so if they have a question

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,480
about is it okay for me to do this

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,039
um they can go read the the policy and

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,640
see

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,400
if it's not clear there we work really

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,240
hard to make it clear but if it's not

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,799
they can ask the open source champs

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,760
or they can drop us a an email a chat or

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,840
an email

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,919
we also give autonomy to the different

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,559
business units which i also talked about

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,799
um so

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,320
the windows office team can can figure

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,480
out what makes sense for them

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,919
the xbox team can figure out what how

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
open source software fits into their

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,600
world

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,520
what makes sense to them because the

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,640
gaming industry is probably

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
very different than the office

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,440
productivity team um

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
the developer tools team develops their

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,400
own

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
strategy and policy um so each each

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,679
business unit

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,440
has autonomy to decide how open source

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,840
software fits into their strategy

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
and each developer has autonomy to

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,400
decide

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,559
which open source software is useful to

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,440
them as they develop the software

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,440
as they do their jobs

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,640
so i said we we have an open source

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
software policy at microsoft

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
our goal is to make it really easy to

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
understand and available to everybody

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,400
i'm not showing you our internal

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,120
documentation but we have

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,240
summarized and shared much of our policy

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
on our website

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,480
so if you go to opensource.microsoft.com

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
and you go under our program um you can

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
see an overview of some of the tools

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
we're using and then

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
on the top right there you see using

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,120
open source contributing releasing

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
projects

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,039
and we actually talk about what our

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,600
policies are what the review processes

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,960
look like

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,720
if we're going to use open source

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,200
software contribute to it

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,440
or or release our own software as open

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,440
source

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
cool if anyone has questions feel free

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
to to jump in

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,159
or things that you want to you want to

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,159
share

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
another thing that that we've done is

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,120
make sure that we're learning from

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,640
others and sharing what we learned

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,159
so talks like this i'm hoping it's 2a so

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,440
i shared a bunch of stuff and hopefully

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,039
you also share

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,120
on best practices of things we might not

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
have thought of um one of the places

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,640
where we share

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
a lot of open source programs office

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
type

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
information like review process and

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,320
compliance um is that the to do group

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
to-do group is a group of linux

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,360
foundation member companies

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,720
um that all most everyone in the to-do

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
group actually runs an open source

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
programs office

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,600
um in the companies they represent are

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,799
across the board there's

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,919
software companies um there's banks

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,039
there's um media companies there's all

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,200
sorts of companies

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,960
that get together and we share what we

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
do in our companies what questions we

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,080
have

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
what things we've seen in the industry

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,200
we actually write white papers um and

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,480
share those so there's a lot of

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
information there and a lot of

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,679
camaraderie um and in a normal year we

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
also

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,000
meet personal at events like all things

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,279
open um several of those people are

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,960
actually speaking

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
in other talks during this this

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,320
conference

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,399
um they also share best practices so

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,399
fast fund is one um that dwayne o'brien

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,360
from indeed he runs indeed's open source

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
programs office

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,480
um he came up with the idea called fast

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
fund i'm just giving that as an example

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,440
because there's many others

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,640
um but he came up with um

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,760
an idea that a company could earmark or

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,360
dedicate

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,840
uh 120 000 a year and then every month

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
we

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,399
microsoft for example gives 10 000 to an

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,120
open source software project and

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,399
the the key is to identify which project

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,000
is going to get the money

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,760
we ask our developers who are

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,919
contributing to open source software

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
to nominate and vote on the projects so

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,640
the ten thousand dollars goes to some

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,279
project

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,960
that microsoft employees have said this

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,159
project is important like i work in open

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
source software and

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,360
this project is important to microsoft

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,960
is important to me

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,799
and could really use ten thousand

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,600
dollars to send developers to

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,440
conferences

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,039
or um to buy a new computer system or

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,960
to hire a part-time assignment whatever

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,919
whatever it is they would like to do

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,880
um so ideas like that also come out of

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
that group

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,000
um and then um there's a lot of

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
foundations that were part of you

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
probably

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
heard of a lot of them but foundations

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,039
are a great way

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,559
a great way to do a number of things um

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,799
so foundations allow

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,640
us to meet and talk to other people that

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,320
contribute to the project

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,320
which is really important and they often

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,559
have annual events you know apache con

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,559
is where apache group gets together

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,919
linux has several events um there are

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,159
ways for us to meet

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,559
and talk to people there are also ways

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,080
to clarify how

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,679
how the governance and working together

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,360
of those projects happen

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,120
it's a way for us to financially support

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
the projects um it's often it's

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,039
easy to not easy but it's easier to sign

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
up for a subscription and say you know

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,240
this is membership

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,360
um for the linux foundation than it

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
would be to like

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,600
go around and hold out our hands and ask

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
for five thousand dollars for this and a

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,440
thousand dollars for this it's easier to

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,000
like

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,919
join a membership and it's a way for

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
companies to very clearly clarify how

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,880
they they work together

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,640
and it's a way to support efforts like

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,120
marketing efforts or events

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,200
or things that might not be easily done

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,440
within the the project's technical

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
infrastructure um so foundations are

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,080
really important and one of the ways

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,200
that we

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,720
contribute back and get to participate

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,559
so there's a question from the audience

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,919
on how do you make sure that competitive

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,320
secret ip

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,000
is not accidentally open sourced or that

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
your patents are not granted via open

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,080
source licenses that include a patent

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,039
grid

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,600
um so we do if we open source something

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,240
we do

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,080
do a lot of review on it um some things

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,720
that we have been asked to open source

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,320
um microsoft money for example everyone

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,960
would like us to open source microsoft

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,039
money

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,559
um they're often were developed with

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,159
other companies ip

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,320
or i don't know about microsoft money in

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,640
particular but they have other companies

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,880
ip or we develop them in partnership

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,679
um and we can't it just would take a ton

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,000
of time

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
to go back and verify that all the

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
intellectual property was okay for us to

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,640
open source

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,000
um and especially in something that we

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,919
don't know if there'll be a community

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,080
it's not a product we ship anymore

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,360
um so sometimes we always do a lot of

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
research and so that's part of the

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
decision on whether or not we open

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,960
source something

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
um so like when we open source fluid

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,000
framework we did a lot of you know we

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,840
analyzed all the code and made sure

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,919
that it was all ours and that we could

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,480
license it under the license we picked

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,320
um on the patent side same thing would

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,080
happen there'd be a review

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,080
but but microsoft is actually part of

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,039
the the open

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,159
oin open innovation network um we have

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,320
patent agreements

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,600
um that supports linux and open source

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,640
software so i encourage you to go out

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,880
and look at that

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,000
microsoft is one of the supporting

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,559
members of that

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,840
um and in a way it makes parts of our

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,760
patent portfolio

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,799
available to support open source

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,799
software in linux

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,120
and then i just have a last um lesson to

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
share

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
hopefully you saw seven lessons there

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,360
maybe you saw eight

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,080
maybe you saw more um i'm gonna ask you

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,919
about that

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,679
um but one of one of the things that i

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,120
think we found is really important and i

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,240
alluded to it when i said we worked with

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,039
hr

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,080
but that's making sure that we are

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,600
rewarding

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,440
our employees for working and open

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,440
source software especially when you're

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,960
at a company that doesn't traditionally

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,880
have a lot of open source software

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
contribution culture it's important to

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
make sure that

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,919
you're doing things that make your

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,320
culture more open source friendly

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,760
so during the evals that we do we ask

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,360
have you built on the work of others

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,519
have you contributed to others work

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,559
that's very open source friendly

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,880
open source is officially recognized and

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
documented in the developer skill set

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,399
and there's training available to all

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,919
developers on how to use

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,919
github or how to build open source

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,519
software communities um we've also built

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,960
the open source champs to help answer

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,840
those questions

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,960
um we're doing a lot of work to try to

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,159
make sure

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,760
that we are rewarding um people using

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
open source software

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,519
in their in their day-to-day work um and

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,320
in their strategies and i think

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,360
if you don't do this piece no matter how

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,360
good you say it is

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,720
um people are going to continue doing

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
what they're what they're motivated to

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,679
do

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,960
and what they get rewarded to do um what

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,000
their managers say

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,760
great job for what they get a bonus for

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,200
um so we're trying to make sure very

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,640
consciously make sure that we're

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,640
rewarding open source software because

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,159
it's good for both our employees

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,679
and for the community and for our

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,760
customers um

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,960
it didn't share at the beginning that

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,440
microsoft's mission

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,600
is to enable individuals and

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,279
organizations to achieve more

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,279
and i think open source software fits so

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,240
well in that so the open source programs

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,080
office mission

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,679
is to enable individuals and

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,600
organizations to achieve

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,600
more through open source software

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,080
because that is definitely a tool

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,600
um that can be easily used to help

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,799
people achieve more in the world

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,120
and we're all building on the work of

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,440
others

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,320
so that is what i had for for

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,640
presentation

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,159
and for lessons learned at microsoft

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,000
that i wanted to share with you

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,039
i am curious um for those of you in the

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
audience

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,399
what lesson have you what did you get

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
out of this presentation or what lesson

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,520
have you learned

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,040
um in your company or in your work in

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
open source or what questions do you

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,520
have for me

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,119
so we have 10 minutes for q a i'm not

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
going to keep talking for 10 more

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,040
minutes so

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:34,079
one of you has to ask a question

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:35,839
or share something

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,520
i would normally pick on somebody but

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,520
it's a little hard um this way

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,599
well there's no questions um that is my

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,480
twitter id there storming

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,480
so you can go to twitter.comstorming

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,639
you're welcome to ask me questions there

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,760
um you're welcome to share with me

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,200
anything

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,359
that you've learned if you want to

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,040
talk now you can just raise your hand

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,160
and we'll turn on your microphone so if

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,079
people want to chat

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,119
we can do that and i will stay here

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
if anyone wants to talk

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,839
thanks heather thanks aaron

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,480
all right we got one q a and the q a

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,000
tool so the question is what's one thing

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
you want to change about microsoft's

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,160
open source program from next year

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,240
um so what i found that since i've been

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
at microsoft is is microsoft has a

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,280
really strong culture

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,960
of code ownership um so when someone at

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,359
microsoft

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,280
writes a tool just just for internal use

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,960
and other teams start using it

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,640
they support that tool for them so there

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,000
could be like 20 teams across microsoft

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,960
that use this really useful tool

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
tool and that person um part time of

00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,599
their job

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
will take it on themselves to support it

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
and the other teams

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,040
if they find a problem will look like if

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,160
i wrote it will look to me

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,839
to fix it and they won't um

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
fix it themselves because that would be

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,000
stepping on my toes like why would you

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,200
mess with

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
my code so i would love to continue to

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
explore

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,440
how we change that in the inner source

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,000
model and the open source model that

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,480
helping others build better things um

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,119
doesn't

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,520
infringe on ownership and responsibility

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,960
because

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,800
the ownership thing is really awesome

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,920
from like i feel responsible for my code

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,599
and i maintain it

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,079
so how can we expand that so for the

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,920
next year that's what i'm focused on

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
the next question is so thanks for the

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,280
question um the next question is what is

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
the chance that windows will have a

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,800
linux kernel

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
i could not speak to that like i said

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
all of the business

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,599
units at microsoft make their own open

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,599
source strategies i

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,839
i haven't heard that but you'd have to

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,839
ask somebody from the windows group

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,240
cool any other questions or comments

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,240
so heather says she's thankful to think

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,760
about how to build open source and

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
humanitarian action by learning what

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,280
ospos do

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,359
that and and the other humanitarian

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,960
cause that i think is really interesting

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,119
um if you haven't heard of it and we

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
should go research hvas humanitarian

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
free and open source software

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,720
and i first met them i don't know

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,119
probably about 10 years ago

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,480
at grace hopper and they were there

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,760
talking about the secret that they had

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,359
discovered

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
these two professors had decided that

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,240
they wanted to encourage more students

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
to join their computer science

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,040
department

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,800
and so over the summer they invited

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,480
students at their university to come

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,240
work on humanitarian

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,839
open source software projects for

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,599
example they worked on sahana which is

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
like the disaster recovery software

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,839
helps you track

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,560
on what you do in a disaster recovery

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,400
situation and

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
they were really surprised their first

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,359
day of class like

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
half the class was women which just

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,400
really doesn't happen in like entry

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,000
computer science classes

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,599
very often anymore um so they discovered

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,640
that they were more likely to attract

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,880
women

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,880
to computer science classes if the cause

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,960
was a humanitarian cause

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,640
um than if it was just a make something

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,320
run faster cause

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,920
so it's been it's been a movement to try

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,480
to see how we can incorporate that

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,480
to improve diversity across projects

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,119
any other questions or comments anyone

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,119
has

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,839
i can see a whole bunch of you still

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,599
hanging out so i'm going to i'm going to

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,079
hang out so if you want to chat oh i

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,839
do got a question um how does microsoft

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,800
think about foundation sponsorships and

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,800
memberships

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,040
given how large the organization is um

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,079
so if the foundation sponsorship or

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,520
membership is is

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,560
really particular to one group um that

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,839
group decides

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,359
and joins so if it was like um

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,280
you know gaming i'm not a gamer but if

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,640
it was something very specific to like

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
the xbox

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
world and it was a gaming project or

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,760
foundation they they would decide

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,960
and they would come up with it from

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,520
their budget some of them obviously span

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,280
many groups across microsoft for example

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,960
like the linux foundation membership

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,480
has so many different subgroups and so

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,000
many projects part of it

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,760
that we decide that at the open source

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,440
programs office level

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,440
and we pull money from the different

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,000
groups for that

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,040
and what we do is we actually have a

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,040
open decision

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,280
framework i'm gonna you wouldn't know

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,400
the word but we we have like a document

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,920
um where we have whoever decided it was

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,560
a good idea to join the foundation like

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
they're like

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,680
you know i think this one's important

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,000
and we should be supporting it they fill

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,000
out this document and they say

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,520
what the name of the foundation is and

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,359
all the info about it

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,040
what membership looks like who in

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,560
microsoft will help make sure that we

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,079
participate in

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,839
in a good fashion like it's not just

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,760
about money it's about you know

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,920
attending the meetings and contributing

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,680
and being a good foundation member

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,599
so they'll fill all that out and then we

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,480
send it around to the executives and to

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,319
other people

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,680
um so everybody has a chance to take a

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,560
look at it and say

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,520
awesome or have you thought about this

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,480
and then we'll

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,480
fund it centrally

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,800
it was an anonymous attendee that

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,319
submitted the question but if it didn't

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,720
answer your question feel free to type

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:26,720
another one

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,560
any other questions or comments or

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,079
things you learned

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,079
i'm not trying to follow twitter because

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,599
like that would be too much to talk and

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,960
read and follow twitter but hopefully

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,839
you're sharing things you learned there

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,839
as well

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,960
what's the most important thing you

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,400
learned about open source software

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
when dealing with companies or

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,839
interested companies you can just drop

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,839
it and chat

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,400
so we have a question if you have a

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,000
product manager who's suspicious

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
regarding open source

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,280
what is your best argument to convince

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,480
her or him

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,480
um i think the key

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,079
to talking to people who are skeptical

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,839
about open source software

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,680
is obviously and you've probably thought

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,119
of this to figure out

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,400
um what why like what what are they

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,200
suspicious of

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,119
um for example i worked the previous job

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,400
um i worked with a salesperson

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,119
who was just really baffled about why

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,079
people would work in their free time on

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,520
software

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,520
and i eventually told him i thought he

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,440
was missing two pieces

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,400
one he was missing how much fun it is to

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,720
write software so i i tried to

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
make analogies to writing software to

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,839
hobbies that he might have you know how

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
it's about solving problems and you know

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,599
making puzzles or creating arts

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,359
you know part of it is just like it's a

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,119
fun way to solve a problem

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,480
and then i talked about the problems

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,240
that they were solving like why they

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,079
were willing to give up their free time

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,240
you know people volunteer for all sorts

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,800
of causes like building houses or

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,319
um helping out nursing homes and so i

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
tried to equate like the problems they

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,200
were solving

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,720
that's how they volunteered their time

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
in his particular case it wasn't about

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,800
like

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,480
why open source it was like why do

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,960
people do this for free

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,560
um so i think that the key is is getting

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
to know them well enough to understand

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,040
like what it is they're skeptical of or

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,640
what it is that they're

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,040
afraid of anybody else have

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,400
have any suggestions or or ways that

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,280
they would deal with a suspicious

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,040
product manager

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,359
or product manager suspicious of open

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,359
source

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,119
so one of the comments says you guys can

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,319
probably read this or you all can

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,760
probably read this

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,440
often people who don't understand open

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,960
source are very concerned about security

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,560
if you can see all the code how could it

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,760
be secure and

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,520
i actually think there's a lot of good

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640
work they if that's the case you could

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
point them out now

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,079
um like a lot of people working on the

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,760
secure supply chain and authenticating

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,839
where it came from and

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,359
you know being able to verify that it is

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,560
what they created

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,640
there's even work on on helping

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:12,160
understand who worked on a project

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,520
there's a lot of good work there any

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,800
other suggestions for

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,560
for huger or for any other questions

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,000
or any other things you learned i see

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,000
heather said she learned that

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,839
has learned um to be tenacious and do

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,839
your homework

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,920
so i do think we're actually at time now

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,520
um you know how to find me if you want

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,960
to come chat or you want to ask a

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,200
question or you want to share anything

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,240
um it was great to talk to you all and i

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:48,880
hope you have an

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:48,880
