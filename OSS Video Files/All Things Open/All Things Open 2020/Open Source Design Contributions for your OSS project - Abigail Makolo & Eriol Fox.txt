Title: Open Source Design Contributions for your OSS project - Abigail Makolo & Eriol Fox
Publication date: 2020-10-29
Playlist: All Things Open 2020
Description: 
	Presented by: Abigail Makolo & Eriol Fox, Open Food Network & Open Source Design
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Extended Sessions Tracks

Abstract: In 2019 we started a project called 'Open Design', a collaboration between Adobe, Designit and Ushahidi. Together we looked at increasing and sustaining design contribution to open source and advocating for OSS in design, and design in OSS. Open Design is now led by volunteers as an open source project.

This session is aimed at getting OSS projects ready for design contributions. Covering the best first issues for design contributions and the processes involved in building a ‘design wing’ of your OSS community. We’ll briefly cover the history of the project and the main problems we attempted to solve and we’ll present the learning and adaptions to our workshop framework and methodology that aims to engage design teams and individuals that are not yet ‘on-board’ with OSS as an ethos or movement.

We'll cover deeper motivations for design professionals to contribute to OSS and also some practical tips on structuring issues, labelling and maintaining design (and some extended functions like research, UX and product management) you’ll leave with a set of tools and methods you can apply to your OSS to engage with designers.

hi everyone

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,040
uh i am first going to ask

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,160
ben to um oh no wait i've got access to

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
all the attendees

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,440
uh i'm first going to put a bitly link

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
in the zoom chat

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,240
uh this is to what you hopefully can see

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,359
on your screen at the moment which is

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,920
how we're presenting our slides today uh

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,920
using something called a mirror board um

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,040
you may or may not heard of that

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
um but this is how we'll be doing a lot

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
of our

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
workshop activities and how we'll be

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,879
delivering the content and it's also

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,000
accessible

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,559
um throughout the workshop uh talk

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
and also afterwards as well so it's a

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,160
nice way to

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
uh have all of the content um throughout

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
throughout the time that you might need

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,760
it we have locked a lot of things so

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,280
there's a function to lock

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,039
a lot of the content so don't worry too

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,480
much if you're clicking around

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,080
um and you know there's no

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,360
chance that you could accidentally move

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,200
something or accidentally delete

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
something or it's very unlikely we've

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
also got a backup so don't worry

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
um but one of the things that you will

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,360
be able to do

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,560
um is you will be able to add text

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,600
and you will be able to edit some text

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,960
so we would ask you as per usual

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
to um abide by the code of conduct that

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
all things open has

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
and make sure that you're being

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
respectful and that you're being

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
um you know kind and considerate with

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
the language that you use and that

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
you're not

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,159
doing anything untoward on our mirror

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,159
board

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,560

with you um

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
this is the open source design

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,560
contributions for your open source

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,840
project um i've dropped the link

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,520
to this mirror board in the chat but as

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,399
more and more people come in to the zoom

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
if i could maybe ask ben to just kind of

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,720
every so often just drop the bitly link

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
in the chat just so that everyone's got

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
access to it when they join because i

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,959
know that you don't see the zoom

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160

um people on the

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,959
mirror board when we start doing uh

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,120
activities as well

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,120

people to come in

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,640

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,560
i have been doing design for

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,320
around 10 years now i actually don't

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
remember exactly how many years

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,720
but around 10 years in digital product

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,840
design and user experience

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,160
i started out in

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
and for-profit companies before uh

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
transitioning

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,040
into the humanitarian sector and the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
open source sector around about three to

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
four years ago

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,919
um so i haven't been in open source for

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
very long but the time that i've spent

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,800
in open source has been

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,490
very uh intense

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
and very um

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,800
[Music]

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,199
feels like i've crammed 10 years into a

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,880
few years which is a good thing i think

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,800
um i now work at the an organization

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
uh as their designer there um they are

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,639
uh platform for small food supply chains

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
and supporting producers globally so

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,960
newcastle university where i look into

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
and research how designers are

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
involving themselves in open source

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,240
projects with a for good or

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,880

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,000
actually it's a cool name i got from

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,800
the pier and i have about over three

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,880
years

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
of combined experience in technology i

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,120
stay combined because

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
i've been doing quite a lot of things

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
from

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,160
design to software development in

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,160
c sharp and yeah just it consulting

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
but in product design and user

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,080
experience i have

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
two years of experience and counting and

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,919
um

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,000
i was a google coding mentor for the

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,759
animated work community which is an open

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
source community that encourages you

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,880
know

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
contributions to open source from people

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,479
with

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
any skill level or background

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,479
and it was really interesting because

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
that was the very first point of entry i

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,160
had into open source

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,680
and it was just so welcoming i found it

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
welcoming not a lot of people do

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
but it was really encouraging that i was

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
able to

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
break in like that and since then i have

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
been actively

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,759
advocating for you know more designers

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,759
more resource more design contributions

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,840
educating people on how they can go

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,759
about educating designers

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,919
specifically on how they can go about

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
making their open source contribution

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
i'm currently a product design

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,440
consultant at athlete

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
um a really cool food-centered

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,800
initiative and

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,039
yeah that's that's about me cool

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
so we're really thrilled to actually one

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,319
be uh

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,639
helping you continue your open source

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
and design journey or start your open

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,520
source and design journey

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,599
and i am also really really thrilled to

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
be doing this with abby i saw

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
abby speak at open source community

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,639
africa this year and i was

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,520
uh so eager to do something with them

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,400
with her um that i was so glad that all

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,960
housekeeping

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,000
um so the tools that we'll be using

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,840

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
tools um it's going to be the regular

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
zoom we were hoping to use zoom

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
breakouts but because we haven't got

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
access to zoom breakout rooms

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,039
uh because of the format of um all

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,200
things open zoom

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
we'll actually be using jitsi rooms for

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
the breakout activities that we have

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
planned

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,000
and we're also using a tool which uh the

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,040
link in the chat

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
um should be uh available throughout the

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
session for you to

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,680
to click on it should open up in a

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,920
browser you don't need a

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,959
login to access it it should be all open

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,800
access

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
but it's called miro and it's what you

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
should be seeing on the screen at the

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
moment

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,040
it's where we've got our slides it's

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,720
also where we've got various notes

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
and all the different activities that we

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,680
have planned for the next uh

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,600
two and three quarter hours so you can

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
also find the

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
link on the screen at the moment

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
although don't

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,200
use that one it needs a dash in it

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,480
uh use the one in the chat um the other

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
thing that we might be using

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,680
it depends on how your different groups

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
are investigating the different um

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
activities that we have planned but you

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,320
might want to use github or gitlab to

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
share and investigate different open

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,279
source projects and

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
the issues um that we'll be talking

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,800
about so you might want to share links

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,519
to your projects when we start talking

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,200
about

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,920
design in the open source projects

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
we'll uh i'll introduce really quickly

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
how we're going to do the breakout rooms

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,760
so um we're going to be using jitsi

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
which is a

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,160
video service which is free and again

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
you don't need anything

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,680
to log into it so you should just be

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,839
able to use a link

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,120
and what i've done is i've very very

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
quickly put together

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,480
a new section on our mirror board which

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,519
is actually up in the top

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,839
top left hand corner and what i can do

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
is one of the magic things that i can do

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
in

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,079
the mirror is i can bring everyone to me

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
so that everyone that's currently on

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,920
this link has

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
access to this section but what i'd

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
really like

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,959
folks to do is if you intend on actively

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
participating

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
in the group activities where you'll

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,399
head to gypsy rooms to discuss

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,440
design related topics on open source if

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
you could please

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
spend a bit of time just adding your

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,440
name into

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
one of the groups and this will make

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
sure that you

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,839
have a room to go to and people to talk

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
about these um

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,760
these activities uh with so all you need

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,120
to do to be able to add your name into

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,320
a group is just click on the

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,519
um sort of fake virtual post-it note

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
that we have here

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
and if you double-click you should be

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,079
able to edit the text and you can

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:17,440
type in your name here and then um

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,240
you'll be assigned to that group number

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,320
one

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
the link underneath it will be your

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,839
gypsy room link

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
when you click on this link this will

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
open and i'll just show you what the

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
jitsi room

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,000
looks like just in case you haven't used

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,079
it see before you

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,160
get um a screen that asks you to

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,360
um for your kind of microphone or camera

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,959
access you don't need to give this

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
digits you don't have to just like with

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,839
zoom you don't have to

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,279
you can pop in your name and then you

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
can join the meeting

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,920
and essentially you get then access to a

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
video room that only people with this

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,320
link

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,040
will be able to enter please let us know

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
in the zoom chat if there are any

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
problems with this

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,480
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,200
try and work through this as best we can

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,880
um and troubleshoot any problems that we

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,880
might uh come across

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
um but you should then be able to unmute

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
yourself and

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,519
also use a chat function to talk about

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
the different activities with the group

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
the groups that you join

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,079
what else is important about knowing

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,440
jetsea out so the other really important

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
thing is because we're using two

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,760
different services

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,320
for um video audio

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
chat we're using the zoom to present the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,959
content

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,959
and we're asking you to enter jitsi

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,240
rooms to have discussions

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,560
sometimes if you're not using headphones

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
and you're listening to me speak out on

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,880
uh your speakers

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
um on your your computer

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,639
what can happen is if i'm speaking on

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
the zoom at the same time you open a

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,160
jitsi room

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,240
and you're not muted in the jitsi room

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
you can get that weird echo that happens

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,000
and it's

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,079
really oh not very pleasant to to hear

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,360
it's like a tinny echo

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,760
so you can stop that happening by muting

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
your uh audio just down here on the

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
gypsy room

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,240
before you enter and that way the audio

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
that i'm

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,920
putting through the zoom won't go

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,279
through the jitsi

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,800
audio as well you can let people know

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
when you're in the gypsy room

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,040
by using the chat you can just say hey

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,200
and then at one at some point i will

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
mute myself and we will mute ourselves

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
in the zoom room

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200
so that you can have your conversations

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,760
in the jitsi room for the allotted time

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
of the activity

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
so we'll we'll we'll work our way

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
through it we'll we'll experiment and

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,480
we'll see how it goes

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
um again do let us know if there's any

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
problems

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
so also amazing to see some folks

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,680
putting down their their names um

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,880
if you want to find the um section where

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,000
you can write down your name on the

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,639
mirror board

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you can uh toggle or untoggle this

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
little map at the bottom right hand

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
corner which gives you the whole view of

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
where things are

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
and you can move around this little

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,600
square to find where you need to be

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
so if you wanted to come back to our

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,279
slides you can see them all here

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
and the activities and then you can

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
always move back here

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
to take the map away again you click on

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
the little map icon

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,519
and it minimizes so that you can have an

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,800
uncluttered view

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,600
of the mirror part so

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,440
um just to kind of go back to some more

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,880
housekeeping

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
um for today's agenda um the first thing

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,920
that i'm gonna

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,959
say just before we go through today's

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
agendas for the

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,480
new folks that might have joined um is

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,720
we

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,079
have uh somebody else that's helping us

to help anybody that might be struggling

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,680
with miro so if you're finding it hard

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
to

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,600
type down text or if you're finding it

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
hard in your gypsy rooms um

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440

so

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,199
with um most of the housekeeping done

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
and the unknown housekeeping with the

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,959
gypsy rooms

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,800
there's always a surprise with the

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,000
workshops and talks um

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,279
just a little bit about the agenda so uh

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
we're going to do

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
a really short introduction to open

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,279
source design

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,279
from a very limited perspective just two

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,880
different perspectives from myself and

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
abby we're going to talk a little bit

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,440
about why you should care about

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,959
design then we've got an activity which

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,360
is a group activity

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
so that will be in your gypsy rooms

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
where you

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
talk about welcoming designers to your

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
open source software

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
um and we'll go through the activity

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
when we get to it so don't worry about

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,639
that

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,560
we then have um a section about open

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,800
source design documentation

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,240
which is a solo activity where we go

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,680
through the questions

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
you have a think to yourself you might

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
want to use pen and paper you might want

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,880
to use your own notepad docs however you

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,519
want to respond to

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
this solo activity is up to you but it's

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
so that you can take that little break

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,880
from conversation

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
and think about documentation so we'll

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
present some information

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,480
you can have a think um and then we've

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,040
got our uh

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
last section and last activity which is

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
about good

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,920
first design issues and the group

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
activity we won't spoil it too much

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,959
unless you start

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
sort of traveling around on the mirror

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,320
board and you you get spoilers

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,560
um but we'll be doing that again in the

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,440
breakout room so groups of around five

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
different people

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
will get you in a room together and

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
you'll be able to work on this

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,079
good first design issue yourself

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,800
we will try and make time for a q a

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,120
afterwards

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,839
uh we've planned in time for a q a but

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
hopefully

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,160
we should still get time for that and

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,880
also just be aware at this point

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
if especially if you've recently joined

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,279
that the two group activities

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
are really best done in conversation

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,399
with others

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
you don't have to use your microphone

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,160
you don't have to use your video

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
but what you can use the chat function

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,919
and type out in the in the gypsy rooms

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,039
when you're in your breakout rooms

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,360
but it is best done in

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,439
active participation with each other so

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,720
we really do encourage you

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,400
to be here and present and ready to have

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,880
conversations about the material that

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,799
you're gonna listen to

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,919
um that being said we know that there's

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,640
probably a lot of people

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
that are wanting to stick around here

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
and

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,320
just listen in and not be active

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,559
participants you are absolutely

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,080
also welcome to sit in there just might

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,240
be sections where

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
there's about 20 minutes or so of

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
silence in the main zoom room

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,160
while other people are out in their

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,240
gypsy room breakouts having

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,760
hopefully what we're hoping is going to

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,039
be pretty awesome conversations about

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
open source design

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,120
um and that just might get a bit um

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
boring for you so at that point you

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,679
might just want to

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,679
take a break you might want to um

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
join a gypsy room and listen in and just

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,600
say hey folks i'm listening in

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
but we really do again encourage your

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
active participation this kind of work

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,080
is best done

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:14,080
as a group groups activity

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,320
at that point i'm just going to

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,840
remove my cat from the room since he's

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,840
making a lot of noise

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,919
again sorry um

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,799
so that's what we have planned um abby

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
is there anything

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,799
that i might have missed that you can

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,919
remember

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,520
i think everything pretty well um just

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,200
looking forward to engaging with

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,160
everyone yeah yeah cool

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,600
so i love i actually kind of love it

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
when things like that happen in these

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,720
remote like conferences and these remote

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
like workshops it's like

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
of course like people's cats will be

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,480
making noises and people's dogs and

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
kids and all these kinds of things so

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,640
it's the wonders of

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,640
uh real life right um so

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,360
so to jump into the intros and some of

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,679
the um

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,039
uh background information on open source

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
design that we want to um

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,440
offer to you today this information it's

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
based off of our experiences as

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
designers

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
who have worked for foster organizations

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,240
or contributed to foss

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,400
as contributors or it

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,080
also could be information given on good

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,760
faith from other designers from the open

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,720
source community that we've integrated

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,320
into the content that we've got here

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,039
our knowledge of some of the deeper

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:43,919
history of how design

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:46,960
connects to open source or fuss

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,640
is maybe not what

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
we're kind of here to do we're here to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,600
give you some of our experiences and

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
kind of work

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
take you through some of them the things

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,799
that we think

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,159
work best with open source design um

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,159
needs um but that is

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
basically what i'm trying to say is that

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
there is a whole heap of history um

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,480
which is likely rooted in some of the

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,679
early days of open source

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,679
um that we may be missing out so please

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,679
um please uh forgive us if we

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,600
have missed out a vital detail about you

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,960
know usability really early on in

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,280
in open source uh history um

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
we are mostly speaking from our own

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
experience and the things that we've

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,080
tried and tested

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,760
um so yeah

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,320
so i'm going to do a really quick

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
introduction

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,679
second cat needed letting out um so i'm

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,520
going to do a really quick

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:51,360
introduction to opensourcedesign.net

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,200
so um typically once a designer

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,679
is curious and this is definitely me

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,880
this was my experience when i started to

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,280
work in the open source space

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
i i started to get really curious about

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,400
how to

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
be be more engaged as a designer within

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
the open source space

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,760
and one of the first things that i

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,960
stumbled across was opensourcedesign.net

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,320
and opensourcedesign.net is a community

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
of designers in

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,400
open source or that are interested in

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
open source kind of basically the

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,159
intersection of design and open source

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,520
is where

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,679
is in this space of opensourcedesign.net

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,559
is where we typically meet

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,559
and it was originally started by a few

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,360
designers that have been

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,320
involved in open source work for a

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,159
number of years

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
started a twitter thread wanting to meet

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,200
other designers that also

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,520
work on open source or are interested in

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,559
open source and that led to the creation

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,480
of opensourcedesign.net

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
so i'm not going to go into the deeper

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,400
history of

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,280
the reasons about why

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,960
opensourcedesign.net was

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,960
founded and created but what i really

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,000
want to do is give an overview of some

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,039
of the things that

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,240
opensourcedesign.net the community

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,480
that exists there does so

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,400
one of the things that

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,080
opensourcedesign.net has is a job board

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,840
and i say job in inverted commas because

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,039
it's a board where any open source

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,159
uh community any open source project any

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,679
open source tool

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,559
can post a thing that they need from

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,240
designers or maybe a a

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,640
project that they want to engage a

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,520
designer on on this job board

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
either that that could be paid if it's

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,280
got some budget attached

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
to it or it can be uh gratis so it can

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
be something that you're looking for

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,880
open source

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,039
design contributions for so the

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,760
opensourcedesign.net

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,760
uh community maintained this and run

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,360
this jobs board as it were

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
and the reason that we have a jobs board

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,600
as opposed to

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,159
maybe a list of issues is because like

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
myself

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
as a designer first coming into the open

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
source space

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,880
i really didn't quite know how to find

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,640
issues that i could work on beyond the

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,400
open source that i was

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,679
working on and initially um hired to

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,520
to to be doing uh work on so

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,360
i found this job board and this job

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
board serves a purpose to introduce

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,640
designers that are not familiar with the

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
kinds of processes the kind of inherent

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
community that open source has on the

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,159
existing platforms that it has

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,000
so the job board serves a really

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,520
important purpose in in that respect

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,120
it's a familiar

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,760
and uh typical sort of ui for people

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,360
designers to engage with open source

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,440
tasks

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,440
open source design they write articles

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,559
or they repost articles about design in

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
open source

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,559
we have a monthly community call and a

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,159
support forum where we talk about all

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,880
manner of different things and

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
and from talks that we might have

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,400
planned to

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
workshops that we want to offer to other

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,840
designers to

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,840
generally like complicated topics about

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,960
version control in design and things

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,880
like that so you'll find lots of

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
different discussion there

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,400
we tend to have a presence at various

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,400
different conferences

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,760
one of them typically is fosten so we

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
usually have a dev room at fosten

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
where we taking the conference talks

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,000
from different designers or different

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,159
people that

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,320
want to give a design related talk and

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
we also do something called ux clinics

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,000
so we go to different conferences and we

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,720
do something called

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,080
a 15 minute user experience clinic where

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,559
open source projects can come and talk

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,480
about

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
a problem that they've got and get 15

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,760
minutes with a ux designer

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,679
there is um various other design

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,880
community outreach and conferences

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,960
including um the design perspective so

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,159
this one so we do it from the open

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
source perspective

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,640
but we also do it from the design

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
perspective and this is a really

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,240
critical part

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,760
of what we do that's very new actually

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,720
so going out into those design

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,679
conferences

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,000
so the conferences that are specifically

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,200
for

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,200
types of designers that where they will

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,279
likely have never heard about open

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,480
source software or if they have

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,880
it definitely doesn't have a prominent

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,240
prominent um existence in those kinds of

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
conferences and we go there and do

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,000
advocacy work for open source

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,600
at those design design related spaces

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,039
and we also do partnerships on different

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,720
projects

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,279
it's an open community so anyone can

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
join um there's no criteria to join and

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,000
there's

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,159
there's no specific hierarchy the open

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,840
source design.net community is very very

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,600
uh open to everyone of all different

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,799
skill levels both design

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,080
and open source to take you through kind

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,440
of a little bit what the jobs board

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,039
looks like just because it might be the

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
thing that you're most curious about

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,080
it looks a little bit like this when

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,279
designers land on it so there's the

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,360
different information

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,480
um that people can uh open source

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,960
projects or

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,120
uh open source uh maintainers or

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
contributors can pop up there

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,880
and there's just general information

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
about what is being asked for whether

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
it's going to be paid

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,080
and where they can find out more

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,440
information and the other side of it

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,640
is the form that open source maintainers

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
fill in to

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,080
submit the job so there's a few

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,120
different criteria that we have when you

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
want to submit a job

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,320
the main thing is that you need to be

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,520
able to

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,279
prove uh that your project that you're

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,200
submitting is an open source project

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
because one of the things that we do not

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
want to encourage is designers working

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
on

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,400
non-open source related projects through

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
the open source jobs board

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,240
and then there is in the community forum

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,600
um this is just an example of a most

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
recent one which is a

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,520
logo for a podcast uh open source

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
podcast that's um coming up

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,960
a number of different designers have

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
some ideas on logos for that podcast and

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,440
this is kind of the

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,240
the way that we do some of the issue

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
tracking

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,720
and collaboration that is a little bit

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
harder for designers to do because we

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,600
don't

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,400
necessarily have tools that do things

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,440
like

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,880
pull requests and um we can't

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,000
uh branch uh other people's design files

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
particularly well

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,520
or effectively or um

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,200
cost-effectively as well so this is how

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,360
we've managed to do it through the forum

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,720
threads

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,880
so that was a really quick overview of

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,159
opensourcedesign.net

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,320
as far as introduction abby over to you

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,120
on google summer of code and outreachy

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
okay yes so besides open source

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
design.net

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
it's also really interesting to find out

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,000
that you know for designers looking to

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,799
make design contributions to

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,880
open source projects and for open source

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,640
looking for design contributions

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,640
these open source programs and

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,120
internships are really a good

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
means to you know communicate with each

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,960
other and

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,320
interact so um outreachy and google

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
summer of code

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,440
it's it's really interesting to see that

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
they're encouraging more and more design

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,480
contributions to foster

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,679
these days so um

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,480
so we'll start with google summer code

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,200
um it's a global open source program

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,919
that is

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,360
trying trying to encourage you know more

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,360
university students to

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,679
contribute to open source software and

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,039
so here you would see students making

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,559
proposals about

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,960
the kind of contributions they want to

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,200
make and i took some time to actually go

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,520
through some of those

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,720
proposals in the archives and i noticed

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
that you know there were

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,360
quite a lot of design contribution um

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,520
design proposals that were

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,640
eventually approved by these

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,799
organizations like the gnome project

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
zeus and so many other interesting

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,240
projects and it was nice to see

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,559
you know the final output of these

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,799
design conjugations and it's just great

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,399
when designers can work with other

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,480
members of you know open

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760
open source teams to improve the

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,559
usability usually

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,720
these projects usually ask for improved

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,120
usability or user experience

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,679
or user interface and it's just nice to

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,840
see that that can actually be done

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,240
on these open source programs and then

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,120
outreaching

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,799
is it's quite similar to google summer

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,360
of code but it's a three-month

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
paid internship program and it's trying

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,039
to support diversity

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,399
in um free and open source software

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
development so

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,760
uh this is a program that is really

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,039
interesting to me because

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,320
i participated in it as an applicant um

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,000
earlier this year

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
and i noticed that there are so many

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,039
organizations

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,760
looking and calling for design

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,360
contributions like the gnome foundation

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,399
mozilla which i got to work with

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,120
personally

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,960
there was fedora the opia foundation the

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,840
humanitarian releasing team

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,279
and into my their projects were just so

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,159
interesting to see

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,120
um and it just showed a lot of detail

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
like they actually

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,399
knew what they were asking for like you

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,279
know requesting for usability tests

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,200
and user research studies um these are

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,240
just a few screenshots from some of the

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,279
projects that i

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,760
i looked at um they were asking for

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,000
design improvements or redesigns ux

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,640
reviews and it was really impressive

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,039
um back when i when i contributed and

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,840
participated in the outreach program

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,399
um there were so many designers so so

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,520
many designers looking to help make

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,440
mozilla firefox better and it's just

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,799
it's just uh proof that these open

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
source projects are

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,320
really effective in bringing together

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,320
designers and if you're an open source

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,919
project looking to get

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,600
more design contributions then you

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,320
should definitely check out either of

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
these programs

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,679
cool yeah one of the one of the things

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,600
that i really enjoyed seeing this year

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,919
i actually uh unofficially mentored

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,760
somebody the a designer that really

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,960
really wanted to apply for one of these

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,880
um and it just it made my uh heart

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,480
so happy to see um organizations that i

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
love and have been following for a

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,679
number of years uh

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:13,360
as a you know open source um

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:17,200
you know lover in a sense

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,120
uh to see them wanting skills that i

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
would have wanted to offer them earlier

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,240
in my career was just

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,240
it was just amazing and i can't wait to

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,480
see more and more of these come through

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,640
on these kinds of programs and future

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
programs as well that don't exist yet

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,000
that might

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
um think about how they can specifically

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,679
include

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,159
designers within the open source um

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,960
technology process from from right from

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,120
the beginning

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,799
right all the way through um and retain

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,080
them as well

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,679
so yeah super cool um okay so

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,440
the next section and again you're gonna

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,760
be listening to us talk a little bit

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
um so a little bit more before we head

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,720
on to our

00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,480
um our first activity

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,880
um so we often hear

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,240
when we talk about design in open source

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
um you know from

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,360
from people that have yet to be

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,120
convinced about the importance of design

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,240
in general or designed specifically in

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,080
open source

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,679
or even sometimes um you know oh well my

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,880
open source doesn't really have a design

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,600
aspect to it

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,279
and um you know a lot of what we do is

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,519
kind of

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,960
have conversations with people and try

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,159
and think well you know

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
there are lots of different things that

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,360
designers can offer an open source

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,039
project and

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,120
the limitations that we that we

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,919
sometimes put on design as a visual

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,399
medium

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,919
uh is is super restrictive and there are

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,080
so many other things that

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,039
designers can offer and we just wanted

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,720
to talk a little bit

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,559
if you're not convinced yet or if you

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,600
need to convince other people

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,960
at your open source organizations uh we

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,000
wanted to talk a bit about why you

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,919
should care about

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,399
why open source software should care

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,519
about design

00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,720
so um we

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,279
hopefully think that the people that are

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
here

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,600
are ready to be convinced or already

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,039
convinced but yes let's um

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,799
let's dive into some of the deeper

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,960
reasons about why uh

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,240
design and designers are a topic to give

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
care and attention to so i'm going to

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,360
talk

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,279
about the open design project briefly

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,679
which was a project that was

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,039
funded at ushihidi when i worked there

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,799
as their designer

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,480
and then abby abigail is going to talk

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,519
about the mozilla design contributions

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,559
straight afterwards so

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,519
um one of the first

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,519
things to talk about about why you

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,960
should care about designers and design

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,480
in open source was um what i was talking

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,200
briefly about earlier

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,200
so before i was fully embedded in the

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,880
open source community like i am now

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,559
um and kind of doing a lot of the things

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,320
that most developers would do

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,240
uh now like seeking out different open

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,960
source projects and creating issues and

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,200
doing kind of

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,760
uh all the sort of stuff that it comes

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
um reasonably naturally to people that

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,679
are embedded on the coding side of

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,519
things i would talk with my colleagues

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,200
at the open source organizations

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,720
uh organization that i worked with which

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,399
was ushihidi

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,079
including another designer that i worked

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,320
with and um

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,240
i we talked about how i would watch

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,000
these open source contributions coming

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,960
in from developers

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,040
on our tools and i would wonder and kind

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,520
of be a bit jealous and a bit sad

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,480
about not having that for the design

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,280
side of things as well and i was like oh

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,040
how can i start to build this kind of

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
energy and excitement

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,679
for the design side of this open source

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,480
tool as much as it is for the code side

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,879
of this open source tool

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,159
so we actually started off where i

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,440
started off

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,839
alongside my uh design colleague uh

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,079
looking at mozilla's open design project

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,760
and then looking into

00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,040
opensourcedesign.net and then having uh

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
some discussions uh

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,640
internally and maybe some discussions

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,000
externally with the other community

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,520
members of the open source design

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,720
group and reading academic papers

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,440
but um what i didn't see was

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,839
busy and active open source software

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,400
organizations doing design and sharing

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,720
what they learned and how and this was

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,359
how the open design project really

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
started

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,720
um to get kicked off so with the team

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,000
at ujihidi we started to work on

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,320
something that

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,400
tried to be try to embody this the

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
busyness the activeness and actively

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,280
sharing what we were learning

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,520
and how we were how we were doing it

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,040
so open design i just kind of really

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,480
briefly want to talk about it i'm not

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,640
going to go into depth about exactly

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,240
what we did because that's a whole other

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,280
kind of topic

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,640
but um the main background is that we

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,240
piloted in 2018 and 2019

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
to design jams um in berlin and seattle

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,240
with

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,000
two different partners after having

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
these conversations internally at

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,920
shahidi about what we wanted to try and

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,920
achieve we were approached by

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,680
one which was designer which is a global

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
design agency

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,000
working across many different countries

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,160
and the other was adobe

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,079
and when we start to have the

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,400
conversations with designer and adobe

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,119
about how to engage designers on

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,839
specifically the um tools that we are

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,440
working with

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,599
at the moment which is ishihidi's human

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,160
rights and humanitarian tools

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,680
we really wanted to understand the

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,920
challenges that designers

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,200
had working on open source projects and

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,680
thankfully designer

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,680
and adobe were also really interested in

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,599
this as well

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,839
so these designers within these design

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,720
jams worked on one of ushihidi's

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,119
open source humanitarian tech tools and

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,760
the

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,760
two pilots the two design jams laid the

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,480
groundwork for further research

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,200
a test methodology and a workshop

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
framework

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,119
that was then taken to two other design

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,480
communities in 2019

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,760
in late 2019 there was one in taipei

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,760
and one in bangalore

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,119
and not to dwell too much on the

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,720
intricacies

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
of everything that happened and

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
everything that was produced within the

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,160
open design project because um

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,920
we can share a link to the open repo

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,920
afterwards and you can investigate it

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,599
more deeply um but

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,000
what we learned was that there was a

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,040
huge amount of designers out there

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,359
that are working commercially

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,119
commercially in companies and agencies

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,720
that actually really want to work on

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,280
projects that give back to the world and

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
give back

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,520
to communities and they really want to

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
use their skills to help

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,680
solve complex problems for both end user

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,640
tools like the ones we were working on

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,200
at ushahidi

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,960
and also developer tools as well the

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,320
difference between a tool that does

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,440
good for a developer focus tool was not

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,079
too different from

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
something that had uh kind of very

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,880
obvious

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,119
uh human rights and humanitarian purpose

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,560
like some of ushihidi's tools

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,040
and um one of the things that i wanted

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,160
to talk about today

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,520
that came through um literally before

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
this workshop uh

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,160
went out or went live was i do

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,760
um i we do versions of this workshop for

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,760
different kinds of audiences and one of

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
those audiences is designers we do a

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
version of this workshop

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,800
for designers that want to contribute to

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,119
open source but don't know how

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
and i had a piece of feedback from a

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,520
designer about the workshop that i gave

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,440
in

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,320
july which was

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,960
just to comment on how uh how they

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,400
wanted

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,880
so how they so passionately wanted to

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
understand how a project uh needed them

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,240
so that they could

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,079
um put together a pitch so what they

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,160
said was

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,480
what would have really helped me to know

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,599
that this project wants me

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,520
was the question that they asked

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,760
themselves in the workshop and they

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,680
thought about focusing on

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,599
a part of the open source process which

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,839
was building a case study

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,920
uh that they the designer would then

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,599
send to a specific project to outline

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,200
how they could add value

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,640
uh design value and how

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,280
to really help the open source projects

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,800
um

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,560
better understand this is what i can

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,960
provide and this is why i care

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,839
and this is how i'm going to help you so

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,839
that to me

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,040
shows that there are so many designers

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,280
out there that are so

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,560
passionate about wanting to help and

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,680
wanting to contribute

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,359
that they are there um thinking about

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,800
these proposals

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,160
um these these case study values um

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,520
documents that they can send to these

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,760
open source projects to

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
to ask them like please please let me

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,000
help

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,240
so the other thing that i wanted to

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,680
briefly talk about i think

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,839
um is more of a general thing so

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,240
it's about believing in how design can

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,160
help improve open source software

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,920
so there's a lot of well-documented

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,560
business cases in technology

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,160
for how design improves revenue for

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,160
profit making companies

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,520
and there's a few links on this mirror

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
board if you did want to investigate

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,440
some of the things that i've read in the

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,319
past to

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,920
to communicate how design in can improve

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:17,280
technology products and

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,119
and for-profit products but i

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,720
when i see these and when i've read

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,880
these and when i've

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,000
learned from these documents about how

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,359
design adds value

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,640
to tech products generally i

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,280
don't hear tech products that are for

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,480
profit

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,520
um and don't think about how that could

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,640
also benefit

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,800
open source software so any of these

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,800
uh pieces of information i think can

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,680
also be used to build a case for

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,160
how design can improve what the open

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,319
source software's goals are as well

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,520
so if your open source software's got

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,200
software goals

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,319
are to include a certain type of person

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,200
within the work that you do

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,920
within the purpose of the open source

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,000
software

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,319
then design is a function that can help

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,440
you better understand those people

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,119
better serve those people uh it doesn't

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,560
necessarily need to be through some kind

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,800
of graphical ui

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,960
but it could just be purely about better

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,359
understanding the needs of those

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,359
users and coming up with really solid

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,839
plans on how to engage with them and how

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,119
to

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,480
provide services or tools or the

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,280
software indeed

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,119
uh and better towards how they would

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,880
actually use it

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,400
so that was what i briefly

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
wanted to talk about uh just the

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,079
background from open

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
the open design project from ujihidi and

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,599
just how

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,520
um it came through so clearly through

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,720
that project and then through all other

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,000
things that i've done with designers

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,640
around open source about

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,319
how much they really want to be included

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,440
and they really care about these kinds

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,480
of projects

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,480
so over to abby

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,400
oh you're muted abby yeah yes

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,240
definitely designers really always you

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,160
know wants to make

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,680
contributions open source to make it

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,800
better to improve

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,520
it um i personally experience that

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,880
when i again i'm mentioning the

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,200
outreaching

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,800
program so i was an applicant for the

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,640
mozilla firefox

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,440
project and it's important to know that

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,960
i was not the selected outreach intern

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,119
i was an applicant and there was a

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,319
period where we were encouraged to make

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,440
contributions

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,240
in the form of conducting a ux review

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
of the mozilla firefox preview app that

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,160
was the mobile

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,760
application for android and i had to

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,680
review that application for

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,880
usability issues for about some of the

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,280
biggest issues

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,880
um bring them to their attention and

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,200
explain how i would go about

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,319
solving those issues as a designer and

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,640
how i would measure

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,400
the effectiveness of my design and i

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,960
love how practical that was

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,160
because they could see the direct and

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,880
effect of you know

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,200
designers contributing to open source so

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,119
this

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,560
is just an example of one of the issues

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,960
i raised i raised um a couple of them

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,720
and i was happy to see that the team

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,560
actually took these issues seriously and

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,760
they started trying to address them so

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,319
one of them was

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
um on the app there was the call to

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,520
action

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,800
for the login onboarding card and i felt

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,400
that it wasn't

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,079
explanatory enough like someone

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,760
downloaded the application

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,079
might not know exactly what that um

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
that term or whatever they used there

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,160
meant and i brought this to their

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,440
attention

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,160
i made a few suggestions to improve that

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,440
and yeah it was it was great to see you

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,200
know everyone

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,280
working together to solve that issue

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,520
they had content they had you know

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,880
engineering and that was that was

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,680
exciting to see i've

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,599
mentioned some of the issues in the

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,920
slides you can take a look at them

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,800
and um by the side you can also see the

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,920
full review

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,640
of the app so i just love that

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
um that gave me the opportunity to make

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
some positive

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
impacts it's something that people were

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,920
already using and that just goes to show

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,599
that designers definitely want to make

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,040
these contributions they're really just

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,040
looking for a way

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,480
to do that and yeah i'm grateful for

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,280
that opportunity as well and it's

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,839
something that

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,839
i would be excited to see more of going

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
forward

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,160
cool so it is

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,240
uh 15 minutes to uh the top of the hour

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,280
uh we the next thing that we have

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,119
planned uh

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,720
in this uh is no more uh

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,040
talking just uh from from us we've now

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,599
got

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,960
um a activity um

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,839
planned for everyone well i um

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,079
my volunteer is telling me that um since

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,359
uh more people have joined uh there are

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,280
not as many people that have written

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,160
down their names in the um

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,880
the group section of the mirror board so

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,520
we're gonna

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,520
take a little detour and take a little

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,920
like five minute section of this to

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,760
make sure that people that want to be in

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,520
a group to do this activity

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,800
get the opportunity to write down their

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,400
names in a group

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,920
so uh what i'm gonna do is

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,680
head over to the section on the mirror

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,560
board and show you all where you can put

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,760
down your name

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:30,240
for the group activity so um

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,040
i'm going to make sure that everyone has

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,079
access to the link so

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,800
if you can everyone that is currently in

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,160
attendance

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,119
you should see in the zoom chat there is

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,160
a bitly link

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,359
to this presentation board and this is

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,319
where we're going to be doing the

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,839
activities

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,839
the group activities and the solo

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,880
activities and don't worry too much if

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,400
you're moving things around

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
really really don't don't stress out

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,520
this is what miro is is supposed to be

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,960
for it's supposed to be for active

00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,319
collaboration which is um

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,400
one of the best things um it does

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,480
so what we'd like you to do is if you

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,359
want to participate and we really do

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,200
encourage you to be

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,280
active participation in active

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,839
participants in this section

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,720
um is pop your name in one of the groups

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,599
and there's five

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,800
people um we can have five people in a

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,520
group at once

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,560
so if you just want to take some time to

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,119
make sure that you're

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,839
on the board and make sure that you want

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,720
to be

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,960
in this group and if you double click on

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,440
the um

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,880
on the uh post-it note the virtual

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,079
post-it note you should be able to

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,440
highlight and add

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,319
a name if for some reason uh that's not

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,280
working

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,599
then excellent i can see some people

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,720
typing and changing

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,079
cool um but if that if for some reason

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,800
you're struggling to do that you can

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,280
always um

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,280
add text over to the side here there's a

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,000
there's a way that you can add text

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,319
to the memory board using the left-hand

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,960
section which is text

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:05,760
or you can even add add in a new

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,839
post-it note and type in your name on

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,119
one of those and just kind of

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,440
resize it and then you can move it over

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,720
to

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,720
to the group but i'm gonna take

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,920
five minutes for everyone to get on that

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,680
link

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,960
that is on the chat and to write your

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,839
names down in the groups

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,520
so we're gonna take a really quick five

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,079
minutes um

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,160
and i'm gonna meet myself while this

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,760
happens

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:39,839
let us know if you're having trouble in

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,839
the chat in the zoom chat

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,480
if we if we don't get anyone going

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,800
going in groups which is i have to admit

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,319
not something that we anticipated

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,880
um then what we will do oh okay we're

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,880
getting

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,000
oh nice thanks it just yeah i mean i

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,480
should have just waited for the five

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,800
minutes

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,680
okay i'm gonna be quiet and let everyone

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:21,839
join their groups

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:21,839
okay i'll be back in one minute

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:14,319
okay cool so we've got we've got

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,200
two groups so far if anyone's hesitating

00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,240
to join a group

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,079
the activities that we've got planned

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,880
they're they're all about discussion

00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,480
experimentation

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
it's not necessarily about getting

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,359
anything perfectly right it's about

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,119
having a go

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,400
so really if you're hesitating you're

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,920
like oh i'm not really sure what are you

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,800
gonna ask me to do

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,160
um are you are you gonna ask me to do

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,880
some design work where

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,319
we're not asking you to do design work

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,200
or at least not yet

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,319
um but yeah we really do encourage you

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,800
to give it a go

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,800
so we need we need another three people

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,119
in group number two

00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,480
ah excellent also one of the things that

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,000
i quite like about using a mirror board

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,200
is that people that maybe haven't used

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,040
mirror boards

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,400
yeah of course it of course a developer

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,079
can join that's the whole point

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,079
yeah developers are very welcome

00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,640
yeah yeah

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,160
all of the all of the activities that me

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
and abby have um

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,800
uh curated for this session is all about

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,720
um you know introducing

00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:35,040
open source maintainers developers

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,359
coders into some of the design thinking

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,040
so

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,359
none of the activities require any kind

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,800
of

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,119
design expertise at all so really do not

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,119
worry

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,839
how awesome

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,079
okay so because we've got because we've

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,000
got two groups

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,440
we're gonna we're gonna go with the two

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,800
groups that want to do the active

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:18,079
participation

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:23,839
uh uh s barna no the groups are

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,839
if you i will drop the link

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,680
so if you can go here

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,200
on the link that's in the chat that will

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,079
take you to what you see on the screen

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,280
it should open up a browser tab for this

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,480
um

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,880
it's kind of like an interactive

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
whiteboard is me miro what we're using

00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,200
here

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,559
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,280
do the magic thing where i bring

00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,319
everyone to me

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,680
and what we should see is lots and lots

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,480
of cursors

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,000
for lots and lots of people so if you

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,000
haven't put down your name in one of the

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,040
groups yet

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,280
pop your name down to add in your name

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,559
all you need to do is a couple of double

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,680
clicks on the

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,359
text in the in the card and then you

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,520
know you just do the highlight and then

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,520
just

00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,839
type

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,200
so we've got a full group two so for

00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,880
anyone that wants to still join a group

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,400
we would need to we need to fill up

00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,599
group three

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:39,200
um i'm going to give it one more minute

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,200
and if nobody else

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,480
wants to

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,640
[Music]

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,760
do the active participation part of the

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,480
workshop

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,760
then we will go with the two groups and

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,200
they will have a good time in their

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,559
jitsi rooms

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,559
discussing the activity

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,160
so you're totally welcome to just hang

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,200
out and and wait for

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,280
the activity the people that are um

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,559
part of the activity to finish and come

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,280
back and

00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,720
listen in there's no obligation to do

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,640
active participation

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,680
but there will be a 15 to 20 minute gap

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,440
where the two groups or the groups are

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,559
going to be talking about their activity

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,160
and working on their activity

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,720
so if you want to be part of that

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:43,839
then joining and starting another group

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:43,839
is highly recommended

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,960
we can uh we can if you're having

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,880
trouble adding your name to one of these

00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,760
cards we can totally add you into a

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,119
group yourself

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,960
if you want to just type in the zoom

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,920
chat if you haven't added yourself to a

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,440
group yet

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,839
if you want to just type in the zoom

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,200
chat that you want to be part of a group

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:25,839
then we can manually add you to a group

00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:25,839
and give you your jitsi room link

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,119
and again i'll bring everyone to me just

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,119
in case folks are

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,760
so you'll need to come back to your

00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,920
jitsi rooms

00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,520
uh for the activity but first we just

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,520
need to we need to take some time and

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,040
explain what we're going to be doing

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,319
so there's still time to add yourself to

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,319
a group we'll come back to this once

00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,720
we've explained the activity but abby

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:10,640
let's

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:14,000
let's head into the first activity um

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,720
cool okay so folks i'm going to

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,280
spend some time explaining what we're

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,280
going to do

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:26,640
so bear with me as i find

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,640
where we are

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,839
we're here okay

00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,920
so the first activity that we're going

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,440
to do

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,839
is a activity called welcoming designers

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,880
to

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:50,079
your open source software

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,839
so we're looking at rooms

00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,839
of around five different people to have

00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,079
these discussions and you can

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,359
stay in the main room if you just want

00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,200
to um

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,040
you know hang out and wait until other

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,119
people are done with their activity

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:07,440
and listening to to what they discover

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,880
but um it will be silent in the main

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,079
zoom room while other people

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,359
are working on their um

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,720
breakout discussions um

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,880
so the aim of this activity is

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,880
to demonstrate and explore how designers

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,040
might approach a project

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,079
to discuss the motivations and goals

00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,799
needed

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,760
and needs of designers in open source

00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,000
software

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,240
and to think about how your own open

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,400
source software projects are

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,760
set up for these needs or set set for

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,559
these needs

00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,839
and to prepare the key processes that

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,359
encourage and support design

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,799
contributions so those are some of the

00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,680
aims that you might want to think about

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,880
as we go through this activity

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,440
so i'm going to move the mirror board

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,520
again

00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,920
to talk about the activity that we have

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,920
planned

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,799
so here we are so one of the great

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,440
things about being able to do activities

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,680
like this

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,200
in this way is that you can always come

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,799
back to this material

00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,960
after the workshop so you can always the

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,440
instructions are here if you wanted to

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,920
take

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,040
take this to your teams and work on it

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,559
in your teams

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,240
if you wanted to work on it afterwards

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,240
or if you wanted to work on it solo

00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,520
after the workshop or during this

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,599
workshop you're absolutely more than

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,640
welcome to do

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,200
but what we've got here is

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,839
for each of the rooms in which you'll be

00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,280
having your

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,119
in the gypsy rooms where you'll be

00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,040
having your group discussions

00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,559
we've got um different templates just

00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,720
below so

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,880
these are split out for each group so

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,160
we've got one for group one

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,920
and there's a section where you can

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,640
double click click and add your names in

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,240
there

00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,240
um and then we've got a series of

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,200
different questions

00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,880
um for you to answer um please be aware

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,160
that some people in your rooms might not

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,880
want to use their video

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,640
or a microphone so you might um want to

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,240
wait for some people to type in the chat

00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,040
when you're in your breakout

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,760
gypsy rooms um but what we've got on

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,839
each group

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,319
is we've got uh what we're calling a

00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:08,960
design designer profile

00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,079
so group number one is going to look at

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,280
vanessa

00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:15,920
and vanessa is an early career design

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,280
designer she's an open source software

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,359
novice

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,480
she started learning about design about

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,240
a year ago

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,760
takes online design courses and reads

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,440
some books and articles on user

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,839
experience design

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,760
she gets contracts uh to design small

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,960
websites and simple apps from people in

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,720
her network

00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,720
and she wants to contribute to something

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,559
more meaningful and impactful

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,160
and she believes open source would be a

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,640
great place to start

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,359
she has some skills in graphic design

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,160
and user interface design or ui design

00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:48,240
and her goals are that she is eager to

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,520
take on new design challenges to improve

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,640
skills

00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,160
so what we've got on the side here so

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,440
what we want you to do is obviously

00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,920
you're going to spend a bit of time

00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,839
introducing yourselves to each other and

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,000
then what we want you to do

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,880
is talk about this designer talk about

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,359
this

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,119
person that wants to contribute to the

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,359
open source projects that you might be

00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,720
part of don't worry too much if you're

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,359
not part of an open source project at

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,880
the moment

00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,960
because these questions are fairly

00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,040
universal they're about welcoming people

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,960
and better understanding them so the

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,040
kinds of questions that we've got here

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,480
are have you met someone like this

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,200
before

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,880
um what kinds of uh what kinds of

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,880
conversations have you had with them

00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,920
and here is where you can double click

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,799
to

00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,319
edit the text in the mirror board and

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,000
we've got questions like

00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,760
how would you welcome this person to

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,200
your open source software project and

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,400
what is maybe the first step that you

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,839
would take

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,920
what do you think would make them feel

00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:45,359
welcome and what is one small change

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,880
that you can make to your open source

00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,319
project that would help this person

00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,520
contribute

00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,280
if you have a project that you're

00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,640
affiliated with if you're not affiliated

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,480
with a project you can

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,160
pick the mozilla project as an example

00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,160
or you could pick a project that you

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,400
know about that you're not necessarily

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,079
affiliated with but you know about the

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,319
idea is to just explore the different

01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,000
ways that you can welcome designers into

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,440
open source software

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,359
you've got a little section down here

01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,200
for notes if you're

01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,200
wanting to type stuff down which doesn't

01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,280
necessarily fit these questions

01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,880
um but what we really want you to do is

01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,359
have conversations about the

01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,359
this kind of designer that are assigned

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,920
to each of your groups

01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,280
and uh think about how to how to make

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,280
them feel welcome

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,960
so what we're going to do is we're going

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,760
to make sure that everyone's in

01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,359
their gypsy rooms we're going to mute

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,640
ourselves on the main

01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:43,040
zoom and we're going to spend the next

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:46,079
um we're going to spend the next

01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:49,119
15 minutes uh talking

01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,240
about uh this this activity in our

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,440
groups

01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,799
so um the only

01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,400
the last piece of advice that i would

01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,960
give you is the instructions are all

01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,480
here

01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,000
so if you get lost and you want to

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,480
review the instructions

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,839
you can take a look and take a another

01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,960
read and

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:10,400
review it um you

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,000
don't worry about moving anything or

01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,680
not on clicking on anything that you

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,960
shouldn't um i've just made sure that i

01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,240
locked the parts that you

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,240
you don't need to edit you should be

01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,000
able to edit all the different text

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,000
and i would say that it's probably a

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,799
good idea to assign at least one person

01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,160
in your group

01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:28,640
to a typer or

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,280
somebody that's going to edit the the

01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,760
questions

01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,040
in the mirror board so with that

01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,079
the last thing that i want to make sure

01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,880
people are able to do

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,079
is in your different groups you should

01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,520
have a little link

01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,720
to a gypsy room uh what you'll need to

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,480
do is click on that link

01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,839
and it will open up a separate video

01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,359
call in a browser

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,880
you'll need to join that room and then

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,559
you can start having a conversation with

01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,160
the people in that group

01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,280
so what i'm going to do is i am going to

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,720
mute the zoom now

01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,119
we're going to take 15 minutes on the

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,839
clock we'll come back quarter past

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,559
uh the hour and then we're going to do a

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,559
group

01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,839
we're going to do a report back from

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,119
each of the groups on what they

01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,480
discussed and what they learned

01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,319
about this activity so if you have any

01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,480
problems again you can use the zoom chat

01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,720
but me and abby are gonna head into

01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,839
both of the gypsy rooms as well to help

01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:29,920
people out

01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:32,720
so see you in your jitsi breakout rooms

01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,520
okay um oh gosh we went a couple of

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,480
minutes over

01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,520
um i was having a really uh interesting

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,760
conversation

01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,240
uh how about you abby how was your in

01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:45,039
group two

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,319
yes um i really loved like how valuable

01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,400
the contributions are

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,599
she was like really thinking about the

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,280
persona like

01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,200
and it's someone that they can you know

01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,480
understand and relate to

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,240
it was great oh cool right so um

01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,640
because i'm sharing my screen i'll move

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,160
away from the group the groups and i'll

01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,920
head to the activity

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,920
um uh that we've just completed so for

01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,559
the folks that didn't um

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,359
join a breakout room uh this is what we

01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,280
were working on

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,760
in our breakout rooms we were talking

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,960
about these individual designer

01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,839
profiles that we've got on the left hand

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,079
side here

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,039
we've got one about an early career

01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,079
designer in

01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:29,760
open source and the second group

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:32,640
was working on a more experienced

01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,520
specialist kind of persona which um i

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,520
can't wait to

01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:40,559
to read um what's going on there

01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,240
um because i found this one

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,480
personally you know a specialist can

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,760
sometimes be a bit intimidating

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,880
um so what we're gonna do

01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,599
um really briefly is um we're gonna do

01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,039
a short report back on what we learned

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,400
so

01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:01,760
um what we would like uh

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,880
folks um to do is

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,920
either uh from group number one

01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,720
um and group number two if you'd like to

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,280
to um add something into the zoom chat

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,400
about

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,000
what what you we discussed in your

01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,960
groups and what you you might have

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,359
learned

01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,520
and something that you might take back

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:25,200
to your organizations

01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:27,440
so um just doing a quick

01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,799
up from group number one i'll maybe do

01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,960
group number one and you can do group

01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,319

01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,680
that really um a lot of the things that

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,000
we identified

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,880
uh that would welcome this person best

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,960
is

01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,160
things like being available and being

01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,039
responsive to

01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,760
to what they're asking for listening to

01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,599
them

01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,839
and one of the things that came out of

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:17,200
my my group that i was sat in that i

01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:19,599
thought was fantastic was there some uh

01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,799
details about asking design specific

01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,920
questions

01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:25,440
so um when we were talking about how

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,720
would you welcome this person to your

01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,920
open source project

01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,960
what's the first step that you would

01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,599
take uh one of the people in in group

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,200
number one

01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,280
said ask them what their favorite design

01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,559
tools are because

01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,559
most people that work with tools uh for

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,599
their job function will have some kind

01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,960
of favorite tool or

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:48,480
a favorite aspect of a tool um

01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,960
so in this what you're signaling is that

01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,319
you

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,359
are inviting them into

01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:58,880
participation that is beyond kind of

01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:01,520
your kind of strict knowledge of say

01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,960
development sites uh the development

01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,400
side of things the coding side of things

01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,920
with the open source side and things and

01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,920
taking an active interest in

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,680
what they want to bring to the table by

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,280
asking them just a simple question like

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,680
what design tools do you use

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,240
it's a really simple way to indicate

01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,240
your interest

01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:23,440
abby okay um

01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,359
so for group two we were looking at and

01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,640
experienced your ex researcher so she's

01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:29,359
the specialist

01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:31,200
um so when we talked about you know if

01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,720
we've met people like this before

01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,160
um yeah some of them had and they said

01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,760
you know they would try to find out

01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,440
where her drivers are like what

01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,119
makes her interesting when she

01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,359
contributes or

01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,960
um and you know someone thought that

01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:46,079
good documentation on the project would

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,559
really be helpful for

01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,280
someone like this since she is someone

01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,200
who you know

01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,880
relates more to documentation and

01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,640
writing and research

01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,720
so you know having the documentation

01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,039
would definitely help her feel welcome

01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,000
and you know be helpful and then we

01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,920
talked about

01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,680
how they would welcome her to the oss

01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,480
project and it was

01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,000
just this empathetic approach you know

01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,160
letting her know that

01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,400
her input is valuable her ideas and

01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,400
suggestions would always be welcome

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,079
and trying to connect the project's

01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,960
overall vision because you know

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,240
definitely they know that that's when um

01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,680
her design choices

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,319
and also making sure that she's

01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,240
connected to you know key people

01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,839
on the project because you know that can

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,359
help them have like some human

01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,480
interaction and really make you feel

01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,640
welcome

01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,480
and giving her access to all the project

01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,599
representatives as well so she can find

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,799
out you know where she wants to

01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,319
contribute to

01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,480
and you know talking about what would

01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,640
make her feel welcome you know asking

01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,640
her to share some of her past projects

01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,920
that way they can kind of assess her and

01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,960
you know know the kind of

01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,240
contributions she can make um that would

01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,680
be great for the team

01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,280
and making sure that the documentation

01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,039
isn't full of technical jargon

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,280
that you know she would not be able to

01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:00,880
understand you know um

01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,799
and a small change if they ensure that

01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,160
even projects have good documentation

01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,760
because that is somewhere

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,760
they believe someone like nelly would

01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,079
start from when she wants to make a

01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,119
contribution of research project so this

01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,680
was this was really great feedback

01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,759
this is fantastic so uh for all of the

01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,920
people that were skeptical about uh

01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,000
active participation this is the kind of

01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,480
um results that you can get from just a

01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,440
really

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,040
quick um full exercise just asking a few

01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,839
different kinds of questions and and

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,000
kind of

01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,199
really taking the time to discuss the

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,920
these um

01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:36,480
whilst also having uh a point of

01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:40,000
reference these these designer profiles

01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:43,199
me and abby um wrote these um

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,239
with you know actually quite a

01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:48,319
lot of real life experience um

01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,359
uh baked into them a lot of them are

01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,960
people that we know

01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,719
within the open source community or

01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,600
people that we

01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,679
um have talked to that want to be part

01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,679
of the open source community so they are

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,319
you know they're not real people but

01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,159
they embody a lot of real people

01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,239
and taking the time to really understand

01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:09,759
them is so so valuable um

01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:11,679
for helping uh them to to contribute

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,520
um one of the things that you picked out

01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,560
abby that i love that your group

01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:20,159
um spoke about was involving

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:24,000
nelly who is a more experienced

01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:27,600
researcher designer in the vision

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,920
of the open source software project so

01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,120
the somebody like nelly a very

01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,520
experienced

01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,279
designer that's worked on very big

01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,839
projects most likely

01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,480
could really help with those product

01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,279
vision

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,040
from a design perspective uh things that

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:46,560
open source software um

01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,319
often needs um help with you know

01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,560
and that she would likely be very very

01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,080
happy to help with those kinds of things

01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,480
um i just wanted to signal one thing

01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,520
that jeremy um has popped in the chat

01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,679
which i think is great

01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,440
um about the early career designer as

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,199
well that we looked at in group number

01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,920
one

01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:09,600
so this um person was very new to design

01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,840
and the um to encourage uh

01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,640
be encouraging and understanding that

01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,760
this person

01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,159
this early career designer that is also

01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:21,280
really new to open source as well

01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:24,320
might not bring solutions to the project

01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,000
in ways that maybe a more experienced

01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,000
designer would do

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,280
and the one of the big things that can

01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,640
happen with a lot of

01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,679
eager early career younger designers

01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,280
is that the expectations for them to

01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:42,320
produce certain kinds of design

01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,679
can be um can be

01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,440
just not quite what they're able to

01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,480
offer right now or that they might need

01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,400
more guidance from a a person like nelly

01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,600
so you might want to think one of the

01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,199
great things that you can do with these

01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,920
profiles is you can think about how

01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,800
these

01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,280
different contributors can help each

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,520
other

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:05,280
as well when you invite different kinds

01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,199
of design contributors into your project

01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,960
that was really fun i know that it was a

01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,199
little bit uh difficult to kind of

01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,960
sometimes participation and on zoom and

01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,159
using mirror can be a bit hard but i'm

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,719
so glad that we

01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,280
um got through it and we got some great

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:21,040
stuff down

01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,920
uh in the board so i'm gonna head back

01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,290
to the slides

01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,120
uh we've got um

01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:28,159
[Music]

01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,800
gonna reorient myself with where we're

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,080
at

01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,600
and make sure that we've covered

01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,280
everything that we needed to cover for

01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,600
welcoming designers into your open

01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,600
source

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,159
um one of the things that i'd really

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,679
like to uh

01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:44,239
hear from the attendees is what do you

01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,159
feel

01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,679
like you would need more information

01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,679
about in

01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,120
being welcoming for designers one of the

01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,520
things that's really great for us

01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,719
as people constructing workshops around

01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,159
these kinds of

01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:01,440
needs and issues is um letting us know

01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:02,960
either through the zoom chat or later on

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,000
in the q a session

01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,400
about what you think might not we

01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,679
that you might need more resources on um

01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,199
the questions that you have

01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,040
uh cropping up when you work through

01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,440
these uh activities

01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,120
um you might start to think about how

01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,520
you're welcoming designers but you might

01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,280
start to think oh maybe we're not quite

01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,800
there with our documentation yet how can

01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,640
we actually you know

01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,719
uh work more in a more design

01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,719
way with our documentation so that's

01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,400
just an example of the top of my head

01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,280
but yeah have a think about what more

01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,280
information you need

01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,600
okay so uh our next um

01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,679
our next section is going to be about

01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,400
design documentation

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,920
and we're actually um right on time to

01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:52,159
be moving into our next section

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:54,159
session uh section of this um so uh

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,920
great that we've been able to recap some

01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,760
of the the technical

01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:02,159
uh time so i'm gonna talk um

01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,000
i'm gonna talk a little bit uh about

01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:06,000
design documentation and a few different

01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,840
um aspects of design documentation that

01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,960
i think is useful for a folks to know

01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,920
so um once you've started to become more

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,600
involved in

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,199
open source software as a designer

01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,600
you're much more forgiving of

01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:21,760
how we don't typically get added into

01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,719
the onboarding

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,360
for contributors so we tend to kind of

01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,760
expect

01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:30,800
not to be included in readme

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,520
documentation or contributor

01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,640
documentation and you know a lot of us

01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,719
are

01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,719
quite surprised when we do see design

01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,400
mentioned you know it's a nice little oh

01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,360
oh they've actually mentioned design you

01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:46,000
know so but a lot of designers are

01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,040
pretty much expecting to not have a

01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
great deal

01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,040
of information there just yet and there

01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,239
are a lot of them

01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,920
are really

01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:58,880
willing and able to help out with that

01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,880
side of things as well

01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,199
um but we now have a number of different

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,520
things that we're going to introduce to

01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,360
you

01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,520
from a design documentation point of

01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,320
view that we think that you can do to

01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,360
improve

01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,920
the designer contribution experience and

01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,640
these

01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,199
are looking at some of the standard um

01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:21,440
parts of an open source project

01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:23,280
um so this is more of a solo activity

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,560
so we won't be using the breakout room

01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,880
so everyone should be able to

01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,640
participate in this activity

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,600
it's mostly about listening in and

01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,600
responding to the questions in the chat

01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:40,080
so on to design documentation

01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,480
so the three sections that we've decided

01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,320
to

01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,600
focus on for this even though there are

01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,719
lots of different things that you can do

01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,920
with documentation

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,960
to improve it for designers the first

01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,320
one

01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:56,560
is on the readme so

01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:58,560
uh i like to try and ask

01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,239
open source software organizations and

01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,400
open source software

01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:04,080
projects these kinds of sets of

01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,520
questions

01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,960
so ask yourself um right now

01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,679
as this is another active um part of the

01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,600
session

01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,960
have a think as i as i ask you these

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,120
questions what your responses to

01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,400
to them will be so you might want to

01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,400
type in the chat or you might want to

01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,719
type in a note stock or you might want

01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,239
to

01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:27,280
write down on paper next to you

01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:30,480
but um how can your

01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,080
readme file or your design contribution

01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,199
document if you don't want to

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:38,719
have it within your readme file how can

01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:39,840
that documentation welcome designers of

01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:44,800
all types

01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,800
or specific types that you know you want

01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,920
so i'll just say that one again ask

01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,880
yourself how can our

01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,239
readme or design contribution doc

01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,679
welcome designers

01:15:54,239 --> 01:16:00,719
of all types or specific types

01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:03,920
you know you want

01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:06,000
these aren't necessarily trick questions

01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,440
there are no wrong answers so whatever

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,760
kind of pops to your mind

01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,520
might be the perfect way to start this

01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,719
work

01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,159
so the next question is ask yourself

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,239
how can our readme or design

01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:21,840
contribution doc

01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:24,560
invite design general contributions so

01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,360
general design contributions or very

01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,640
specific

01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,640
design contributions

01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:39,120
the next one is how can our readme or

01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,920
contribution doc show supporting info

01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,920
that you can give designers so existing

01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,400
design work and processes

01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,600
so how can our readme or design

01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,080
contribution doc

01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,719
show supporting info that you can give

01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,719
designers

01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,159
don't worry if you're still catching up

01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,480
a lot of these are still

01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,920
written down in the mirror board you'll

01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,360
be able to look at them

01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:12,080
again you might just want to write down

01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,400
one word or a couple of kind of quick

01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,400
notes

01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,000
so another question is how can i read me

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,320
or design contribution doc

01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,320
um

01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,080
what how can your readme ask

01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,239
what kind of help would you ask for

01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,719
designers so

01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:38,719
how can your readme ask for the kind of

01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,719
help that you want to ask from designers

01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,400
do you just want design work or

01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:46,159
processes or training

01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,760
so the example there gives gives a

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:49,679
little bit of extra information

01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,960
so when you're writing your readme or

01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,719
your design contribution

01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,840
uh section of your um contribution doc

01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,400
uh what kind of help would you ask of

01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,320
designers

01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,920
do you want them to produce certain

01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:06,719
kinds of work

01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,719
do you want them to offer

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:14,560
different kinds of contributions

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,360
processes or training or supporting

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,360
other designers

01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,679
and another one so uh how can our readme

01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,360
or design contribution doc help

01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,000
designers get started on your open

01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,000
source project

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,920
without understanding all of the

01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,600
complexity

01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:36,239
so this one i've added in because

01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,440
sometimes it's really hard to know what

01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:41,840
an open source software

01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,840
project does without

01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,760
doing an environment on your local

01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:48,800
machine and

01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,719
and uh you know understanding all the

01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,440
intricacies of what's in development at

01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,880
the moment

01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,199
and maybe what branches people are

01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,440
working on and making sure that you

01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:59,520
have like your local host set up which

01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,440
is sometimes things that

01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,560
not a lot of designers have a lot of

01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,280
experience in

01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,159
so how can your readme help designers

01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,400
get started

01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:11,280
without necessarily having to do that

01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,280
part of the process

01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,600
and i'm starting to see some stuff

01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,760
coming on chat you can totally

01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,040
um you can write things down yourself or

01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,679
you can pop things in the chat when you

01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,800
think of them

01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,480
absolutely encourage folks to do that

01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,400
and the last one is how can your readme

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,480
appeal to designers that want to work on

01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,840
projects for good as a focus

01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,280
so one of the things that we learn is

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,360
that designers really want to work on

01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,840
things that are helping other people

01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,440
and that could be other developers

01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,679
working on developer tools

01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,400
so how are you communicating in your

01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:45,840
readme and your documentations

01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,920
uh the what your open source

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,120
project is doing is something that's

01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,840
meaningful for

01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,360
for the people that use it to try and

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,040
really communicate to

01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,920
the designers who they're helping by

01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,920
designing this better

01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:02,480
so the last thing that i'm gonna do here

01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,040
and again you can

01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,920
ask these kinds of questions uh after

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,800
this you can

01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,880
change the questions around um a lot of

01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,800
my dyslexia is showing in some of the

01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,960
wording of these questions because

01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,719
some of the questions do not have

01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,400
certain words in them so i hope that

01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,880
they do make enough sense

01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,600
um but yeah you can ask these questions

01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,199
or you can

01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,880
ask slightly different questions but the

01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:27,440
main thing is that you're asking

01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,280
questions within your readme within your

01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,120
contribution docs within all of your

01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,040
documentation how can we include

01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:37,120
designers and how can we

01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:39,440
make information more accessible to them

01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,679
so an example that i have um that you

01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,560
can you can find a link to on the miro

01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,560
board or if you were

01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,360
if you um have github open is pali

01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:51,520
and pali is with um instead of the two

01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,840
ls it's two ones

01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,199
there's a link on the um on the mirror

01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:59,280
board that you can see

01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:04,000
but i like to call pally an example

01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:06,960
of minimum viable design docs or mvdd

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,320
for short um and uh the example that

01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,120
i've got here on a screenshot

01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,000
is that they have a um they have a

01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,600
contribution

01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,880
doc called designers.md

01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,159
and this contribution um dock that they

01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,880
have for designers

01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,600
really only includes a few pieces of

01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,199
resources

01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,280
like some branding some design

01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:29,600
guidelines some resources that they

01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,760
already have that was already created

01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,920
but mostly has this statement which i

01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,520
think is a beautiful statement and i'll

01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,000
post i'll post the link to the project

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,520
in the in the chat in a moment

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,320
um it has this statement which was

01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,440
um pali hasn't had loads of attention in

01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,920
this area

01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,719
i.e design and we'd love you for you to

01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,159
join us

01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,719
it's time to bring some thought and

01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:55,040
consistency to our project designs

01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,040
like as a minimum viable design

01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,400
documentation statement for including

01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,800
designers

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,719
that is a perfect first statement that

01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,000
you can make to signal to designers that

01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,520
you're ready to

01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:11,040
start having contributions from them

01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,920
uh abby's just posted the uh link to the

01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,320
uh project in the in the chat um to go

01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,440
through

01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:19,840
the next couple of sections um on uh

01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:23,440
documentation

01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,560
um we have labels so um

01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,080
things to think about when you're

01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,280
thinking about different labels within

01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,760
your repository

01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,440
if you're anything like me um working

01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,400
across multiple different kind of open

01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,199
source projects

01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,719
all at the same time each project has a

01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:38,480
different way of doing labels and

01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,719
and there maybe are some universal

01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,000
labels and not universal labels and

01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,159
sometimes the

01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,199
conversations that you have about adding

01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,960
a new label

01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,800
is a really tricky one because we've got

01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,639
too many labels already and really do we

01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,719
really need to add another label

01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,920
and the answer uh tends to be when

01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,639
you're thinking about including

01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,639
designers

01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,800
is that more labels that are more

01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,320
specific really do help

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,159
and that if you find that you're not

01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,719
using them you can always remove them or

01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:06,320
you can always edit them and change them

01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,159
so some of the things to think about and

01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,880
ask yourself when thinking about labels

01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,719
are

01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,719
what kinds of labels do you think you'll

01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:16,000
need and why

01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:18,400
what labels might be missing and how

01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,440
can we set up a process for design

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,239
labels

01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,719
we might not know we need yet and this

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,280
is

01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:27,760
one of the most important ones so how

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,679
can you think about a process

01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,000
where designers that are coming in to

01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,920
contribute can actually help you

01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,159
develop these sets of labels to then

01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:39,760
help further designers

01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:41,520
so um remember it's totally fine

01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,679
to be inviting designers to help you

01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,159
with your labels as a way to engage with

01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,520
them

01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:49,600
so how would you as a designer want this

01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,960
piece of work this issue to be labeled

01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,000
what kind of work do you think is

01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,320
involved in this

01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,560
is it user testing is it user interface

01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,480
is it is it graphic design

01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,800
and that kind of interaction can really

01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:03,840
help you actually include more designers

01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,840
in your project

01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:10,639
as the first kind of engagement

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,800
um i recommend a good way of starting is

01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,719
to list your existing labels both your

01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,960
design ones if you have them or and

01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,320
other labels and think about the kind of

01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,880
design work that you would like to

01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,800
invite

01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,239
like if you have an idea of what you

01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,600
want um

01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,040
and then think about the other labels

01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,880
that you're not so sure about but you

01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,239
could discuss with the community

01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,159
so if you're not quite sure that you

01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:32,000
will be asking for things like design

01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:34,080
research because it seems like such a

01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,320
big thing that you're not ready for

01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,400
then maybe you can write it down and

01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,040
think about um having a conversation

01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,480
with the

01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,760
with people that can help you make that

01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,239
decision about whether it's the right

01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,880
design label to have or not

01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:48,239
again um one of the things uh that i

01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,120
just want to make sure that i say is

01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,520
that design

01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,040
is like development in a lot of ways in

01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,360
that there's a lot of jargon

01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,320
so i've got a couple of linked resources

01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,280
here um

01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,400
around design words and definitions that

01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,040
are really great

01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,800
resources for trying to explain terms

01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,560
that you might not be familiar with

01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,239
and to try and do that jargon busting

01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,199
exercise

01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:12,400
there's a couple of examples here from a

01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:14,400
repository

01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,560
that has a lot of design labels for each

01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:19,600
kind of different design function here

01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,080
through to one that has slightly less um

01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,920
and only ones that were were when they

01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:27,120
were needed were created

01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,000
right down to um a repo that is just

01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,239
starting out

01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,120
um with design contributions that just

01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:34,159
has a simple

01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:38,000
label of design an issue for designers

01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:41,040
and where they're using that as a um

01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,440
a way of inviting designers into

01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,719
a conversation about the other labels

01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,880
that they might need

01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:48,719
and what they would want to categorize

01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,920
things as

01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:55,920
um so i've got people asking for

01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,600
links um you can find a link to this

01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,440
mirror board

01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,719
so you should should be able to get

01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,080
access to

01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,239
this mirror board where you'll be able

01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:07,679
to access all the links on this

01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:08,000
these won't go away and you'll be able

01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,719
to

01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,560
click on them and uh take an exit out to

01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,360
the webpage so once you've got access to

01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,880
this um

01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,199
the board that i'm sharing at the moment

01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,320
you'll have access to all the links

01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,480
the last one that i'm going to go

01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:22,880
through really really quickly is

01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,719
around uh support communication and

01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:28,000
feedback for designers

01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,880
so one of the things that we often

01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,960
forget about when we're inviting design

01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,480
contributors specifically

01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,880
is um how are we setting up

01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:40,400
communication structures and feedback

01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,800
so some of the things to think about

01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:45,360
within this are do you have capacity

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,560
and interest in the team to guide

01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:49,040
designers

01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,320
so how much capacity if you do have it

01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,199
do you have to

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,080
help designers work through what they're

01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,320
working on

01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,199
on your open source do you have capacity

01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,440
to

01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:01,280
have design thinking exercises with them

01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,600
if they want to do some kind of workshop

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,800
around an issue or a future build

01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,719
do you have capacity to review what

01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,520
they're working on and do you have the

01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,560
interest in trying to learn how to best

01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,760
guide them

01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:18,480
towards a design solution

01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,480
do you need to recruit support for

01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,840
designers

01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:26,480
and then focus on more process so

01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,480
do you after asking the first question

01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,600
and you might not have capacity

01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,320
do you have a need to recruit design

01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,760
support

01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,000
so is the first thing that you want to

01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,000
start looking for is actually

01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,600
a feedback structure for the designers

01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,440
that are going to start contributing

01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,960
so what you're kind of asking yourself

01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,560
there is do you need a design

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,320
manager somebody that's going to manage

01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,400
the open source

01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,760
design contributions to some extent

01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,239
especially if you've got a larger

01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,239
project

01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,800
the next one is what kind of benefits

01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,480
can you plan in for designers and what

01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,880
are

01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,480
what what differences are there uh from

01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,480
code-based contributors

01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,000
for uh the kinds of benefits for

01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,159
designers have you

01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
so i added in a couple of examples here

01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,760
around have you got the ability to offer

01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,600
references for designers when they're

01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,280
applying for jobs or

01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,679
do you have the capacity and the um

01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,800
the ability to say yes designer once

01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,400
you've worked on this

01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,159
this open source project you can add

01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,880
that into your portfolio and you can use

01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:28,480
it to

01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,120
to seek work and work on other things

01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,960
can you do endorsements what can you do

01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:35,040
uh to make the designer

01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,880
um feel like they're getting something

01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,199
that helps them forward in their career

01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,120
by

01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:42,560
contributing to your open source

01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,159
or what kind of other benefits do you

01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,880
think the designer might want do they

01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:49,280
want

01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,800
um do they want to be able to

01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,639
see how their contributions are

01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,040
affecting positively the

01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,239
the the um tool that you're working on

01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,880
if it is at all

01:28:56,239 --> 01:29:00,239
how can you best put in place a way that

01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,600
the designers can find out

01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:07,360
how uh how their work is being enjoyed

01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:09,120
um or doing feedback

01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,400
so uh the last thing to say on

01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,520
communication um

01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,360
is uh they designers are

01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,199
somewhat a constrained resource at the

01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:20,080
moment and um

01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:22,639
most of them have uh most designers have

01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:26,239
worked solo as well as in small teams

01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:28,800
um there are some more that have worked

01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:30,639
across large teams and depending on what

01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,800
world of design you come from

01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,159
and your experience and expectations and

01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,920
needs are slightly different

01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,520
so somebody that's used to working in

01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,040
small teams might be more

01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,880
more comfortable with a small open

01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,400
source project and might not need a lot

01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,520
of communication

01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,199
um or a lot of um guidance um

01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,639
somebody that works solo really

01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,960
regularly might be really

01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:52,239
comfortable with say asynchronous

01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,040
written communication

01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,719
where somebody that's used to in-face

01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,960
in-person

01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,080
teams might be more used to more

01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,840
communication

01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,440
more video calls more things like that

01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,440
so how are you setting the expectations

01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,679
for the designers

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,480
and that most designers flourish with

01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,159
support

01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,840
and a community around them just like

01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:14,560
coders do

01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,480
um so the example that i've just got

01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,400
here is around one open source project

01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:21,199
that i'm part of and it's the

01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,560
uh slack channel that we have access to

01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:24,560
with a channel that is around

01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,480
designers and all the different work

01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:30,520
that the designers work on

01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:33,199
within that project and there are

01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:34,000
177 people interested in the design

01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,639
aspect of that

01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,080
open source project so you know there's

01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,679
a lot of different designers with a lot

01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,520
of different expectations and a lot of

01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,280
different communications needs there so

01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,960
have a think about how you can support

01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:48,880
the communication needs

01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:52,480
for your designers

01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:55,760
so um i've gone a little over

01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,480
time on the uh documentation side of

01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,400
things

01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:00,000
but what i'd like to do is just spend a

01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,040
couple of minutes on these

01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,800
um these last questions in the chat so

01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,400
if you've been furiously writing down

01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,120
answers to these questions or thinking

01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,560
of them

01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,480
uh with the intention of writing them

01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,880
down now now's a good chance to there's

01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,400
going to be a bit of silence

01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,920
but there's also a couple of other

01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,480
questions here that you can answer in

01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:21,360
the chat should you want to

01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:31,840
so have you ever had a designer feedback

01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:31,840
on your project and how did they do that

01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,120
this is this is the pause waiting for

01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,960
people to type in the chat

01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:59,840
if i don't get any that means that

01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:59,840
people have not had design feedback

01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:09,199
camille um you'll be able to find the um

01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:12,639
[Music]

01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:14,320
the slide with those links if you look

01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,560
for the section

01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,400
at the top which is called open source

01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:23,040
design documentation

01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:25,120
so it's quite a big document um i can

01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,400
make sure that you have access to the

01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,280
links afterwards but

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:33,120
um let me grab those dragon links for

01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,120
you now while people are thinking of

01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,120
the answers to whether or not they've

01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,840
had

01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,840
design feedback

01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,400
ah so there's there's actually there's a

01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:14,480
question for us so we do have a

01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,480
we have a q a section later on um

01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:19,199
and uh i'm just gonna copy paste that

01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:23,840
and make sure that we

01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:26,239
cover it later on

01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,199
so the question was what types of

01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,600
feedback have you

01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:30,719
have you received um that we can take

01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,840
back to our teams that

01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,880
helped us uh or was really negative to

01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,400
our careers so we'll definitely make

01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:40,639
sure that we answer that in the

01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,639
in the q a section a little later on

01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:45,040
uh the things uh the q a section will

01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,280
also be captured on the mirror board as

01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,280
well

01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,800
and uh camille don't worry too much

01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,600
we'll um when we move on to the next

01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,639
uh part of the mirror board we'll i'll

01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,960
make sure that i bring

01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,719
everyone's cursors to uh bring

01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:05,360
everyone's focus to where i am if you're

01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:08,639
if you're looking at the mirror board

01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,760
so the next question is um if you want

01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,159
to have a think about this or if you

01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,280
want to write something down in the chat

01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:16,719
is there one way that you can think

01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,120
is there one way you think you can

01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,679
improve your your docs

01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,960
um is it something that we covered in

01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:25,440
the section above

01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,960
or is it a new idea so from what we've

01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,639
just said is there something that you

01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:33,840
think that you can

01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:33,840
implement that will improve

01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,360
i hope so

01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,280
so i'll wait and see whether anything

01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,719
comes in the chat but just in the

01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,600
interest of time

01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,639
i'm going to ask the last question which

01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,560
is

01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,840
based off of the how to welcome

01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,480
designers

01:34:53,840 --> 01:35:01,840
what is your plan or ideas for being

01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:01,840
welcoming and planning communication

01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:15,840
do you have new information do you have

01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:15,840
ideas to take forward

01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:34,400
okay so uh

01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:38,080
just because of time we're gonna move on

01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:40,880
um but that was the um

01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,800
short section on design documentation

01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,440
and don't worry if that went a bit too

01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
quick for you

01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,159
or if it was a bit much with all the

01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,280
different questions you're not quite

01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,040
sure

01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,960
how exactly you want to start thinking

01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:52,719
about documentation all of the content

01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:56,960
is still here on the mirror board

01:35:52,719 --> 01:36:00,639
and you can browse it after the workshop

01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:04,239
as leisurely as you need to so

01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:07,920
i'm going to carry on

01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:11,840
with the next section

01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,960
which is about good first design

01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,760
issues and the quick thing that i'm

01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,880
gonna do

01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:21,760
to make sure everyone's with me

01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:25,840
on the board is i'm gonna bring everyone

01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,840
to me

01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,199
cool

01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:41,840
so uh if you need to uh take a break

01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,320
um please please feel free uh to take a

01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,159
break

01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:46,800
um i know that this is quite a long

01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,960
session um this is our our last

01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,840
section and our last group exercise that

01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,119
we'll be doing

01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:54,480
uh before the ending q a so we're going

01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:58,000
to talk a little bit about

01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:03,119
uh good first design issues now

01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:06,639
so um i hope that most folks are

01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:09,440
familiar with the idea of good first

01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:11,360
issues or community issues or things

01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:14,719
that are relatively easy

01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:17,280
for new contributors to pick up

01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,280
there is such a thing as good first

01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:22,960
design issues

01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:24,880
and we have over the months and years

01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,320
come up with a few different ideas of

01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,480
what we think

01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,600
are really good first design issues that

01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,440
you anybody

01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,960
regardless of where their open source

01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:36,000
project is

01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:38,239
um how advanced it is how new it is

01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,199
how much design contribution you've had

01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:42,400
in the past

01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:44,639
zero or some or loads

01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,560
a lot of these good first design issues

01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:49,280
are really great ones

01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,000
to have in your open source projects

01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,639
almost

01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,280
like permanently they don't tend to

01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,320
expire

01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,840
and they really only can improve your

01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,760
open source software and the

01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:03,119
contributions from designers

01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:06,080
uh by having them present there

01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,880
so you might have some ideas on what

01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,360
kind of help

01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,080
you want already from uh your designer

01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,000
so you might

01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,280
have a couple of issues in there already

01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,400
about we

01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,280
we want ui help or we want website help

01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,760
or we want

01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,480
graphics help or we want this particular

01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,080
help

01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:24,239
and that doesn't mean that you need to

01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,280
remove those those are perfectly fine to

01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,679
stay in there

01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,520
um but these can help those kinds of

01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:32,000
issues

01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,520
so these are also really really good uh

01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,239
for those who aren't

01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:38,560
sure where to start and who are looking

01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:41,119
for some ideas that have been tested

01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,480
elsewhere to try out so all of these uh

01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:44,719
good first design issues have been

01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,239
tested in different open source projects

01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,000
and they are ones that designers

01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:50,639
understand and

01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,119
respond well to and also give the open

01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,960
source

01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:56,960
some kind of value or benefit

01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,719
but these aren't the only good first

01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,440
design issues let them spark your

01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,880
imagination

01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,360
and see what you can ask from the open

01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,520
source community so i'm gonna

01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,679
go over the first few and then i'm gonna

01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,280
hand over to abby

01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,960
so the first thing i'm gonna do is

01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,320
another jump across the mirror board to

01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:16,239
prepare yourself

01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:17,520
for that so while mirror boards are

01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,320
really great for lots and lots of

01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,159
content

01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:23,040
for workshops they do it does get a bit

01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:24,800
disorientating when you hop around it

01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,880
so the first thing i'm going to do is

01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,040
bring everyone to me so that everyone

01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,800
has access to the section that i am

01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,000
looking at at the moment

01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,239
i'm just going to double check that

01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,520
folks are all here yep

01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:38,239
we're all here so the first one i'm

01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,440
going to talk

01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:42,639
about um is a something called a

01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:46,880
heuristic analysis

01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:49,040
or what we can call a ux review

01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,080
uh of your tool so your open source

01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,480
software

01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,360
and this is a really great good first

01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,560
design issue

01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,639
to add for user experience designers

01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,400
looking at finding opportunities to

01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,679
improve your open source

01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:05,119
by finding usability gaps that are

01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,960
difficult to find unless you are

01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:09,040
evaluating

01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,960
the open source software against a set

01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:14,400
of clear criteria

01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,320
and a heuristic analysis can be done uh

01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,920
like visually on design software so the

01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,760
designers that are contributing to this

01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,360
could do it in something like miro they

01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,280
could do it in something like photoshop

01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,679
they could do it in something like

01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,280
 or any kind of software that they

01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,639
they want to use but it can also be done

01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,199
in spreadsheets

01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,040
slide decks or written down in markdown

01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,880
tables so however i want a designer

01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,800
wants to

01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,480
offer the heuristic analysis and ux

01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,840
review there's

01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,159
loads of different ways that this can be

01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,560
contributed so it doesn't have to

01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:46,159
just purely be in one kind of software

01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,440
or one kind of tool

01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:49,520
and there are lots of ways to open

01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,080
source this process as well there's a

01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,320
really great

01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,840
article from nn group on how to do

01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:56,960
heuristic evaluation

01:40:53,840 --> 01:41:00,000
in fact uh this set of usability

01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,480
heuristics um what the the designers

01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,679
you'd

01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,760
use to guide them guide

01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,840
their heuristic analysis or their ux

01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:10,800
review um

01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,560
is available on that article link but

01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,480
essentially these are the different

01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,840
uh heuristics that the designers will

01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,960
look at when they're looking at the tool

01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,000
alongside it

01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,800
so they would think about linguistic

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,840
clarity

01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:26,639
so does an interface communicate as

01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,159
efficiently as possible and they will

01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,239
look at consistency

01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:31,920
so if there is an interface it doesn't

01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,600
always have to be about an interface for

01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,040
those of you that work on tools without

01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,119
interfaces

01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,040
is it consistent so you can change the

01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:39,360
word interface for anything to do with

01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,719
the

01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,199
you can change it for the open source

01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,320
software so is the open source software

01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:46,080
consistent

01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,360
and what they can do is use that as a

01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,960
heuristic to measure

01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:51,440
how they're how they're looking at the

01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:54,719
tool there's a great example

01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:58,320
article um just to the side here um uh

01:41:54,719 --> 01:42:00,080
where a designer has gone through a uh

01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,520
website with and done a heuristic

01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,000
analysis you can actually kind of see

01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,560
what this

01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,080
um could look like but just for your

01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,440
information it's not an open source tool

01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,320
that they've done this heuristic

01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,840
analysis on

01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,840
it's a regular tech tool but it's a

01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,040
really good example

01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,800
because i've been talking for a while

01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,760
i'm going to ask abby is there anything

01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,239
that you would like to

01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:21,280
mention on good fit issue of ux review

01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:21,280
and heuristic analysis

01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:28,480
um yeah it's generally like

01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,360
you know conducting a ux review and it

01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,440
might be a lot

01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,880
to take in just looking at all these

01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,360
different heuristics

01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,719
it's something that designers are more

01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,679
familiar with

01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:41,760
but you know going through them one by

01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:44,880
one you would be able to understand

01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,960
practically what each one is about um

01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,080
and see how you can apply that to your

01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,199
project as well

01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:53,280
so it's not rocket science it's also

01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,800
like something you can understand if you

01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,080
really put your mind to it but it's this

01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,920
is just to prepare

01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,360
you for the kind of contributions that

01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,280
designers

01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,800
are going to be making to your project

01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,040
and this is just to

01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,080
show you the value of you know this kind

01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:08,560
of um

01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,679
task or this kind of contribution and

01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,840
how that would

01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:15,679
really improve your project so yeah yeah

01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,960
and this is what you you worked on with

01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:19,760
mozilla right as well

01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,480
so that's definitely this is really

01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,760
close to

01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:25,280
that yeah so you can actually

01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,960
edit this as well it doesn't have to

01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:29,199
follow these heuristics you could

01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,159
um come up with heuristics uh that you

01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:32,000
want and

01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:33,679
uh are important to your open source as

01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,280
well so the important thing is that

01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,119
there are templates out there for you to

01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,480
add this is a good first issue

01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:43,360
and the rewards that you can have as a

01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:45,119
as a open source software based off of

01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,280
this activity are huge

01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:49,760
that you can identify huge gaps that can

01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:53,440
be improved

01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,360
the next one is something that um

01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:57,280
some of you might depending on whether

01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:00,000
you follow a person called brad frost

01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:03,760
very closely it might be familiar to you

01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,560
so brad frost um wrote about some

01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,400
something called an interface inventory

01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,880
a number of different years ago

01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,080
and i love this as a good first design

01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:15,360
issue because

01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:17,920
uh i don't think that um

01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:19,760
there's ever a bad time to do an

01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,639
interface inventory

01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,920
so this is really great for uh ui

01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:26,320
designers

01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,239
interface designers or visual designers

01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,719
and product designers so anybody that

01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:32,719
works with an interface or or if your

01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,960
tool has an interface as well

01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:36,480
so that's one of the criteria for this

01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,760
good first design issue is that your

01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:41,679
tool

01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,679
has to have some kind of interface

01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,560
so um what this uh what this is also

01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,560
really really good for i've just

01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,239
mentioned in the instructions as well

01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,880
it's really good if you've ever changed

01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:55,119
frameworks throughout the um

01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,000
throughout the life cycle of your uh

01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,760
open source

01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,280
software project so maybe you've changed

01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,440
from a certain framework

01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:03,920
you've upgraded to a different framework

01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,600
and this kind of exercise for designers

01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,480
can really pull out some of those

01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,600
places where the interface um ui

01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,000
elements

01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,719
do not quite look maybe as consistent as

01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,800
they should be

01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,760
or maybe there are things that a

01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,080
designer would

01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:20,080
improve that maybe uh the rest of the

01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,159
team haven't noticed yet

01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,280
and this is just a really also a really

01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:25,920
great um

01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,520
good first design issue for if you have

01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,840
an interface

01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,719
for your open source tool that it gets

01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,960
the designer

01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,400
really familiar with your tool as well

01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,239
because what they need to do is go

01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,000
through each part of the tool

01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:39,600
and screen grab all the different

01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,920
aspects of it and collect it in this

01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:45,920
interface inventory document

01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:48,239
um so uh

01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,199
i will talk uh so i've got another

01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:51,679
question i'm gonna

01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:53,520
put into the q a section uh afterwards

01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:55,119
as well so there was a question about

01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,360
example of a designer contribution to a

01:45:55,119 --> 01:46:00,159
project that does not have a ui

01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:01,679
so um that's a very interesting question

01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:03,199
we'll make sure that we cover it uh

01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,280
later on

01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,880
uh it's not impossible the quick answer

01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,920
is it's not impossible

01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,920
um for a designer to contribute to

01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,400
something that doesn't have a ui but it

01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,760
does mean that it's a bit more specific

01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,520
i would say the kind of design

01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:20,080
contribution

01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,600
so um this is just on screen at the

01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:24,320
moment just to finish the good first

01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,400
design issues is there is an example of

01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:28,080
the navigation section of an interface

01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,280
inventory for the good first design

01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,560
issue this is where

01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,719
um a tool has been screen grabbed

01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,600
um all the different kinds of ways of

01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,800
navigating

01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:41,199
around this um this website or this tool

01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,719
or this uh this open source software has

01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,920
been collected in this one place

01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,560
and when you do this you can really

01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,840
quickly see um where things are slightly

01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,880
different or where things can be

01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,880
improved uh

01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,480
those kinds of um those kinds of

01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,679
improvements can be made

01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:57,360
abby is there anything that you want to

01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,360
say about interface infantry

01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:01,360
yes i think um it's something that is

01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:03,520
really simple to do

01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:05,280
like it's a great design first issue

01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,400
because you know any designer

01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:10,400
can make this contribution and you know

01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,840
really add value to that project so

01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:15,199
it's really great yeah it's um

01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,040
a great one for the early career

01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:18,719
designers right so somebody that might

01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,639
not be as familiar with say design

01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,440
software or design processes might be a

01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,280
bit nervous

01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:28,000
this is a this is something that um

01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,360
has has very little requirements on like

01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,719
design skills in fact

01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,360
it's actually something really really

01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,719
good for a lot of people to practice

01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,400
actually regardless of whether you're a

01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:40,080
designer or not but

01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:42,000
i i every project that i work on

01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:43,119
open source or otherwise i always do an

01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,880
interface inventory

01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:48,880
on them the last one that i'm going to

01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:51,199
talk about is the sticker sheet or

01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,280
design ui system now this one gets a

01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:56,000
little bit um

01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,639
gets a little bit kind of uh meta in a

01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,800
way

01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,760
because uh why this is a good first

01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,920
design issue

01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,520
is um because it's really useful for the

01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,880
other designers that will contribute

01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:09,119
eventually

01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,080
so um what a sticker sheet or a design

01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,880
ui system

01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,840
is is there's a there's a few different

01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,520
ways that you could

01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,960
name this and i don't think that there's

01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:20,080
one single

01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:22,480
way of naming this artifact or this um

01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,480
design resource but i i tend to call it

01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:28,880
a sticker sheet

01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:30,080
it's um essentially a design file of

01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,880
some type

01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,560
can be any kind of um file that a

01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,239
designer has a preference for it could

01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,520
be in a proprietary software if they

01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,119
prefer or it could be an

01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,280
open source design tool if they do use

01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,760
that but as long as it's shareable in

01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,600
some

01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,440
capacity then that is one of the main

01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,679
criteria for a design

01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,480
sticker sheet for your open source

01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,119
software

01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,679
but essentially what it does is it is a

01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:54,800
design

01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,560
file of all the ui elements individually

01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:59,520
and as ecosystems so

01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,239
collections of ui elements and it should

01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,159
ideally

01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:07,040
also include pages of user flows

01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:08,239
um and as many of those different pages

01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,400
or

01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,360
views that you have that are possible to

01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,440
create

01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:15,599
so why this is really really useful and

01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:17,119
really really important is um

01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,800
a lot of designers when they come to

01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:21,440
contribute on a

01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,960
project will have to create these things

01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:26,000
from scratch if they want to

01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:28,080
um maybe the designer that wants to

01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,800
contribute doesn't necessarily have

01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,679
the kinds of skills to pull down a ui

01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,800
framework

01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,520
into into what they're using um you

01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,199
could also

01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:42,960
have this as a existing

01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:43,840
ui file so a lot of um a lot of design

01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,719
software's

01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:48,639
have like for example material google's

01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:52,320
material design as an existing

01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:54,159
um stock file in some of their software

01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,920
but what might have happened through the

01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:57,679
life cycle of your open source if you

01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:58,560
are using material design is that you

01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,920
might have changed

01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,760
certain components or you might use

01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,599
components in certain ways

01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,360
that you would not know unless you'd

01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:05,679
created these kinds of sticker sheets

01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,760
for

01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:09,679
for the other designers to work on and

01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,960
again like the interface inventory why

01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:12,960
this is really important

01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,320
is it gets one it gets your your

01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,840
designers um

01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:19,280
really um familiar with uh the

01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,920
open source software so that they're

01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:24,080
creating all these different views of it

01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,440
and it also builds your design community

01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,960
because they're doing that with the

01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,840
intention of sharing it with other

01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,000
designers

01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,239
and they're also uh the last one that i

01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,599
think is is that they're enabling design

01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:36,639
contributions

01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:40,800
um from other kinds of levels

01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:43,840
in the sense that um if a designer has

01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,840
been able to and has the skills to

01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,520
work with a framework maybe has some

01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,880
kinds of front-end skills or maybe a

01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,880
front-end

01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,280
contributor was able to help a designer

01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,280
by pulling down a ui system and kind of

01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:56,080
visualizing it for them in some kind of

01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:59,280
maybe

01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:01,040
um code based pattern library then if a

01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,679
designer is taking that and translating

01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,239
that into

01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,480
design files then you're enabling other

01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:08,400
designers to be able to work on the tool

01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,239
so you're not having that kind of single

01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,159
point of failure where every time a

01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:15,679
designer that wants to work on

01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:17,679
a new um part of your your tool

01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:19,119
needs to talk to somebody that can help

01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,000
with the front-end side of things or

01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:22,080
that has an environment

01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,920
set up that can do a screen share that

01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,719
can take screenshots all those kinds of

01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,440
things

01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,280
so the more um the more you encourage

01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:31,040
the designers to

01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,320
create these sticker sheets these

01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:36,000
resource files

01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:36,960
through open source um open source good

01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,239
first issues

01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,679
the better they're going to help the

01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,239
other designers that are coming after

01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:43,280
them do

01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:45,119
more work um abby anything you want to

01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,880
add here

01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:48,400
i think something that's really great

01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,599
with the sticker sheet is

01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,480
um it enables consistency you know with

01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,480
the design

01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:56,159
so if like designers are able to

01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:58,239
contribute to this and it just ensures

01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,800
that any other designer that's coming to

01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:01,119
add

01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,639
or make a ui contribution can easily

01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:04,400
just use the components that

01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,080
the other designers have created so that

01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:08,239
way the look and feel

01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,679
of your open source project is

01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:12,000
consistent and

01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,280
you know that's really great for you

01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,280
like the user experience

01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:19,599
overall yeah and designers get used to

01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,920
the idea of collaborating within this

01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:24,480
process as well right because

01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,520
uh sometimes a lot of well all the time

01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,199
when you're new to

01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:30,159
open source like every designer is going

01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:32,960
to be new to open source with a project

01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:33,599
the idea of collaboration on a single

01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:36,159
sort of

01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:38,239
tool from multiple different designers

01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:40,000
is quite a new concept for a lot of them

01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:41,679
so the more that you're encouraging them

01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,360
to do this kind of process within their

01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,800
good first design issues

01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,800
the better work they'll do

01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,800
collaboratively handing off

01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,480
issues between designers when they work

01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,119
on this process so

01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,400
um we probably haven't covered all the

01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,400
all the ways that all of these good

01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,760
first design issues will be good but we

01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,159
have tested

01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,840
a lot of these within communities and we

01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:05,360
can say that they they work

01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:08,320
incredibly well um i'm handing over to

01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,800
abby for the last good first design

01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:12,639
issue

01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,760
of empathy map and our last activity of

01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:16,960
the session

01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:19,280
take it away okay so

01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,440
um empathy maps are you know really

01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:24,159
great for user research designers

01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:26,800
um one of the questions we had that was

01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:28,800
nelly she is the user researcher

01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,480
and you know this this tool is like

01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,400
really great for her because

01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,920
you know it's something that you use to

01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,080
better understand

01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,840
the motivations and you know the drives

01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:39,440
of the people who use your products or

01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:42,800
who use your platform

01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:44,560
um so it's usually something like this

01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,760
like a word you can have it from paper

01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,400
you can have it

01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:50,480
um you know sticky notes or something

01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:53,440
but it's usually divided into segments

01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:56,320
and you're trying to really get into the

01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:59,040
personality of the person or the user

01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,599
of the product and you want to know what

01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,719
they

01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:04,719
say you know common things that they say

01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,159
maybe during an interview or your normal

01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:07,520
interactions with them

01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:09,280
what are some of the things that they

01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,639
say or they think about things that

01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,320
occupy their thoughts

01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:15,119
it could also be things that they are

01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:17,119
not um willingly

01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:19,119
want like they would not want to stay

01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:20,239
you know voluntary you want to find out

01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:23,440
what

01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:25,360
the issue could be you know

01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:27,360
so you can also talk about what they

01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,239
hear um and see common things around

01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,599
them that you think

01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:33,360
would affect their experience or um just

01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:36,320
the way they go through

01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:38,480
um the usage of your application you can

01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:40,080
also consider the things that they do

01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,920
you know on a regular basis some common

01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:45,760
things or some random things

01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:48,480
that you probably observe them doing

01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,000
and definitely you can always get

01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,480
insights from those kinds of

01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,920
things because you would know okay what

01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,679
are the kinds of things that

01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,040
the people who use your products are

01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,400
used to and

01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:01,360
that could definitely um be used to

01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,000
improve the experience of your

01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,480
application and then you could also take

01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,599
a look

01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:08,560
at um how they feel how they feel like

01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:10,719
their emotions

01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,159
and um usually like the things that

01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:14,159
affect them things that make them

01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:16,320
make them feel the way that they do so

01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:18,800
this is a sample empathy map

01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:21,440
for a user of the resilience app which

01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:24,480
is an open source tool for organizing

01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,119
um voluntary efforts to provide mutual

01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,560
aid

01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:28,880
and you can see in the middle we have

01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,080
like a new user like we're looking at a

01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,639
single persona

01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,560
a new user when i say persona i mean

01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:37,199
like a user group so

01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,239
um indesign you can have different kinds

01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:40,239
of people

01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:41,760
using your application so just as i

01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:43,760
mentioned this is for

01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,080
mutual aid there are people offering

01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,000
help and they're people receiving help

01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,920
so those are like two different kinds of

01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,480
people through user groups

01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:56,719
and this is one of them

01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:58,080
um so some common things they hear you

01:55:56,719 --> 01:55:58,800
know they get from family friends you

01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,239
can help

01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,239
they hear you know if they have the

01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:03,440
application it goes off and they hear

01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:05,119
like alert

01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:06,800
these are things that you can you know

01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:08,320
have on your empathy map

01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,560
what are some things that they say

01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:11,440
probably things like um i need help this

01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,080
month because

01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:15,599
i lost my second job i need some quick

01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,119
food to feed the kids

01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:21,199
um or they asking who can help me

01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:23,280
where can they find help these might be

01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:25,760
things that you have heard them say

01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,520
so this is an example for a particular

01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,080
project it would definitely be different

01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,320
for

01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:32,080
for each different um open source

01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:33,840
project but it's really good to have

01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,719
something like this because it helps you

01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,960
to really put your

01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:38,639
yourself in the shoes of the people who

01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,800
are going to be using your platform

01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,320
and you don't need to have any special

01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:44,719
um talent

01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:46,320
it's just about empathizing with these

01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:48,800
people because when you do you're able

01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,639
to design and develop solutions for them

01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:52,639
that would appeal to them and that would

01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,679
hopefully solve their problem

01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,960
so that is a summary of what the empathy

01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:00,880
map looks like

01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:10,480
ariel could you go back to the slide

01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:14,159
so we could continue with that

01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,199
okay great so empathy mapping really

01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:18,000
just helps

01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:18,800
you and your team to um articulate them

01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,719
just have

01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,800
in a single place everything you already

01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:23,520
know about the users of your product or

01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,440
your platform

01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,360
so it's like a single source of truth

01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:30,400
something you can always refer to

01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:33,679
and have shared understandings of

01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:35,760
um the users of your product

01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,800
and it also it also helps when you make

01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,400
decisions especially

01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,080
when it comes to features things you'd

01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,040
like to add or remove things you're

01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:43,360
considering

01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:45,119
um and then you can consider as i said

01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:48,159
before what the user says

01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:51,119
what the user does thinks feels

01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:52,719
hears and sees and additionally some

01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:53,920
people like to add this also in the

01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:56,639
empathy maps

01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,679
what the goals of the users are and what

01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,679
their pains are

01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:00,880
so their goals are like you know things

01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:04,080
that they want

01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,360
their motivations what drives them and

01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:07,760
you know when you really know what

01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,520
drives these people then you can design

01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:12,400
your solution and you can

01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,880
develop your your platform to achieve

01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,920
those

01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,239
those goals for them um and then it's

01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,400
also

01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:20,320
important to know their pains like their

01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:23,360
frustrations and anxiety

01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:25,840
design is about solving problems and

01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,800
technology is about making life easier

01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:29,520
so when you know

01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:31,199
what pains these people have um then you

01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,320
can better

01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:36,880
solve those issues with your product

01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:38,080
so as mentioned before the example shows

01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,119
an empathy map

01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:42,880
for a new user of the resilience app and

01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:47,040
our second activity

01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:49,840
is here um we're going to be looking at

01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:52,159
how we can demonstrate empathy maps how

01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,920
we can create an empathy map for our

01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:57,599
open source project

01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,480
so um for this activity we're going to

01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:02,480
be going back

01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:05,119
to our our team and our groups

01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,520
and each group is going to need to focus

01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:09,119
on

01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:11,199
one oss project that at least one person

01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,840
in the group is familiar with it's okay

01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,920
if

01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,000
um you don't own an open source project

01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,920
yourself or if you haven't contributed

01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,560
to one yourself but if there's anyone on

01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:22,400
the group who has the experience

01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:24,159
and would like to talk about it then the

01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:27,119
group can focus on that project

01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,920
and they can maybe you know interview

01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:29,920
that person

01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:31,679
try to find out as much as possible so

01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,599
they can understand

01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,760
basically who the typical user of that

01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,119
project or platform is

01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,440
and then when you have that

01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:42,639
understanding of who that person is

01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:44,159
then you can really try to imagine or to

01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,920
put yourself in your shoes

01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:47,199
and think about things that they would

01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,560
normally hear

01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:54,400
see say think

01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:56,800
feel um and everything else so

01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,159
you can you can ask questions like this

01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,960
have you met

01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:02,080
someone like this before um what kind of

02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:04,719
comments have you

02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,119
heard them say about the project what

02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,280
kind of

02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:09,199
emotions or feelings do you think you

02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,000
know that that you've sensed from these

02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:12,000
people

02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
when they engage with your product or

02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,239
your your your project

02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,040
and then what actions do they regularly

02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:18,719
take

02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,880
that you have observed maybe you've

02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:22,239
noticed that instead of signing in with

02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,560
their email they would rather start

02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:26,000
signing with google or facebook that's

02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,400
just an example

02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,599
um so these are like questions that

02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:32,880
really help you to

02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:33,280
get to think about the user and we have

02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,360
the

02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:39,520
sample empathy maps um they're empty

02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,360
on the board we have an example here

02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:43,679
that you can always refer to i had one

02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,400
example in the slide and this is another

02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:48,080
one

02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:49,520
for a new contributor to the mozilla

02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:51,360
project like

02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,199
imagine someone who is contributing to

02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:55,599
mozilla for the first time

02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:56,719
what are some things that they hear and

02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:59,360
see and say and

02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,480
do and feel and think about so this is

02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,400
just like something

02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:05,119
you can refer to while you are building

02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:07,840
out your own empathy maps for your own

02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:08,239
selected open source project so if you

02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:11,440
look

02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:13,280
on the on the board you would see

02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,960
that we have the empathy maps for

02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:18,560
different groups

02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:21,760
group one two three four and five

02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:22,159
um same way we did the last activity you

02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,480
can

02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:25,679
click to type your name and then you can

02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:29,440
just drag

02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:31,599
or create a text box and typing whatever

02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:33,040
you feel is relevant that is after your

02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:36,480
conversations with

02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:38,719
you know the people in your group so

02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,520
ariel is demonstrating how you can do

02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:42,880
that

02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:44,800
yes so um we still have the same groups

02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,599
nothing has changed please look for the

02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,840
link

02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:52,239
to your your gypsy group

02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:54,800
um and yes we'll be heading over

02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:57,040
i and arrow will head over to the

02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,440
different groups to see how you're doing

02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:01,040
so we're going to be on mute here and

02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:03,920
we'll be active

02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:04,719
yeah so just a quick reminder for those

02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,520
of you

02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:09,440
uh who were assigned to groups before if

02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:12,560
you've joined us

02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:13,920
after groups were assigned um

02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:16,080
you can head into one of these group

02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:19,199
rooms um

02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:20,800
we've not got um as many a mini

02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:24,159
attendees um anymore

02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,719
so if you want to um click on the

02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:27,199
gypsy link uh which you should be able

02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:29,280
to

02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:30,800
uh get access to actually do you know

02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,040
what i'll do just uh

02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,159
just to make things a little bit easier

02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,440
i'm going to pop

02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:40,800
both of these gypsy room links just

02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:43,920
in our zoom chat so um

02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:46,639
we've got 18 people still on the call so

02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:48,639
if we make sure that we split relatively

02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,159
evenly if you want to go into a room

02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,560
if you see that the room is a little bit

02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:55,920
full maybe pop into the other one

02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,840
but you know if you are named on the

02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,760
group one and you're still around please

02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:01,840
go into the group that you were

02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:03,360
in before and stick there but maybe

02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,320
there might be some new faces there as

02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,920
well

02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,560
um so for group number one the gypsy

02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:14,639
room

02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:18,080
is in the zoom chat

02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:22,159
for group number two i'm just popping

02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:24,320
the gypsy room in the chat now um

02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:25,920
we're going to mute here on zoom so not

02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,320
a lot is going to be happening here on

02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,560
zoom

02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:30,239
everything's going to be going on in the

02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:34,239
gypsy rooms

02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:37,440
uh we'll come back uh

02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:39,840
um just gone half past the

02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,800
hour so we've got about 10 or 15 minutes

02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:42,960
on the empathy map

02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,199
exercises and me and abby will be in the

02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,480
rooms to help you

02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:51,840
cool okay so folks should be

02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:54,079
coming back from their uh group jitsi

02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:58,000
room

02:03:54,079 --> 02:04:01,040
so um i'm just gonna make sure that

02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,560
everyone that's still in the mirror

02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,719
board is looking at the same

02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:06,960
uh thing that i'm looking at so we had

02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:08,719
one group

02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,159
working on this activity of an empathy

02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:12,320
map and

02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:14,000
abby do you want to do you want to round

02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:16,639
up this last activity for us

02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,400
and uh take us towards the finishing

02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:21,679
line

02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:23,360
yes we just have a few minutes left but

02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,719
it was it was really exciting the

02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,320
activities to see

02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:28,239
you know i was building up an

02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:31,119
interesting map and

02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:32,480
discovering behaviors of users that we

02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:34,480
only just imagined so

02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,599
just just imagine what could happen when

02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:39,119
you're actually doing

02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:40,000
real users and different other projects

02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:43,360
so

02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:46,719
this is uh just a report you can chat

02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:49,440
and just say if you feel an empathy map

02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:51,840
is a good first design issue

02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,560
just let us know and tell us why you

02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:55,199
think

02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,480
it is good or it is not good and you can

02:04:55,199 --> 02:05:00,000
also tell us what you find

02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:02,239
interesting about empathy math um

02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,040
so you should just leave us a chat but

02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:08,000
that is it for the ssd mapping

02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:10,239
and we'll be going to q a right about

02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,239
now

02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:17,840
yeah so we're really curious about um

02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:19,440
the folks that were participating in the

02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:22,159
empathy map you know

02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,560
we we expressed what we were learning

02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:25,119
there

02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,320
which was great um for the folks that

02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:27,760
weren't in the room

02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,360
take a look at the empathy map on the

02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,960
mirror board have a have an explore

02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,159
around the mirror board and have a read

02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,500
of the things that were

02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:35,920
being written down and

02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:38,480
[Music]

02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:40,239
have a think about how an empathy map

02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,520
and the process of an empathy map as a

02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:43,760
good first design issue

02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,880
what it can do for you and the the open

02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:47,840
source

02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,280
uh that you're working with um and i

02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,000
think one of the key things that i just

02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:53,280
want to

02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,599
wrap up on with with embassy mapping

02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:56,880
is that the idea of participating in

02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:59,520
writing an empathy map

02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:00,320
in this workshop wasn't to become

02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,960
experts at

02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:08,719
writing empathy maps ourselves but to

02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:11,360
get an idea of what kinds of

02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:13,760
design contributions through the good

02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:17,920
first issue of an empathy map will

02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:20,239
will give us so if you now decide

02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:20,960
after this workshop i'm going to create

02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:23,760
a

02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:25,599
an issue a good first design issue in

02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,920
our open source repository

02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:30,079
which is an empathy map create for us an

02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,560
empathy map about our users

02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:33,599
that you have at least an idea of what

02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:35,360
to expect

02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:36,719
back from designers when they start to

02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:39,679
make that contribution

02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:41,599
and that was really the main aim of this

02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,719
exercise was to prepare you

02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:46,079
for those contributions more than make

02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,800
you experts on

02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:48,800
empathy mapping

02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:54,400
um so we've got a few minutes left we

02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:57,760
did have a few questions already

02:06:54,400 --> 02:07:00,639
so um let's uh make sure that those are

02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:02,560
answered before we finish

02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:04,880
the two questions that were asked a

02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:07,199
little earlier on in the session were

02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:09,440
um what types of feedback have you

02:07:07,199 --> 02:07:12,719
received me and abby

02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:14,480
that we can take back to the

02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:16,560
you as the attendees can take back to

02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:18,560
your teams that really helped us

02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,760
or was also really negative to our

02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,040
careers so

02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,679
abby have you got anything that you can

02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:24,960
think of off the top of your head um

02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:26,800
feedback that you've received as a

02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:29,360
designer in open source and maybe things

02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:32,639
that weren't cigarette

02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:34,880
okay so um at first i i

02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:36,960
with the world community i actually

02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,639
applied to be a designer

02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,800
you know to make design contributions

02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:42,880
but i was assigned something else

02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,480
that was quality assurance and it was it

02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:47,840
was very very different

02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:48,400
um but i did my best and um it was a

02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,599
little

02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:53,520
um not what i expected but

02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:55,360
i continued to make divine contributions

02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,679
um you know with mozilla

02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:58,800
it was really friendly and they just

02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:00,400
kept acting like

02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,840
trying to challenge you know different

02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,840
ways of thinking so

02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,079
if if you know you're assigned something

02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,079
else to like someone who's looking to

02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:08,880
contribute and it's not like what they

02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,639
expected

02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:12,000
you can try to encourage them to do

02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:14,159
something that they're more comfortable

02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,159
with

02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:25,360
um negative to my career

02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:28,800
um nothing nothing that

02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:30,719
well i mean i don't know uh maybe i've

02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:32,400
made some terrible enemies in the open

02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:35,440
source projects that i've worked on

02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,679
um i hope not but um there

02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:39,280
have definitely been challenges in being

02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:41,840
a designer in open source that

02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:42,800
aren't necessarily negative to my career

02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,920
but um

02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:47,440
you know there are things that i expect

02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:48,239
now because i've been here for a little

02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,040
while but

02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:51,840
i um had i had a project that i was

02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:53,440
working on

02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:55,760
the first thing that i needed to do was

02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:57,920
create a logo an identity for this open

02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,880
source project that was completely new

02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:03,040
never it was completely new project

02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:06,480
logos are a really tricky thing

02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:07,760
because you want to be as inclusive as

02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,760
possible with everyone

02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:10,880
and involve everyone in the logo design

02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:13,920
process

02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,960
but that often means that you could

02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,960
spend months

02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,119
and years working on logo designs and

02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:22,239
not actually settle on something

02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:24,639
so i now know as a designer to

02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:25,440
when to call it um when to call it

02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,639
basically

02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:31,360
this is enough discussion on this um

02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:31,679
logo design i recommend you go with this

02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,360
one

02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,119
even though these people in the

02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:37,599
community might not like

02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:38,800
it for these reasons this one meets the

02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:39,920
the need

02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,679
i think that that can be really

02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:42,880
challenging and it can be a negative

02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:46,560
experience

02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,639
as a designer in open source to

02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,079
want to be inclusive and want to give

02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:53,360
your expertise

02:09:50,079 --> 02:09:56,159
but then to um

02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:57,760
not be able to you can't always

02:09:56,159 --> 02:10:00,079
incorporate everyone's ideas and

02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:02,159
everyone's um

02:10:00,079 --> 02:10:03,679
opinions in in pieces of design work and

02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:06,079
i think that's sometimes

02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,760
one of the things that is really hardest

02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:11,040
for designers to

02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:14,079
in open source projects to balance

02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:16,079
because typically you don't get paid

02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:18,000
and it's hard work trying to include

02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:21,920
everyone's voice and also

02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:24,480
help people understand what kind of um

02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,159
uh feedback for something like a piece

02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:29,520
of design work is really useful

02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:32,800
and and um yeah so not necessarily

02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:32,800
negative to my career but

02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:40,400
but yeah i've definitely been uh not

02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:42,000
you know not the most uh what's the word

02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:43,679
i've definitely been very opinionated as

02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,800
well within open source projects

02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:49,440
and you know i'm sure that

02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:51,920
some open source projects would have

02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:55,360
preferred a softer approach so

02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:59,360
probably not negative but probably not

02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:00,800
ideal um the next question was uh

02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:02,320
and we might have a few more coming in

02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,599
the chat if you've got questions for us

02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:05,679
please um pop them

02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:07,040
in either the chat with the q a function

02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:08,320
i'm just going to pop up the q a

02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,599
function now because i haven't seen it

02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:12,480
until now

02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:14,079
um so uh can you give an example of a

02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:16,159
designer contribution to a project that

02:11:14,079 --> 02:11:18,960
doesn't have a ui abby have you got any

02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:21,920
examples of this i i have like one but

02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:24,560
it's a tough question

02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,679
i'm thinking um it could be the stage

02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:28,560
that the project is at

02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:29,199
like is it never going to happen ui um

02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:31,280
so if

02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:34,079
like the person you know or the team is

02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,760
looking to still have ui contributions

02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:37,040
um then that could something that could

02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,360
be something you could encourage you

02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,079
know

02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:40,560
for someone to feel the sticker sheets

02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:43,520
or

02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:44,480
some sketches or give some design

02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,960
concept

02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:48,880
um but if not then there can be some

02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:51,119
user studies you might just really want

02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:54,800
to understand more about the users

02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:57,840
and do something um an interaction

02:11:54,800 --> 02:12:00,400
system that works like without a

02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:01,679
visual interface so i would suggest the

02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:05,520
user

02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:07,280
study yeah something like that

02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,040
yeah abby raises an amazing point i

02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,480
didn't i didn't even realize like not

02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:12,880
every project

02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:13,520
start well no projects start with the ui

02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,119
i don't think

02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:16,800
every project sort of starts with an

02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:19,520
idea um

02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,400
or at the very least sometimes they move

02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:21,760
in parallel

02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:23,520
like sometimes you're building and

02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:27,040
developing a ui

02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:28,800
or something alongside the ideas so

02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:30,960
the only other example that i have is i

02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,760
had a very long and very interesting

02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:35,760
conversation about how

02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,679
there was an open source tool or open

02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,760
source project that was

02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,440
interactive interacted with purely in

02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:45,040
the terminal window

02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:46,800
and um you know a person said to me

02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:48,560
there's no design needed in the terminal

02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,880
window and i said aha

02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:52,560
but there it is the terminal window is

02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,079
actually a great place for a design

02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:55,040
because you can do something which is

02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:57,840
called

02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:59,199
uh ux copy design or basically just

02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,320
narrative design

02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:05,440
it's basically how you design

02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:05,840
text and how you design phrases and how

02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:09,119
you

02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:11,040
you build the story around something so

02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:12,800
you can engage with designers that have

02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:16,400
a background in

02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,360
narrative and copywriting to engage them

02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:20,480
in projects that are

02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:22,880
purely text-based what is this command

02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:24,639
telling our developers uh what do we

02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:27,840
actually want to encourage them to do

02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:29,280
do we want to um do we want to enhance

02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:31,679
the experience of using

02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,960
our our open source through the terminal

02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:34,480
in a slightly different way do we want

02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:37,280
to even explore that

02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:38,639
um so yeah there even though you might

02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,679
not think

02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:41,119
you might think that there are places

02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:41,920
where design doesn't touch they're

02:13:41,119 --> 02:13:43,599
actually

02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:45,280
sometimes you can discover really

02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:47,599
surprising and interesting projects

02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:50,639
uh through engaging a designer in those

02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,639
kinds of conversations

02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:56,159
uh so there's another question that

02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,280
we're a little

02:13:56,159 --> 02:14:00,800
we've actually gone over time um

02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:03,440
maybe we'll answer this last one real

02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,440
quick um and then ben will kick us out

02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:06,639
uh

02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:08,320
what are the top three things you would

02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:09,599
tell a development team or any

02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:11,040
development team to get them thinking

02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:13,199
about designers and designing their

02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:15,840
organization and projects

02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:15,840
um abby

02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:23,920
um so i would tell them you know

02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:26,800
designers

02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:28,400
want to do good designers who actually

02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:30,800
want to contribute

02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:32,000
they just might not know how so just

02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:35,760
remembering that

02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,320
can help you really go the extra mile to

02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:38,960
think of

02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:40,320
how you can welcome your designers

02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:41,920
designers who want to contribute to your

02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:44,639
project and we already looked at that

02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:47,119
in an area activity so that is one thing

02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:47,119
i would say

02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:52,400
yeah the top three things um

02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:56,159
[Music]

02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:57,520
the first one is that the same as abby's

02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:59,599
designers

02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,520
they are out there not every designer

02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:02,960
wants to contribute but there are enough

02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:05,280
designers out there that want to

02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:08,920
contribute in so many different ways

02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:11,040
and a lot of them are these kinds of

02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,800
groundbreaking because we're it's still

02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:15,840
early in the days of

02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:17,119
i think open source design involvement

02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,360
and contribution

02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:21,040
there's not a lot of us active there's

02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:22,639
not a lot of us doing the advocacy work

02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:24,639
but we're building up our numbers and

02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:26,079
we're building up our community

02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:27,520
so the first thing is that they are

02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,840
there and they really want to help and

02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:30,960
they

02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:34,400
just need that pathway in and

02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:36,079
sadly not all of them will know how to

02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,840
build that pathway themselves

02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:39,840
or have support to build that pathway

02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:41,679
themselves so the more that you can do

02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,480
as a development team to build

02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:46,960
any kind of pathway any kind of olive

02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:51,199
branch out to the design community

02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:52,639
is a plus to the general community for

02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:55,920
open source

02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:57,760
um try

02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:59,360
if you have access to designers or

02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:01,119
conversations with them

02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:03,440
try and talk to designers about the

02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:06,159
issues that you face as open source

02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:08,000
i think a lot of coders or open source

02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:08,880
maintainers kind of automatically assume

02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,639
that designers

02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,480
aren't really interested in some of the

02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:15,920
open source

02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:18,800
topics of interest like licensing or

02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:20,079
um you know community based sides of

02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:23,520
things or even like

02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:27,360
uh code hygiene and things like that um

02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:30,079
i have to admit i'm i'm less uh

02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:31,280
proficient in this sort of code hygiene

02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:33,280
pr hygiene

02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:36,240
these kinds of things than i am the

02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:39,040
community and um

02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:39,840
um the other aspects of open source but

02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:42,319
i am

02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:44,960
hugely interested in licensing and i'm

02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:47,519
hugely interested in how licensing can

02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:48,639
can be more inclusive of different kinds

02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,240
of functions

02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:51,840
so talk to designers about the kinds of

02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:54,000
things that you are thinking about

02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,679
in the open source community and try and

02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,840
um

02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:59,840
try and practice i guess if you're

02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:04,319
familiar with the term rubber ducking

02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:06,719
try and like rubber duck uh your

02:17:04,319 --> 02:17:08,000
kinds of topics with with them just you

02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:09,840
know make sure that

02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,200
they can ask questions and clarification

02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:13,439
and that you can go

02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,479
somewhat back to basics but also don't

02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:16,080
assume that

02:17:14,479 --> 02:17:17,840
it's all about the basics that some

02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:18,719
designers have actually come from a code

02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:22,319
background so

02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:24,399
you never know um and the yeah the last

02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:26,479
thing is that not all design is visual

02:17:24,399 --> 02:17:28,399
and not all design is ui and not all

02:17:26,479 --> 02:17:31,040
design is logos and

02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:32,719
um i think the best one of the best

02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:36,559
things that could be done

02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:39,599
soon is a better understanding of the

02:17:36,559 --> 02:17:40,840
variety that design can bring to open

02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:44,399
source

02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:46,160
beyond logo design beyond ui design

02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:47,840
beyond design systems these are all

02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:49,280
great things and they're fantastic and i

02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,439
love working on them

02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:53,359
but the more that we engage with

02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:57,200
designers of all kinds

02:17:53,359 --> 02:18:00,559
the more will be more well-rounded

02:17:57,200 --> 02:18:02,080
in our open source software projects um

02:18:00,559 --> 02:18:03,760
and hopefully we'll start to build

02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:05,920
bridges for product

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,960
people and product managers to start

02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:10,800
their own

02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:14,800
uh venture into open source territory

02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:18,399
um we're

02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,519
at the end we thank you for everyone

02:18:18,399 --> 02:18:20,880

02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:54,319
us encouraging more

02:18:52,479 --> 02:18:56,000
design contributions in our first

02:18:54,319 --> 02:18:59,120
project

02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,240
yeah thank you everyone and thank you to

for having us even with a

02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:09,679
slightly challenging way of delivering

02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:18,080
this kind of workshop so yeah thank you

02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:18,080
