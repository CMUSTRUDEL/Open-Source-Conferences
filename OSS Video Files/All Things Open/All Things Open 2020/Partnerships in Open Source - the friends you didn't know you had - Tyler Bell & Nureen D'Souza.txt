Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Sponsor Spotlight Track (Day 1)

Abstract: In the past two years, we've seen deterioration of the barrier between financial services and the open source community increase exponentially. Usage, contribution, and even creation of Open Source Software by large, heavily regulated companies are becoming ingrained in the fiber of corporate SDLC. The nature of this shift is equally technical and cultural, with each dimension of open source bringing its own host of challenges -- security, legal, risk, and compliance.

Capital One will share it's five year journey to become an "open source first" company, and the relationships, both internal and external, that made this vision a reality. This transformation was a significant, multi-year effort that required every part of the business to come along on the journey. We’ll share what we’ve done and how we’re incorporating our lessons learned into our open source contribution and community processes. In this session, you’ll learn how we are transforming our organization with open source collaboration and we hope this will help you in your own journey.

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,279
just over three years working working in

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:20,240
our open source program office

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
hey uh good afternoon so greetings from

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
open source program office at capital

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
one

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
my name is noreen de souza i'm a product

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
and engineering lead to help

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
drive the open source program office

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
mission as part of my

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,079
role i get to partner with a risk legal

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
brand

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,200
and engineering teams across the

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,600
organization and

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120
external development community about all

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,719
things open

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,480
so that includes use of open source

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
components contributing back

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,559
and launching open source projects i

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
have been with capital one for six years

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
and worked in different areas

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
wherein i had the opportunity to drive

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,760
adoption on a devops and you build it

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
you only

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
methodologies and one thing is very

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
apparent

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
uh partnership and collaboration is key

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,720
to meeting

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,320
um your strategic goals and you will

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,119
hear more about this throughout our

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
presentation

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,960
i'm excited to be here along with my

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,360
colleague tyler

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,360
awesome thanks serene so folks i want to

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
open up with a quote from

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,479
red hat state of enterprise open source

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
report

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,320
um and it's at 86 percent of it leaders

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
say that the most innovative companies

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,360
are using enterprise open source

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
around 2015 uh capital one declared that

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
they wanted to operate more like a tech

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,439
company

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
and the the quote that i like to share

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
is that

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,400
um even though we are not a traditional

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,079
technology company

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
we'd like to build the kind of bank that

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,560
a technology company would build

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,399
and when you see statistics like these

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
you can understand why open source is so

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
critical to that mission

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
so with that i'll pass this over to

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
noreen to go over a brief history

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,159
of open source at capital one in our

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,640
technology journey

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
thanks tyler so you may already know

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
that capital one is one of the largest

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,840
digital banks with regional footprints

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,360
in the us and has a large credit card

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,480
portfolio in the u.s

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
canada and uk with millions of accounts

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,440
you may not be aware of but capital one

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,160
is a founder like technology company

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
from the day we were found capital one

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,080
has been disruptive in many ways

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
so open source and devops have

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
contributed to that

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
success despite the regulated industry

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,879
in which we operate

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,959
so a journey is a marathon to becoming a

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,560
well-managed open source company

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,680
we first had to learn to crawl walk and

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,239
and then run so what did i when

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,840
and how did it all start right open

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
source is a shiny object

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,800
hard to resist offers benefits that go

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,360
beyond the cost of developing it

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
so what did your strategy look like

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
right you might be all thinking

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
so we met with different companies

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,879
survey the landscape to understand the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,519
industry benchmarks

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,080
and put together a strategy that which

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
we call

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
open source psp that stands for policy

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,480
standard and

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,200
procedure document that is laid out from

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,920
soup to nuts in other words a manifesto

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,319
on our strategy to embrace open source

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
in a responsible way at capital one

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,400
so did we get this right the first time

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
of course not

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
we also started uh with the not so

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,200
perfect process

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,480
and iterated through it over time so in

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,720
2013 we started with a manual approval

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
from legal and security to use open

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
source software

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
and had mostly waterfall deployments in

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,200
other words we were crawling

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,640
literally and with our manual processes

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
so between 2015 and 2019 we focused on

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,319
scaling

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
devops on our continuous and on our

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
continuous delivery pipeline

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,760
and improved our releases frequency to

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,480
10 plus a day for some applications

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,480
built and deployed on public cloud using

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
microservices architecture

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,159
we announced open open source first and

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
cloud first

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,480
led innovations contributed externally

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,720
and launched open source projects

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,959
so in a highly regulated environment if

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
you're not doing continuous delivery

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,239
then our belief is that you're not

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
compliant enough

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,759
so to reduce vulnerabilities and license

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
violation

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
you must release incrementally and in a

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
small batches

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
so throughout this journey we measured

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
improved matured

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
partnered and collaborated in our

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
practices as a result today

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
we're able to enhance the quality of our

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,840
controls within our ci cd pipeline

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
double down on our contributions

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,800
externally

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,400
and make capital one a stronger player

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
across the tech industry

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,199
which has led to interesting development

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,680
outside capital one and tyler will go

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
with them

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,160
thanks noreen um folks as noreen

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,919
mentioned um we've been able to open

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
source a number of projects

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,000
from capital one developers two of those

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,160
projects are flagship products

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
cloud custody and hygiena and clock

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
custodian is a rules engine that helps

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,400
you manage your aws resources

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
iga is a devops metrics dashboard that

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,960
helps teams

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
value stream the effectiveness of their

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,680
devops and in addition to these projects

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
we have about 20 additional projects

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,919
in the capital one github and we've seen

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
literally thousands of contributions

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,120
from our engineers

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
to hundreds of projects outside of

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
capital one so

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
we're really proud that we've been able

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,720
to include external contribution

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
as part of the bau for our developers

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,680
capital one

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
and i'll pass this back to noreen to

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,039
talk about some of our partners

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,240
yeah so what is key to our success right

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
and that is the talk um is all focused

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
about

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,560
partnerships in open source the friends

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
you don't know

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,960
you had we call them the avengers um

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
jokes apart so

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,319
how many of you all have had instances

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
where you

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,600
your risk or legal partners have

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
concerns

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
and you had to pull back your release so

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
we faced that too

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
so before open source program office was

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,520
established

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,800
engineering teams didn't speak to legal

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
or risk teams but

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
certainly had umpteen open source

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,520
libraries that needed approvals

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,039
prior to use or releasing them

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
engineering teams didn't

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,880
sit with risk or legal or brand partners

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
to understand risk

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
or license implications and vice versa

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319
legal

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
didn't understand open source software

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,280
and products were the realization

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
of the importance of partnership has led

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
to the success of open source so three

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
things

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,479
to to keep this in mind and more so as a

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,560
takeaway

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,720
when you build an open source program

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
office you must ensure that you have the

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
key participants

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
um in your i.t risk who are experts in

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
analyzing the vulnerabilities and

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,080
understanding open source products

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,800
you're using so that they can tell you

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
how much risk exposure you may have

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,319
especially it is

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,840
very important in a regulated company

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,199
like us

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,919
second the most and i would say

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,160
active participation in reviewing the

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,840
open source policy standard procedures

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,360
is key analyzing metrics escalating open

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,639
so securing license

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,400
issues is in different uh governance

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,720
forums will help um developers to stay

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
on top of remediating your

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,440
vulnerabilities

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,520
and this will help strike a balance

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,479
between enterprise risk and open source

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
risk

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,319
so from a business alignment perspective

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
legal counsel

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,879
is key organizationally with respect to

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,039
open source program office as well

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
so it is important to identify the right

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,720
legal counsel

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
and appropriately trained legal counsel

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
to participate in your compliance and

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,240
legal review activities

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,879
so your legal department is probably

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
very evers as most are

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,039
the risk aversion without technical and

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,120
open source compliance background can

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,800
help to stifling innovation

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,840
staffing of new ideas so the partnership

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
is important there

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
with the legal counsel believe it or not

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
our

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,919
legal counsel have github accounts

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,680
review code in github review licenses

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,960
based on which the development team may

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,599
think it should be

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
able to identify ip leaks which in legal

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,039
terms call

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
intellectual property so talo will help

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
us

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
uh kind of talk through the partnership

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,599
uh

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,479
with the brand that we have sure thanks

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,080
maureen

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,159
so as maureen mentioned we're really

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
thankful to have built these connections

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
with risk and legal

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,360
and the same goes for brand as well and

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
specifically when it comes to our

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
partnership with brand we're thinking

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
about

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
things we're doing outside of capital

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,920
one ie contributions

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
and our sponsored projects and in a

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,959
nutshell

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
what brand helps us to do is those

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
things that we're

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,480
not typically good at as a standard

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
staffed open source program office so

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
they help us with search engine

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
optimization so when folks are

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,600
searching for open source they're seeing

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,680
what capital one is doing

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
they help us with our creative so this

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
is a great example all things open

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,839
where we go to market our our products

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,399
and tell our story

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,560
and and really anything when it comes to

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,560
storytelling and content marketing and

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
writing blogging it's awesome to have

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,040
the hand on

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
for them to have a hand on that output

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
and i'll hand it back to noreen so we

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,399
launched the capital one

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,080
open source program office in 2015

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,399
one year after the first open source

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
contributions the open source program

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,800
office

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,560
was really established to govern how the

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
engineering community uses

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
open source software and engages with

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
the open source community

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
so at a high level ospo has three main

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
very tactical functions carried out

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,600
in partnership with risk legal and brand

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,320
partners

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,920
so number one ingestion so able to

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,839
manage cyber security

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
and license risk while development

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,680
community is taking the advantage of

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
open source components

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,920
to build in in-house applications

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,040
is key contribution able to

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
manage intellectual property legal and

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,320
cyber security

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
risk while engineering teams contribute

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,160
back to fixed bugs

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
on the library that is being used

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,200
internally as part of the propriety code

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,399
and number three

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
sponsorship govern the launch

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
and maintenance of capital one open

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,079
source projects while creating

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,240
and launching open source project for

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,640
external use so it is very

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
important to understand where ospo

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
should land

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,800
in order to be effective and efficient

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
to carry out the functions

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
so there are several areas where you

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
could and instantiate

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,320
an open source program office and a few

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,959
things that can factor in

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
um and they are number one depends on

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,720
how centric your business is open source

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
software to land within the line of

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
business

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
or open source program office could also

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
land within

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
a horizontal tech organization so that

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,920
they

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
it can act as a liaison between the

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,120
engineering teams across the lines of

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,720
business

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,040
risk legal and brand application design

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
groups however are typically going to be

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,839
the

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
uh the org that has the most skin in the

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,760
game and are the strongest stakeholders

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
for ensuring that

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,959
you've got the open source orientation

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,959
established accurately

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,640
so in addition to the open source

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,839
program

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
office tactical goals right there is

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
also

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
primary and strategic and responsibility

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,079
and

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,839
and one is the fostering open source

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,800
like culture within your

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,120
organization and anytime you talk about

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,079
open source culture it always bubbles up

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
to the surface

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,959
right so embracing open source

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
methodologies that the rest of the world

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
uses

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
and bringing them inside your

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
organization's corporate firewall and

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,959
company's culture is important so

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
in other words it's called inner

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,760
sourcing so in a source is a term

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
coined by tim o'reilly to describe the

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
use

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,800
or adoption of the open source paradigm

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
inside an organization

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,079
so it is very important step on the

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,440
journey to become mature

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,079
and responsible consumer or provider of

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
an open source at an enterprise level to

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,079
instill

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
a mindset with your software developers

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,839
that they are free to use open source

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,839
software and free to take advantage of

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
the liberties the open source provides

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
them

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,760
as long as they do so within the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
oversight and compliance policies of the

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,639
organization

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
whether they might be um whether this

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
might be

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,959
uh where they need that whatever the

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,959
policy they might be

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
using right because one policy does not

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,440
fit all

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,519
so things to keep in mind right um so

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
number one standardization of the tools

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,880
and engineering

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,959
practices is important owning and

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
overseeing so ospo is the center of the

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
universe for seeing

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,000
open source strategies and methodologies

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,720
for determining

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
how you can execute on that strategy and

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
align

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
across the organization to achieve that

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
strategy

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
so number three communicate and

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,040
communicate

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,279
be the open source evangelist able to

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
talk to everyone at every level

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,959
from intern to the executives on what

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
open sources and why you're using it

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
and how you're using it what are the

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,519
advantages is

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,120
also very important have a shared

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,360
backlog of features for

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
in-house development to promote reusing

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,000
and innovations rather than starting

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,160
from

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
scratch with every development project

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
teams can

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,880
modify existing code developed elsewhere

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,440
within the organization which helps

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
teams to reuse application code

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
reducing code substantially so rcicd

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
pipeline development is one such

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,360
example which is built on the basis of

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
inner sourcing in partnership

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,880
with lines of business uh last but not

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
the least

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,120
recognition reward for inner sourcing

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
and reusing versus reinventing the

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
wheels

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
um the picture on the right will head

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,600
home

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
when you see the two ways of developing

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
products

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
one is more of a mandated and one-way

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,000
approach versus

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
building in partnership and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
collaboration and sharing the same

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
backlog

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
with your lines of business so as you

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,720
embrace the inner sourcing culture

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,199
maintaining open source license

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,839
compliance reviews and oversight

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,279
which is another key and tactical goal

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,079
if you go to my next slide tyler

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,000
so as a consumer of open source projects

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,959
what are we going to do to ensure we are

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,959
compliant

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,959
with the open source licensing we are

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,800
taking advantage of and to make sure

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,839
that the open source components

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160
that we're using don't have security

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,600
vulnerabilities

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,279
that we need to be aware of or what we

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,880
can discover security

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,040
vulnerabilities later on if they surface

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
um after we begin using an open source

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,079
component so so many questions right

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,399
so number one we need is a continual

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,480
compliance result a process to

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
manage the use of open source as part of

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
the business process

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
inside the enterprise that provides

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,839
clear decision pathways on

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
criticality of the findings the use of

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,279
open source supported versions and

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,920
remediation timelines

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,160
number two identify a scanning tool that

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,560
fits with your ci cd pipeline and

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
business needs to proactively scan the

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,360
code

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
and maintain a long-term database of

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,040
those scan results

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
so that you can identify which license

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,560
are in the code and

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
also the vulnerabilities number three

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
analyze track

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,199
and report out security vulnerabilities

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
and license violations

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
to enforce best practices throughout

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,519
your development life cycle

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
number four clearly define automated

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
controls

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
and embed them in the process so that

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
you can

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,839
enforce remediation prior to releasing

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,240
the code

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,639
and number five continuous monitoring

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,000
and audit is important to stay in

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,040
compliance and use

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,839
open source responsibility so um

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,000
a quick kind of uh picture on the right

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,079
that shows the uh

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
very high level devops pipeline but as

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,680
you build your devops pipeline

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,240
remember to have the top five

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,480
characteristics automate policy rules to

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,079
enforce shift left scanning for early

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,720
notification

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
frequent release enables speed to market

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,399
and any

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,800
early feedback low smaller batch size to

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,720
prevent vulnerabilities and transparency

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,839
is key to gaining alignment so

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
what are the um what are the risks of

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,800
using

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,560
open source software right so before we

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,639
talk through the various risk of using

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,480
open source software did you know

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,320
like open source was coming into your

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
environment through a number of

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,240
different avenues for example

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
approved components usage developer

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
downloads

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,839
code reuse commercial apps outsource

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,640
development etc

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,439
so basically all applications contain

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
open source

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,919
and more than likely your applications

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
are containing more open source than

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,400
your proprietary code

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,000
so open source is free right so

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,319
no initial monetary cost uh free as

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
as in freedom you can use distribute

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,120
modify the source code

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,600
without asking the author permission so

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,679
it is

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,840
very important to understand the risk

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,240
and those obligations to ensure you

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,000
are prepared that the right people are

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
involved right tech is used

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,799
and right process is being put in place

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,799
so also like unlike

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,320
commercial applications that push those

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,039
updates for you

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
your developers are actually responsible

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,640
to pulling those

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
updates to keep it keep your code

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
complying

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,320
open source code complying so developers

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,919
are the first line of defense

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,840
um they're the ones bringing in the

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
software and they're the ones managing

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,679
it so there needs to be

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
a you build it you own it mentality

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,840
embedded in your culture

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,000
and what is and it's also consistent

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,559
with overall devops mindset too

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,840
right so since the vulnerabilities can

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,000
be found anytime

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,080
and so as the breaches continue to

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,440
increase the continuous detection

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,960
remediation becomes absolutely necessary

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,120
remediation in the security world

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,000
is to repair or upgrade to the most

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,559
recent

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,039
supported version that does not have the

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,200
vulnerabilities

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,799
so there are also real legal risks and

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,919
also to keep in mind that

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,000
you need a license if you are using open

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,400
source software so that is your

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,080
legal permission and you're required to

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,960
adhere to the rules

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
um authors of the software have over

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,799
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
different licenses to choose from when

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,039
you think of the licenses then think

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
about it

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,440
in two general buckets we have right

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,240
permissive and copy left when it comes

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
to permissive

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
generally the obligations that you want

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
to give attribution to

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
the author right you want to give them

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,760
the credit

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,600
the other end of the spectrum you have

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,880
is a copy left licenses in certain

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
situations

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,400
um you not only have to distribute the

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,000
source code and show the source code of

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
the copyleft license

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
that you're using but you also have to

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,559
share the source code that it touches

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
so this is a very specific use case

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,000
analysis and

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,679
you need to be mindful of your business

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
needs as you intend

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,120
using open source and the license that's

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
associated with it

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,960
so also you're using the open source

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,679
software that you are bringing in as

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,799
is meaning you have no recalls against

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
the author from

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
what you got it so this can be a tricky

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
area

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
to explain to the engineering teams um

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
so for

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
a commercial software you have those

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,679
warranties um

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,400
and they are covered for you however um

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,280
not for open source so legal counsel is

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
um

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,679
and why legal counsel advice is really

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,840
important because legal terms can get

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,360
very complicated and this is where a

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,640
close partnership

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,720
helps so remediation for license can

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,760
slightly differ from security license

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
remediation

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
for license remediation you can replace

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
it with an alternative

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
open source library or something you

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,760
write yourself or

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,960
use a commercial alternative

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,360
however for remediations uh for

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
that are that could also be conditional

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,919
meaning if

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,559
i use the open source uh this way your

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,280
action potentially could be a different

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
thing

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,840
so since it is a conditional you can

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,559
work with your legal counsel to get

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
approval to use a certain license uh

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,000
based on the business

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
condition and maybe you may get approved

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,159
to use that

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
based on your business need or the way

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,080
you use it

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,600
so community health risk and transitive

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,120
dependency rules i'm

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,880
going to touch on both together because

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,000
they're sort of interrelated

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,640
it is important to ask yourself of

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
a couple things right as you use open

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,720
source software you know what

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
is the age of that project what is the

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,000
is the community strong in terms of

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,760
supporting that project

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,679
when was the last commit made to this

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,640
open source project so

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,559
um in order to prevent vulnerabilities

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
it's important that you check the

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,960
community health of the project that

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
you want to bring into your company or

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
you want to use as part of your

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
application

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
so automated scanning tools help to

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,240
identify vulnerabilities

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,840
and license issues in which scenarios um

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,880
in such scenarios so

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,880
remediation is basically for

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,480
both of the of these scenarios could be

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
like remove and replace with another

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,039
open source and

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,960
if it's really important to your

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,400
business needs then contribute back and

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,039
support the project

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
which is a good segue into my next slide

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,919
on

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,760
contribution so let me tell you why it

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
is important to contribute back to open

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
source first

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,679
in order to improve your your risk

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,400
posture for example fixing bugs

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,000
closing cves upstream to libraries that

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,200
are widely used within your

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,080
organization it's very important so

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,480
to reduce the risk of being vulnerable

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,679
and

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,679
avoiding breaches as you are

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
taking advantage of open source it is

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,919
expected that we give back

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,080
as well to the community in the form of

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,880
code improvements and enhancements

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,240
and launch new projects that we will

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,520
touch on a bit

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,000
uh tala will go over that in much detail

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,799
so your path to contribution cannot be a

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
bumpy road

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
i like to use this analogy all the time

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,760
you can see on the left hand of the

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,559
uh slides there's a picture as you drive

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
your car

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,640
on the highway if you get toll gates

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,159
wherein you have to manually pay for it

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
every five minutes wouldn't you get

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
frustrated right

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,320
so but if you have an easy pass you will

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,240
not mind the toll kids because you can

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,159
go through without stopping some

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
without stopping right similarly it is

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,520
important that

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
you have the right processes in place

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,280
automated to prevent your organization

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,760
from security and license issues

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,080
intellectual property and data links to

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,799
support contributions upstream

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,080
so you'll be surprised how much you

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,960
could save cost

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,200
by contributing upstream so do it in

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
john mark walker's talk tomorrow at 12

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,799
30 p.m

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
fostering on open environment for

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
developers in a regulated

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,799
industry but he will go through the

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,760
supply chain and talk in depth about why

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,120
contributing

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,320
upstream is important so a bit of a

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,679
sneak peek

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,960
we have built a tool it is a a cli

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,000
command line interpreter

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,480
and github's provider that shifts left

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
the production and code pipeline quality

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,080
gates

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,600
to run before code is committed or

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,400
transmitted to server

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,120
so the following checks are automated as

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
part of this

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,320
process that is sensitive data scanning

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
pre-approved open source license and

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
project checks

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,480
commit verifications and contribution

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,320
analysis is performed to

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
protect our developers from data

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,799
exploration

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,640
license violations and brand reputations

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,679
risk so

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,679
we are in the pilot phase and

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
making to open source this product at

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,559
some point um

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,799
so with that i turn it over to tyler

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,799
bell to talk through the process of

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,799
launching our open source projects

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,279
thanks maureen um and thank everybody so

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,799
i want to just talk a little bit about

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,799
um you know the thought process that

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,640
goes into launching an open source

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,520
project both from the developer's point

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
of view

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,640
and from an open source program office

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
point of view

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
so here we have steve ballmer here who's

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,520
got this great idea

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,440
maybe a project he's been working on at

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,640
home or maybe there's a project inside

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,840
of capital one that we're using

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,440
internally

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,440
either way he realizes there's some

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,360
applicability outside of capital one

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,480
and wants to publicize this project as

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,840
soon as possible

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
with the goal of having widespread

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
adoption and impact

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,360
uh which will ultimately result in

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,200
contribution back to the project

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,440
um and then a widespread sustainable

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
reach so he wants to make sure that

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,880
the project is marketed in the right

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
channels and that the right people are

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,760
seeing it

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
so that he gets the proper involvement

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,679
into the project

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,559
um so naturally you know as a developer

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
typically does

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,640
right they want to look on you know how

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,039
to go from a to b as fast as possible

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,120
um as noreen talked you know earlier on

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,600
about who our partners are

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,240
and how legal and risk and maybe even

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,559
brand

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,799
um have been groups that can be a

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,799
showstopper for your releases

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,880
um so it's natural to understand why a

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,320
developer may not want to

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
you know reach out to those folks or

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
engage with them prior to making their

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,440
project public

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,960
um and not doing so can actually result

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
in a riskier project launch

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,480
and a higher risk of a failed project

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,520
you know however you want to define that

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,960
so instead of going straight from a to b

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
we want to talk about a few things that

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,159
you need to consider risk-wise

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,919
before you make your project public

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
so there's basically three buckets of

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,559
risk here and it's a deeper dive

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,240
of the community risks that noreen

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
shared earlier in addition to some brand

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
risks so the first one is risk to

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,080
capital one brand

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,000
and the first specific risk here that we

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,760
want to avoid is producing or consuming

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,679
any poor quality code

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,440
so the last thing we want to do is

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,640
create a project and put it out there

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
and tell people to use it

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,640
and then folks realize that it's full of

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,200
vulnerabilities and findings and

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,520
just poor quality clunky code that's one

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
risk we want to avoid

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
the other one is obvious accidental

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320
sharing of npi again something

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,919
non-public information something you

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
never want to do

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,360
um and then we want to avoid the risk of

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,480
a lack of participation

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,440
in oss communities so we talked about

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,840
some of the work we're doing with

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,760
contribution why we see it as important

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,880
but in general nobody wants to be that

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,279
person who

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,960
is hugely dependent upon open source

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,480
software to build their products

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
and aren't giving anything back to the

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
community so we don't want to be viewing

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
that

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,159
that light from a brand perspective we

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,240
want to make sure that it's known that

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,080
we are giving back

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,679
we want to avoid a low project ceiling

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
so avoiding things like inadequate

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,279
marketing depending upon

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,279
the size and intent of your project we

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,559
want to avoid insufficient support and

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,440
insufficient road maps for these

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,880
projects as well so we want

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
people in the open source community to

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
understand what the intent of the

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
project is

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,720
um to see the road map and understand if

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,360
it's something they want to get involved

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
in

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,120
you know give them that option early on

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
you know you don't want to set up a

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,640
project you know where it's kind of gray

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,320
as far as what the future is

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
right we want to avoid community

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
stagnancy as well

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,039
so avoiding a buildup of unresolved prs

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,480
and issues

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,799
if you're maintaining an open source

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,000
project i know it can get busy but

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,080
nobody wants to

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,039
work on that project that has 100 open

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,919
issues

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,120
and 100 prs open that are two years old

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,919
you're going to lose contributors that

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,760
way because

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,360
people will get frustrated they don't

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,159
want to go through all that effort of

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,640
refactoring

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
all their code and their contributions

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,279
you know that didn't get reviewed for

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,640
two years

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,200
so that's a no no you want to try and

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,360
avoid we also want to make sure that the

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
community is driving the project itself

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,039
so it's fine to have maintainers from

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,679
your company but you also want to have

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
folks who

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
have real say and sway um into

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,080
the main the maintenance of the project

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,679
and the future of the roadmap

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,080
and we also want to make sure that there

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,640
is a proper retirement strategy

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
not every project needs to be the

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,840
project that lives forever and keeps

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
building on new features it's okay if it

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,760
solves a temporary problem

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,520
so long as folks know know that in the

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,279
beginning that this is not our intent to

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,399
continue to develop this for years on

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,760
end

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,440
as we would a more premium project

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,720
so another question you need to ask

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,279
yourself is what's the intent of the

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
project

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,399
and we see a lot of projects come

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,919
through and we see you know some of them

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,279
are software projects others are data

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
models that come through

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,000
that folks want to share with the world

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,000
um and so we tend to bucket them into

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,039
three sizes of experimental standard and

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,720
premium

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,399
experimental could be one where a

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,600
developer is

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,279
working on something at home the

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
basement and just wants to put it in

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,600
github

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
to see if it garners any interest or

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,559
maybe it's a data scientist that just

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
wants to share a model with a small

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,080
community

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
um that's okay so long as they pass

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,679
legal checks and security checks

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,520
the things like branding and roadmap we

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,440
can kind of set that aside

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,559
the next level up is a standard project

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
and this is where we would at least

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
require something like a six month road

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
map

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,799
and a couple of project champions who

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,640
have dedicated time as part of their job

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,840
to maintaining and supporting these

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
projects

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,880
the next one would be our premium tier

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,320
project and these are

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,880
the projects that we expect to have

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,440
hundreds to thousands of users

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
and immediate immediate impact to the

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,520
community

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
once the project is launched um and

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,840
these

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,679
these require a little bit more tlc and

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,399
a little bit more level of effort here

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
because we want to make sure that

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,720
projects that have this much work

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,679
put into them are getting the right the

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
right view

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,200
or excuse me or getting the right

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,200
visibility into their project so

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,159
this is where groups like brand and

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
marketing help us out

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,559
i want to go through an example

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,559
specifically we actually

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,559
just launched a new project um called

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,080
crit which is a command line interface

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
tool for bootstrapping kubernetes

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
clusters

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,640
and i just want to talk about the

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,760
engagement model between the

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
uh five four four or five teams here um

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
that went into the approval process to

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,240
launch this project and make sure it was

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,840
ready for launch

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,919
the first one being the development team

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,760
who is

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,960
responsible for managing the code their

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,559
repositories roadmap and documentation

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,320
in addition making sure they have

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,080
quality code resolving any security and

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,840
license findings

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,120
and then maintain the community again

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,799
prs issues github projects

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,399
they're responsible for maintaining the

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,519
community

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,519
um they engage osbo and or tech risk

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,960
who ensures that the proper scanning has

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,240
been performed

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,799
so that they can actually go ahead and

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,559
resolve those findings we outline

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,159
best practices for github and how to

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,840
manage their projects in github

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
and we facilitate the formal process

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
with our stakeholders to give a green

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,600
light to launch the project

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
so um we bring in risk brand and legal

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,960
so that they don't have to make that

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,559
touch point themselves

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
legal in this case actually went ahead

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,640
and worked one-on-one to help them

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
either remediate or disposition their

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,039
license findings

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,640
so in most of these cases

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,080
there were findings that were able to be

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
resolved rather quickly and then in

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,840
other cases

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,399
there might be use cases where we just

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,799
need to

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,679
accept a you know some low amount of

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
risk and

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,960
legal helps the dev team make the right

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,159
decision here for the project

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
they also make sure that we don't have

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,000
any trademark violations when we launch

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
a new project as far as the project

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,840
naming convention

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,559
and then any other industry or patent

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
risks

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,000
out there that you know a developer may

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,640
not be you know

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,960
or may not have top of mind um they're

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,480
there to cover off on that perspective

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,080
and lastly brand and brand is

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,679
particularly important

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,080
for our larger projects so they help

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,120
assess the need for content marketing

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,480
they do a ton of writing for us and they

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,600
are gearing up to do some content

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,159
writing on crit

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,080
as we speak um they helped us with our

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,679
internal and external communication so

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,039
also you know sharing in the news inside

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
the company

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
and then lastly they consult to develop

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
storytelling so

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,399
um with this one again they help us with

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,000
things like um

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,519
with like creative when we go to

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
conferences and events and

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,600
uh publish information and forums um

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,120
really anything that we're not prepared

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
to cover off on ourselves from a

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,440
marketing standpoint they jump in

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,279
and so this project was recently

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,960
launched and um we can uh

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,640
uh follow if there are any questions on

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,880
it so

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
um again going back to sweaty steve

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,360
ballmer here wanting to get his project

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,200
into github as soon as possible again

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,519
we're not we're not looking for

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,640
steve to go and make friends with lego

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,080
risk and brand

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,519
but we are looking for them to make

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,919
friends with the open source program

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,679
office so that we can introduce them

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,919
and facilitate the right conversations

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,440
because these stakeholders you know or

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,159
these partners that you may not know you

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,679
had

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,200
they're not they're not hurdles or

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,960
roadblocks right they're actually the

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,559
folks who want to remove barriers

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,559
that you may not realize you have or

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,480
that may come along down the road

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,559
um you know so bring them in early and

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,159
often make that commit

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,840
make that partnership with your open

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,519
source program office and we will help

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,120
cover off on any of the grounds that you

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
may not have thought of

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,519
and all of that if you follow these

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,399
steps you're more likely to have a

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,919
successful project in github

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
um and the proof is in the pudding here

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,360
um hygiena's been out for

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
five years now we're seeing it uh

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,240
continually grow as far as visitors

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,559
forks stars um you know we have projects

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,039
that our community is owning and driving

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,919
um and you know for for five years to

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,800
see

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,879
a project that was immediately popular

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,560
to still have an impact in the community

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,399
has really has really been awesome and

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,679
it's been without

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,679
not possible without the help of our

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,720
partners

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,200
in addition to those metrics we've also

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,040
formed a consortium in 2018

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,679
we realize there's a few frequent

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
contributors and core contributors

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
you know in a few different companies

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,599
and somebody asked the question can we

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,800
can we even form a consortium and this

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,399
is one where we brought in

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
uh legal and said hey can we share

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,040
information about what we're doing

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
across companies

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,560
lego helps us out and you know to help

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,839
understand what that blurred line is of

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,280
not sharing you know your company's

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,200
secret sauce or

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,399
um collaborating in good spirit of the

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,639
open source community

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,079
um so that's just another example where

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,240
legal is able to lean in and help

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,800
and then brand did the storytelling of

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,400
this cross-enterprise collaboration

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,400
and more companies have joined the

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,079
consortium as a result

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
so the point here is that good

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
communities are not formed on accident

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,720
they take a lot of effort and a lot of

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
effort from

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,839
a lot of different people whether that

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,280
be your dev team the product managers

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,880
marketers content writers lawyers

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,800
security advisors you name it

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,160
so at the end steve ballmer is happy

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,440
because his project is far more

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,880
successful than it would have been had

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,839
he just kind of launched this on his own

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,280
time

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,960
and capital one's happy too because

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,320
we're not exposing ourselves to any

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,839
unnecessary risks

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,839
i'll quickly touch on the software

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,160
foundations that we sponsor so

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,040
many of them under the linux foundation

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
um so

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,160
and we also support python software

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,880
foundation and are part of the

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,160
to do group and sponsor apache software

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,079
foundation

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,680
um and what i want to share is important

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,480
here is that um

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,520
at the very least you know aside from

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,400
just being a good steward in the

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,920
community

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,599
we're dependent upon the software that

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,640
these communities create so we'd be

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,800
crazy not to

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,720
want to engage them whether it be with

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,520
thought leadership and participation or

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,200
if it's

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
you know opening up the wallet you know

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,280
and investing in those communities

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,880
um specifically this year we've gotten

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,920
more involved in the continuous delivery

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
foundation

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
and i won't go through all these goals

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,520
here but i will say that we've had the

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,280
opportunity to lead the end user council

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,839
where we're facilitating sessions with

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,359
several companies um and user end user

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,800
council members and guests

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
um to talk about what are the projects

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
that they're facing in their delivery

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
pipeline

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,760
are we seeing similar problems you know

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,599
as devops matures as a whole and devos

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,119
matures at each company

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,400
and so this is very new but we're

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,760
excited about it and if there's any

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
interest please be sure to follow up

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,400
after this talk

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,760
and then this year we're also really

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
excited we got to announce a couple

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,000
months back that cloud custodian was

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,480
successfully donated to the cncf

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,560
um so frankly custodian outgrew capital

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,920
one and uh we wanted to make sure that

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
its next home

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,839
had the proper guard rails governance

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,760
and reach to make this project

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,119
continually successful

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,880
so we did a lot of work this year to get

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,640
this project ready for launch

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,119
um and i'm proud to have them owning

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,119
this now

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,960
with that i'll pass it back to noreen to

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
kind of sum up

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,440
key takeaways from today

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,320
thank you tyler um so the key takeaways

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,560
right

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,160
ensure that you have identified the

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,960
right key metrics

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,119
um have a process to analyze track and

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,520
report out compliance metrics

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,640
so that you could have a faster

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,040
compliance process

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,640
fewer license violations and avoid

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,880
security vulnerabilities

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,119
so track your contribution health is

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,760
very important whether you are going

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,800
to be a more of a consumer or a

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
distributor

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,119
right track track the health of your

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,160
scan results with the commit prs and so

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,520
forth

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,200
know your partners who they are in the

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,720
company that will help you

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,000
get to the strategic goals and

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,560
a successful open source program offers

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,480
collaborate collaborate and collaborate

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,200
identify

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,000
again i could not stress enough like

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,839
identify

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,079
the partners that can help you um

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,520
you know establish a successful open

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,920
source program office

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,960
so tyler anything else that i've missed

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
out you want to add

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,240
no i think that's a great summary i'll

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,839
just say folks you know you've heard us

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,440
say you know legal risk brand

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,720
um you know over and over again and it

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
might be more than these groups you know

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,920
we also have

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,119
internal audit that helps us test our

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,720
controls and

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,960
the point i want to make here is that if

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,400
if you're not sure or i want you to try

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,839
and put a face to the name of each of

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,440
these groups you know think about who

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,200
specifically in your company is someone

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,200
you can reach out to

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,400
and engage with and then as maureen

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,000
mentioned metrics are going to be so

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,200
important to prove the point about why

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,119
open source is

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,119
important and why they should care and

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,200
if you can if you can prove that

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,119
they will be wildly helpful for you down

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
the road

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,480

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,520
