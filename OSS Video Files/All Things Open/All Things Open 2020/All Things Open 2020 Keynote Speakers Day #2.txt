Talk #1 - Angie Jones, Applitools
10 Commandments of Navigating Code Reviews
For those who are underrepresented in tech, navigating code reviews can be hard. For example, a study of Github code reviews shows that people are much more critical of code when they know it’s submitted by a woman. Software Architect, Angie Jones, will share the 10 guidelines she follows for navigating code reviews, which have worked for every codebase she has contributed to. These practical tips will help lead to a productive process that will help you get your code accepted faster, and without the drama.

Talk #2 - Marten Mickos, HackerOne 
Security is Everyone’s Responsibility
The future of work is changing. As the work-from-home model becomes the norm and work becomes more broadly distributed, more applications, systems, and infrastructures are more vulnerable than ever.

At the same time, cybersecurity is a $100 billion market that’s wasting resources and frustrating customers with inadequate protection. We need security designed into products, not applied on top of them. We need ubiquitous security, not just on the perimeter. We need openness and collaboration. And we need to make security the responsibility of everyone, not just the CISO and their team. If we don’t learn from the breaches of the past, they will continue to increase in size and frequency, slowing down society, harming companies, and consumers. In this talk, Marten Mickos presents a vision for a world where everyone is diligent about cybersecurity and thereby the total cost of it goes down, not up.

Talk #3 - Sarah Drasner, Netlify
An Animated Guide to Vue 3 Reactivity and Internals
There is a lot of talk about Reactivity in the frontend landscape of late, but what is it? And how does Vue use reactive premises to manage state in an application? In this talk, we’ll go over what reactivity is in general, and how that applies to the upcoming changes in Vue 3. We’ll cover proxies, the virtual DOM, and watchers along the way.

Talk #4 - Chris DiBona, Google 
Open Source Licenses at the Center
Open source is now a mainstream component of software development and culture. With this growth and normalization of open source, the license is often taken for granted, and we forget its role in shaping the project and community well beyond just using the code. Chris will talk about these overlooked dynamics, and remind us why it’s important to keep open-source licenses at the center.

going to go ahead and get started

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,480
i'm going to do this for about 10

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
minutes or so give people a chance to

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,120
sort of file in the room

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,440
uh and and virtually be seated

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,200
and get ready for keynotes the actual

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
programming that will start at 9am

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
so i do want to thank everybody for

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
being here this is day two

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
day two of a conference is always an

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,719
interesting one right uh

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
the ones that i've been to um uh you

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
know

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
maybe people are a little tired they

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
were out late the

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,719
you know the previous evening uh dinner

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
and then whatever they chose to do

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
uh maybe not the case here i don't think

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,080
i don't know if anyone was out late last

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,200
night so we're not seeing tired eyes or

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,080
tired bodies

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,600
walk into the conference center uh but i

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
really hope you enjoyed day one

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
we had a lot of people on the site tons

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
of people joined us from all over the

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
world

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
and it was really a great day one

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
programming was excellent keynote

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,280
speakers were great all the speakers

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
really did a great job

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
so again it's great to have you back for

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,640
day two i'm guessing a number of you

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
were with us on day one

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
and then a good number of you i'm sure

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,320
are here for the first time

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
and you know this is your first day so

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
again if you were not with us yesterday

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,159
welcome

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
again just going to run through a couple

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,840
things uh some of them

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,439
repeat from yesterday so if you're with

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
us for the intros yesterday you're going

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
to hear some of the same information

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
but we do want to get started on the

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,720
same really

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
in the you know really from the same

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,720
place so this is our eighth year

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
year eight of doing all things open we

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,399
started this in 2013.

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
i had been in the open source space for

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
a good number of years before starting

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
the conference

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
i knew it was growing i knew that people

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
were using open source on their own and

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,040
in some cases

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
back 12 15 years ago in the workplace

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,239
much less so than they are today

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
but again we've been very fortunate

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
and we've seen the conference grow year

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,560
over year tremendously

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
and this year we have had thousands and

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
thousands and thousands and thousands of

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
people registered from all over the

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,319
world

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,640
so over the two days we're featuring 200

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520
speakers more than 200 sessions

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,879
uh and again things have gone extremely

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
extremely well so we hope you enjoyed

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
day two programming today

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
uh why do we do this just a really quick

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,599
recap of why we do it

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
um you know open source is really where

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
all the innovation is coming from

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,640
in the tech world that's at least our

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
assessment maybe not every single bit of

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
it but

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,800
most of it is coming out of the open

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
source space it's because of

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
collaboration it's because of uh you

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,319
know crowdsourcing

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
right the wisdom of the crowds and

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,760
leveraging uh the wisdom of people

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
around the world and you're seeing

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
better technology results so everyone is

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
benefiting from

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,120
higher participation rates more people

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
contributing we're big believers in that

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,319
and we want to enable

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
that via the the conference that we use

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
all things open as a vehicle

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
to really catalyze or to facilitate that

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
process so

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
that's one reason why we do this we

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
think a conference is a great way to do

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,200
it

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
it's also a gateway to opportunity you

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,159
know you hear us if you've ever attended

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
our live events or

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,840
attended an event with us before you

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,480
know that we truly believe it is

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,319
a gateway to opportunity you can just be

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,319
getting into technology you can begin to

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,840
contribute to an open source project

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,280
you don't have to write code you could

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,879
be a technical writer you could be a

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
project manager a designer

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
you could be in marketing and you can

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
make great contributions and you can be

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,440
recognized for that that can lead to

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,360
jobs and career opportunities

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
friendships personal relationships that

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760
manifest in a variety of ways

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,120
so again getting involved in enabling

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
people showing people how to get

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
involved

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
is extremely important to us so again

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,720
it's really a gateway to tremendous

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,400
opportunity

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
also again the participation and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
contribution element of this

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,439
you know i think before people really

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040
begin to contribute and feel comfortable

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
and really know how to contribute

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
understanding best practices and how to

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
go about

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
you know really engage in the

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
methodologies and the processes is super

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
important

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
so we try to use our conferences either

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,040
the all things open platform or the open

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
source 101 series

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,799
as a way to do that as well so showing

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
people how to do that and on ramping

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,600
them into open source extremely

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
important in our opinion

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
and we use our events as a way to do

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
that for sure so

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,600
again that's that's a little bit about

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
why we do this in a little bit of

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
context for you

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
a little bit of history we did this

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
conference for the first time in 2013.

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,600
we had about 700 people that showed up

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,240
it was a great time

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
speaker lineup was amazing we really had

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,919
a good time

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,440
2014 that number increased to about 1100

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,360
and then we increased

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,600
uh pretty dramatically every year after

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,919
that 1700 2400

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,199
3200 4100 up to 5000 last year we're

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
here live in raleigh

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,160
of course i'm in an empty convention

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
center i'm live from the raleigh

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,479
convention center you can see the

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
seating behind me

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
we're in exactly the same ballroom you

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
know we're trying to do exactly the same

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
thing as we would if this were live

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
um but again so it's not quite the same

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
we'd much prefer to be here live with

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
you

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
i'd much be preferred i would much

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,320
prefer to be turned the other way

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,039
as opposed to speaking this way i'd much

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
you know

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
much prefer to be turning that way and

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
facing

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
full seat seats that were populated by

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,360
you not quite where we are

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,280
again 5 000 people in 2019 many many

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
more than that in 2020

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
we're virtual but this is going to be a

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
great event so we have seen some

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
tremendous growth

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
why have we seen growth i think because

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
of our community

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,160
many of you making comments over in the

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
chat feature have been with us for a

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
long time and by

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,800
been with us just friends just honestly

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
we view

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
our community the people in our

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
community as as friends we've developed

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,440
friendships and business relationships

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,080
and business partnerships and all kinds

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
of things

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
but at the end of the day you're part of

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
the all things open community we really

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
do value you

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
i don't want to sound overly clich

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
cliche-ish

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,800
or anything like that i don't want to

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
sound hokey but we really do value you

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
being part of this community

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
you know we joke all the time if you

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,360
were here i'd be giving you fist bumps

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
and elbow bumps and i'd probably put my

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
arm

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
around you a little bit and i might even

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
give you a hug an appropriate hug

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
of course uh but you know we do that a

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
lot here our team we look forward to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,280
this every year

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,039
and again it's just part of the

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,600
community right so

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
we truly enjoy you we miss you frankly

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
and we'd love to see in person but

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
hopefully we will next year

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
so it's really because of our community

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
that's what's enabled us to grow we're

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
very thankful for that and we're very

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
appreciative

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
of you being a part of it um also um i

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,600
do want to thank our sponsors as well

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,520
uh you know i would ask that you uh

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
really go out into the virtual exhibit

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,319
hall and and

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
patreon you know kind of visit our

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,759
sponsors and say hello

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,520
uh our sponsors are making all of this

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,560
possible without them it really would

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
not be possible

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
um i've been to an event i've been to

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,199
events before where they didn't really

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
recognize sponsors or maybe they were a

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,319
little hesitant to do it

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,919
didn't want to you know make it overly

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
corporate or things like that

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,520
we've always taken the opposite approach

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
uh you know if someone's supporting us

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
by extension they're supporting our

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,199
community so they're supporting in the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,800
open source community and we want our

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
attendees and our community to be aware

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,680
of it they need to know

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,120
who's willing to sort of you know put

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
their money where their mouth is you

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,479
know in order to provide that support

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,160
so we've never been shy about it and

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
today is no different i do want to thank

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
them

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
profusely and i want to encourage you to

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,800
go out to the exhibit hall yesterday our

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,520
exhibit hall was extremely busy

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
lots and lots of visits and badge scans

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,400
and chats and communication going on the

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
numbers were

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
tremendous yesterday i have no doubt

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,759
that the same will be the case today

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
so i encourage you to do that and just

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,039
let them know thank them and let them

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,599
know how much you appreciate them making

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,919
this

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
this conference possible our speakers

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,319
and our sponsors make all of this

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
possible without them

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,720
we would not be able to do it a few uh

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
oh also our presenting level sponsors

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
have made the free tickets available for

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
the first time ever we've done free

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
tickets we're you know

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,800
normally we charge a little bit we keep

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
you know we charge a nominal fee

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
normally for attending we have always

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
kept the price super low

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,080
very very low as a way to lower the

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,919
hurdle lower the barrier to entry

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,039
and really make it as easy as possible

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
we've always extended a lot of

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
scholarships in the past to make it

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
possible for anyone that really wanted

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
to attend to do so

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,520
but this year we've lowered that barrier

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
all the way and our presenting sponsors

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
have made that possible so

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
i do want to really pay special

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,080
attention to them and kind of

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
you know call them out for special

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,520
attention because that support has

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,879
enabled us so if you're here and you

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
registered for free

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
it's because of those four presenting

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,680
sponsors all of our sponsors are

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
important they've done a great job

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,440
but those four have enabled the free

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,279
ticket opportunity for you

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
um we do have a code of conduct we're

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
very proud of it

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
we're adamant about it we have been from

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,760
the very beginning we've been hosting

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
events for

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
10 to 15 years now a lot of you have

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
attended our events for more than a

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,160
decade it's hard to believe

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
i used to be the youngest person in the

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
room now i'm one of the older people in

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
the room

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
so that will all you young folks out

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,760
there listening and watching

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,080
that will happen to you too i assure you

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
and it'll happen quicker than you expect

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
but certainly happened to me but we've

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
been doing codes of conduct it's always

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
been extremely important to us

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
so it will be enforced uh again we are

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
adamant about it so

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
just be respectful to one another life's

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
hard especially this year what a strange

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
year

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
and life's difficult enough right we

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,839
don't need to add layers of complexity

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,200
on top of what's already difficult

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,279
by creating odd uncomfortable situations

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
and and things like that again life is

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
already hard enough so

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,080
just be very respectful that's always a

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
good guideline a good guide post

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
to sort of follow just you know treat

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,519
people the way you want to be treated

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
and we certainly encourage that our

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
leader board

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,480
i want to show you a slide very very

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,519
quickly i do want to share my screen i

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
want to show you the leaderboard from

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
yesterday leaderboard is

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
something we're doing for the very first

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
time we're giving away great prizes

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
as you're in the virtual platform

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
toggling around and engaging in activity

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,720
you're accumulating points we've never

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
done this before we've never been

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
virtual before

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
so we've never been able to do it but

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,920
this year we're doing it it's turned out

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
really well we didn't know how it would

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
go

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
we didn't want to again do anything too

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
gimmicky or anything like that so we

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
didn't want to diminish

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,279
the event or or the content but we also

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
wanted to make it fun

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,240
you know we wanted to turn it i don't

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
know we wanted to gamified a little bit

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
we didn't know how it would go

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
but it's turned out really really well

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
so let me show you something i'm going

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,760
to share my screen

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,519
and i'm going to show you a slide really

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,519
really quickly and here's what it is the

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
winners from yesterday

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
so the points that were accumulated

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
yesterday were

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
tremendous so a lot of people were very

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,760
active on the site i want to direct your

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
attention over the left side of that

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,040
slide

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
bottom left those were our top five uh

you know point accumulators uh for lack

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,680
of a better way of describing it from

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,079
yesterday so vishal was number one

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920

over on the right are some of the prizes

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,440
that we're giving away so system 76

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
is making a lemur pro available and then

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
we really tried to choose

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
items that we ourselves would want that

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
we really placed a lot of value and that

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
we would utilize

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,360
and that by extension we thought you

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
would get a lot of value of us out of as

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
well so we didn't want to get you know

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
make

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
you know just a t-shirt available or

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,160
something like that we wanted to really

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,640

you basically have your pick of all

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,120
those items that you see um system 76

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,959
made free uh computer um you know

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
the free laptop available to us we've

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,480

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
away one to yesterday's winner vishal

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,360
maybe you

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
and then one to today's winner so we're

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,240
actually breaking the prize distribution

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,480
up between days so

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
all of our winners yesterday we actually

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
start over today so if you're attending

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
you begin to accumulate points beginning

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,519
a few minutes ago once

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
once the site became live and once you

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
could begin to sort of toggle around and

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
once programming actually started

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,680
that's when you begin to accumulate

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
points so these were our winners from

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200

everybody starts over starts fresh today

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
but these prizes are real so what we're

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,800
going to do is contact our winners

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
and we're going to be in touch with them

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
and then we're going to ship these items

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
out

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
and again we're actually covering

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
shipping uh and

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
and you will receive these items very

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
very soon so again we just wanted to

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
make it fun for you but the

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,920
leaderboard's been a tremendous success

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,160
help desk if you're on the site today

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
we're we're sourcing the help desk

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
uh and then six connects our virtual

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,000
partner platform they have a technical

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
representative

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
there as well so your question is either

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,480
going to be more service oriented

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
something we can help you with

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
or it's going to be technical oriented

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,360
and in that case you'll be

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,880
elevated to a six connects person so

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
they're there as well so go to the help

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,240
desk you'll see help desk clearly marked

some superstars

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,399
uh and then that just continues all day

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
more than a hundred

you can follow up with them in the in

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,440
the chat within each session of course

but follow up with them as well a lot of

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,399
them will drop an email address in the

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
chat stream in their session

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,600
a lot of them will post their twitter

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,279
handle or maybe social media follow up

with them after the event

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,279
that's always a good thing most speakers

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,760
that i'm aware of are entirely open to

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
that

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
and they really enjoy engaging with

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
people both in their session and after

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,440
the event

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
participation certificates something

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,959

and we'll respond very very quickly um

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
two things i'll end on before we get to

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
angie jones

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,120
and i'm really excited about angie

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,480
speaking because uh

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
i don't know she's just really really

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,199
good and i'll go into that in just a

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
minute of course you already know that

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,040
that's why you're here

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,160
but i still i think she's an amazing

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
superstar

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,440
um so two things i do ask for your

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
patience as you're on

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,680
uh the site today um i don't wanna sound

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,079
i don't know i hope this doesn't

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
come across as odd or strange this has

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,199
been a strange

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
year i mean this has been an odd year

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
for everybody

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
i i don't know what else to say it

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
certainly has been for us

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,480
so by transitioning virtual i'm just

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
going to be honest i'm going to put it

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,399
out there

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,720
we're having to learn new things

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
ourselves a lot of us even on our team

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
we've never done we've done one

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
virtual event before this but it was a

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
much smaller one so never anything at

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
this scale

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,160
if you'd just be patient with us you're

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,279
going to see things wrong you're going

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
to see things go wrong

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,560
on the site i can tell you that i'm not

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
going to blue sky you

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
i'm too old to blue sky you frankly i've

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
lived

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
too much life to know that things don't

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
happen they do and they will today

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
so just you know i ask for your patience

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,240
and your flexibility and just

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
uh bring it to our attention we'll

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
address it quickly i promise

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,360
and then you know we'll try to get you

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
and and we'll try to rectify the

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
situation

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
but just know that we really are trying

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
our best as is everybody that's on the

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
site today

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,760
the world is just a different place now

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
i don't i don't know what else to say

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
and everybody's adjusting and things

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
like that final thing thank you

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,680
i really appreciate you being with us

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,160
you could be at a ton of other virtual

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
events

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,519
so many other virtual events are going

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,839
on they're all great uh

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
but you've decided to be with us and and

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,839
again those numbers will increase and

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
you know

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
a lot of people are going to join us

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
throughout the day we don't take it for

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,759
granted

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,560
um it's again you're an amazing

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,000
community

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
you could be lots of other places but

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,920
you chosen to be with us so thank you

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
very very much we truly truly appreciate

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,759
that

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
with all that said let's go to our

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
keynotes this is why you're here so

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,199
let's kick this off

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
um angie i see you're with us that's

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,800
great

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,560
so here's what we'll do angie jones is

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,240
with apple tools

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,759
and you probably know her from test

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,680
automation university

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,199
and a few other things as well again

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
when i said superstar it's an

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,360
understatement

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,759
it really doesn't do angie justice um we

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
are

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
when we're not virtual we're based in

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
the research triangle park in north

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,399
carolina this is an amazing place

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,639
angie i think you have a tied to the

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,399
research triangle park the rtp

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
so it's kind of home base i believe for

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
you maybe initially

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
if i'm not mistaken i hope i'm not off

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
by that but anyway it's great to have

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
you with

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
us you do an amazing job we're looking

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,480
forward to your talk and

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,880
here's what we're going to do i'm going

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
to mute my microphone and my camera

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,040
and i'm going to go away and i'm going

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,839
to yield the virtual stage to you

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
okay so if you want to um make sure your

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,800
microphone there you go

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,800

or two before have you yeah

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,399
i i know you have so i'm gonna go away

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920

and yield it to you but angie thank you

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
for being here

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,680
thank you so much todd good morning

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
everyone

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
or good evening depending on where you

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
are

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,880
so i have a question for you have you

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
ever

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,440
gone on this roller coaster ride

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
where you pour your heart and soul into

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,120
your cold

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
you feel really proud of yourself once

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,360
you're done

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,480
you submitted for code review

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,760
only to be met with comments that are

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,640
harsh blunt and sometimes downright rude

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,120
yep so many of us can relate to this

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,520
deflating experience right

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,919
the fact of the matter is that

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,960
co-reviews are a form of feedback

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,120
but they often lack that thoughtfulness

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
that would be exercised if critiquing

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,919
someone on say

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,880
anything else and trying to make

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,080
every code reviewer be polite and

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,840
thoughtful

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,200
it's just a feat i simply don't have

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,720
the energy to take on and i realized

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,400
long ago that i can't change people's

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,360
actions but i do have control

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,799
over my reactions so i've taken a

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
different approach

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,559
and it's worked marvelously on every

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
team i've

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,120
been on

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,120
okay sorry i get to my slides right

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,559
so with this approach that's what i'm

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,000
going to present to you

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:26,000
it's my 10 commandments of navigating

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,840
code reveals first one

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,640
thou shall not take it personally

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,400
so you can get nasty review comments for

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,440
various reasons and

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,400
let's be honest and state the obvious

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
some people are just jerks right but

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
some people they may lack the

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
social skills to be able to give

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,000
feedback in a constructive way

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,679
some people they thrive on power and

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
you know they get off on having that

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,480
authority to say

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,679
ship or no ship some people they pride

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,600
themselves on

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,440
being brutally honest and they don't

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,720
want to go that extra mile

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,520
to soften messages and

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,280
some people have biases that color the

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,200
way that they see you a study of github

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,200
code reviews show that

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,679
people are way more critical when they

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,799
know it's submitted by a woman

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
and trust me as a black female

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,760
programmer

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,080
i've certainly gotten my fair share of

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,760
rude and patronizing comments when

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,799
joining a new team whether it be

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,720
corporate or open source

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,200
but wondering if i'm getting this

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,320
comment because i'm a woman

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,799
or because i'm black or because some

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,000
combination of both

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,280
is only going to stress me out and i

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
imagine other

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,200
underrepresented demographics may have

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
these same thoughts and i know a lot of

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,000
junior developers who do as well

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,120
but here's the thing dwelling on

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,320
why you're getting rude code review

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,919
messages

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,080
and my opinion is a waste of time

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,159
and energy and you'll only become

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,320
further frustrated

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
now don't get me wrong this sort of

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,200
treatment is in

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,280
no way cool or acceptable but i also

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,880
don't think fighting each of these

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,039
reviewers head on

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
will result in the change that we want

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,200
to see

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,120
so to save my own sanity

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,080
i give every reviewer the benefit of the

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,840
doubt

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
and assume that their comment is

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,799
directed to the code

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,799
and not me

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,480
now one way to avoid taking things

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,000
personally

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,240
is to not become married to the code

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,320
take that ring off okay now i know how

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,120
much of ourselves we invest into the

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,240
code that we

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,120
write and that passion is great

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,679
but if you truly want to commit the best

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,000
solution possible

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,000
you have to be willing to accept that

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
maybe the best solution

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,280
is not the initial one you submitted

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
let's look at an example

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,440
here's an exchange in a given code

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,919
review

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,760
so it says this is complex for no good

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,000
reason you don't have to show off

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,919
less is more and the submitter replies

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
this is not me showing off it's a

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,960
complex problem and thus warren's a

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,480
complex solution

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,320
well it says you can accomplish this

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,799
same thing with a single while loop

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,080
and they say my solution works just as

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,960
well you know

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,440
i really worked hard on this sad face

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
emoji

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,320
now let's take a step back here when

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,880
someone looks at this

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,080
you the submitter are the one who looks

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
emotional

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,480
and defensive the rudeness of the

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
reviewers comments

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
is overshadowed by the submitter's

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,280
attachment

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,120
to that original solution now once

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,960
you've learned to detach yourself it

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,760
becomes a lot easier

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
to actually hear what the reviewers are

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,440
trying to say

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,120
right so you will avoid going through

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,240
the torture in your head

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,000
of why are they being mean to me

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,320
is it because i'm filling the blank

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
and i can't tell you how much stress

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,600
this helps avoid

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,600
because now you can read past the

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
bluntness of the comment

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,039
and you can see the points that they're

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,559
trying to make

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,520
and now you're free to truly consider it

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,120
is what they're suggesting actually a

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,240
better solution

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,240
if it is thank them and make the change

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,280
so when the reviewer says that you can

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,679
accomplish the same thing with a single

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
loop

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,360
the submitter says good point that would

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,760
be cleaner

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
and remove some of the complexity let me

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,679
work this thank you

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,679
now doesn't that sound so much better

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,440
now having said that let me acknowledge

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
that

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,720
more times than not you probably do

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,320
have the most optimal solution to the

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,320
problem you're solving

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,919
right so when someone suggests that you

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,080
should change your code

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,440
don't automatically assume that the

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,120
person is right

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
you worked on this for hours maybe days

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,720
and the reviewer is just kind of

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,159
throwing ideas out there after they're

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,200
seeing it for only

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,039
a couple of minutes so consider the

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
reviewer's suggestion if you haven't

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,840
already

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,320
but if yours is better articulate why

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,279
and do it right there in the code review

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
because you want

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,080
all the other reviewers to also know how

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
thorough you are

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,400
so the convo could go something like you

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,679
could accomplish the same thing with a

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,960
single while loop

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,640
and you reply yeah you know i initially

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
thought the same thing

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,480
but i have to also iterate through this

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,640
list

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,520
that led me to this solution which

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,880
handles all cases

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,960
look at that now let me tell you i've

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,480
seen the rudest people

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,760
change their tone after i make such a

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,320
statement

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,679
and i've now earned their respect and

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
i've proven

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,960
that i'm just as smart as they are

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,520
because i originally had that same idea

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,360
and you know what i might even be a

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,600
little bit smarter because i've

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,080
considered something that they haven't

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
so this is a sure way to get people to

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,679
ease off

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,400
in future reviews because they now trust

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,000
that you know what you're doing

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,760
now let's say that you've considered

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
their recommendation

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,880
and you know that's not the best

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,640
solution but

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,919
they don't think that your solution is

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,360
the best either

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,320
what do you do well you don't get into a

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,120
heated back and forth exchange you know

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,559
after a few messages if you can't come

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
to an agreement

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
it's time to step away from the code

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,880
review and offer to collaborate offline

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,880
on the solution

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,880
so the exchange could go something like

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
you know well there has to be a simpler

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
approach to this

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,240
and then you say something like you know

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,559
i'm all for the simplest approach

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
possible let me find some time on your

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,159
calendar

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,360
so that we can whiteboard it out you

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
didn't crumble

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,760
you know and just take their solution

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,279
you also didn't get emotional

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,840
because you are not married to this code

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,799
and people will appreciate and respect

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,840
both of these qualities

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,760
number six thou shalt contribute to

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,919
others co-reviews

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,000
now if you're always the submitter and

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,039
never the reviewer you're going to be

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,080
perceived

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,880
as more junior than you probably are and

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
think about it

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
the people who are most respected on the

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
projects

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,039
are who the ones who are frequently

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,200
reviewing other people's code

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,720
and it doesn't matter if the submitter

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,640
is more senior than you

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,039
are even better right think about how

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,919
powerful you become when you're able to

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,640
help them see

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
something that they didn't before or you

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,120
introduced them to

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,640
some new technique this is instant dev

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,520
cred

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,400
it also allows you to see other coding

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,760
styles and

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,159
techniques which in turn can make you

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,679
a stronger programmer and more

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
knowledgeable about the

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
code base that you're contributing to

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
number seven thou shall treat submitters

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
how thou

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,559
wants to be treated now when you're

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,159
reviewing code remember

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,520
not to take on the same attitudes that

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
you despise

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
just because someone is brutal and

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
leaving

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
comments for you doesn't mean you have

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,120
to stoop to that level

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,080
and i know that this sounds obvious

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,120
but listen i've witnessed levels of

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,480
pettiness

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,039
that adults simply should not possess

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,240
if someone just ripped you apart in the

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,880
cold review

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,640
yeah it's tempting to return a favor

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
when you see one of their pull requests

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,960
come through but don't do it

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,440
be the bigger person and stay true to

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,919
who you

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
are comment on that review the same way

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,520
you would like

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,039
others to comment on yours and who knows

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,799
maybe your charm

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,440
and professionalism will rub off on them

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,279
number eight thou shalt not be

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,919
intimidated by the number of comments

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,679
i know that it's super easy to feel like

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,919
a total amateur when

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
you have a review with tons of comments

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,640
right and things get even worse when

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,000
there's

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,320
multiple people making multiple comments

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
and

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,960
i'm not gonna lie to you uh this doesn't

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,360
look great

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,399
but don't count yourself out remember

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,520
it's code

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,399
don't take it personally right so

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,279
if you're new to the project or it's a

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,480
new language or a new framework or a new

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,399
library

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
simply chalk it up to a learning

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,640
opportunity

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,520
go through each of the comments review

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,600
them

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,720
defend the solutions that you believe

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,120
are right

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
except the ones that are better but the

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,640
key here

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,279
is to communicate so i had to do a

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
project

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,240
in swift once and i'd never used that

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,080
language before

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,720
and my first few submissions were

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,880
riddled with code review comments

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
even from people who were junior to me

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,120
and that stings

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
right but i was new to the company as

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,960
well so

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,559
i hadn't yet established a reputation

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
with this team

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,640
and it became crucial to me that i

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,399
didn't become labeled as

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,760
this emotional woman who doesn't know

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,360
what she's doing right

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,720
so i had to explain my rationale but

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,279
in a non-defensive way so the review

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,919
went something like this

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,080
the reviewer asked why didn't you just

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,799
make the functions argument optional and

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,360
set it to a default value

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,679
and i say oh wow that's pretty cool we

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,080
don't have that option in java which is

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,919
the language that you know i rock

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,360
so uh you know i said i'll make this

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,679
change and read a bit

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,600
more about it as well so this shows

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,559
you're grateful for their help

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,159
you're not dumb you know you just are

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,640
used to another language

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,720
and more importantly you are willing to

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,919
learn

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,039
number nine thou shall not repeat the

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,120
same mistakes

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,480
this is a big one pay attention all

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,279
right because

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
nothing annoys reviewers more than

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,000
having to tell

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,799
a person the same thing over and over

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
again and i've seen cold reviews become

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,440
nastier and nastier when this happens

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,480
now when you accept someone's

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,080
recommendation and you make the change

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,320
take a moment and internalize why

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,000
you accepted the recommendation because

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,159
there's a lesson in there

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,320
and this goes back to making sure you're

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,240
not blindly accepting recommendations

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,799
just to get people off your back

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,480
and get your pull requests accepted if

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,520
you're doing this

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,159
you may not be processing the why and

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,640
the why

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,600
is the lesson and once you understand

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
why

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,200
you're not likely to make that same

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,080
mistake in the future

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,960
so if the reviewers are not explaining

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,840
why

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,960
they are giving you this recommendation

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,000
ask them

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,279
you know and when you're reviewing other

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,760
people's code

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,720
always provide rationale with your

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,039
recommendation

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,279
that helps it stick better okay now

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,080
whenever viewer tells you something once

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,039
and you immediately start incorporating

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,679
it into

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,039
your future submissions people realize

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,200
you're sharp

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,080
and they only have to tell you something

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
one time and you

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,159
get it they have no choice but to

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,960
respect that

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,159
and the final commandment is to embrace

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,600
the knits

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,679
so there are people who seem like major

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
knit pickers if you don't know any it's

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,600
probably

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,919
you right um and their only comments to

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,120
you

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,519
are about misspellings and other trivial

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,840
things that the linter didn't catch

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,360
if you've gotten to this point

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,919
congratulations you've actually managed

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,399
to write

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,000
code that your team has no problem with

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,799
fundamentally

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,360
remember don't take it personally don't

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,039
roll your

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,600
eyes and say such and such always has to

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,039
say

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,480
something such and such probably

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,519
respects your work

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,559
and just has an eagle eye fix the stupid

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
typo

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,159
keep it moving all right so there you

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,840
have it folks

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,840
these are the ten commandments

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,399
and it's the gospel according to angie i

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,399
keep them with me

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,720
on every team that i work with and

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,760
they've not failed me yet they've helped

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,760
me to go

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,760
from newbie contributor to

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,880
well-respected contributor

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,000
in a matter of a couple of weeks so i

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:29,840
hope that they work

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,840
just as well for you happy coding

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,080
all right uh angie thank you very much

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,519
so here's what we'll do

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,279
um you can stop sharing your screen yeah

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,000
there you go stop sharing your screen

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,840
there and i will

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
thank you very much you did a great job

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,000
by the way thank you

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,240
oh my god well i have heard you speak

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,399
before so i sort of knew

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,320
i sort of knew what to expect uh and i

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,519
think a lot of people in our audience

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,799
did know what to expect uh and you

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,159
gosh you didn't disappoint i was

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,279
watching the comments come in as you

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,640
were speaking

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,399
omg that's so true so true oh my god

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,519
that's so true i've been there i've had

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,440
that happen

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,720
comment after comment after comment

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
after comment so

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
i think you're right on the money and i

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,320
think your talk's really really going to

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,519
help a lot of people

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,440
um so to our attendees um if you want to

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,480
pose a question directly to angie or

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,760
communicate with her

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,039
here's what we've done angie if you

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
would maybe stay around just for a

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,880
couple minutes and i'll ask people to

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,880
pose their questions or comments to you

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,559
utilizing the q a feature

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,840
so if you're an attendee at the bottom

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,840
of your screen because we're doing a

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,600
zoom webinar you see three options three

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,480
ways to communicate with people

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,120
one is q a one is chat and one is raise

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
your hand

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,000
because we're in a keynote block we're

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
not gonna do raise your hand so we're

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
not gonna enable anyone's audio or

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,080
anything like that but you can utilize

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,519
one and two

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,640
q a and chat if you put a a comment or a

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,120
question in chat

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,159
because there are so many going up right

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,519
now being posted

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,360
they're going to sort of trickle down

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
and really they're going to probably be

00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
lost in the shuffle

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,000
because again just a lot of

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,159
communication chatter so if you'd focus

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
your comments and your questions to q a

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,200
and i'll ask angie and i'll ask our

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,320
speakers that once you complete you know

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,159
once you finish your talk

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
you can maybe focus your attention on q

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,720
a and be looking for the questions that

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,359
come in

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,800
you know within that channel and the

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,159
ones that are directed to you if you

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,320
don't mind responding that would be

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,079
great but i really really do appreciate

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,119
that

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,240
thank you have a great day okay so with

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,159
all that said we're going to go to our

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,440
second speaker now

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,200
um martin is uh martin mikos is our

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,240
second speaker you know security angie

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,079
touched on

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,440
code reviews an incredibly important

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,520
topic

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,520
and you know what we try to do with our

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,639
keynote block is really focus on high

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,480
level topics

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,240
that are widely applicable that impact a

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,320
lot of people and we try to feature

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,000
speakers and talks and abstracts that

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,760
really hit on those in a way

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,359
that can deliver a lot of education a

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
lot of value within a very short period

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
of time

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,280
that's our goal that's kind of our

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,040
guiding you know principles

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
that really lead us to what we you know

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,880
what we try to uh

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,720
you know secure as keynote topics and

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,839
keynote speakers and things like that so

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,000
again these are right on the money

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,119
security is incredibly important there's

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,720
probably not a more uh probably not a

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,440
better expert on planet earth than

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,359
martin

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,200
on the topic of security he's ceo of

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,960
hacker one if you haven't heard of

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,400
hacker one you need to you need to go do

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,920
some research right now

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,599
and learn more about it because it's a

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
great organization they host events

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,560
around the country and around the world

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,000
i would encourage you to check one of

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,200
those out as well and maybe martin will

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,960
touch on that just a minute

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,160
so martin let's see you're coming to us

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,839
from the west coast i think you're

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
coming to us from san francisco

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,200
so i really appreciate you getting up

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,880
early it's very early out there

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,200
maybe you're an early riser maybe you're

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,800
not if you're not i thank you even more

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
how about i add a multiplier on that

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,320
thank you

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,680
and thank you twice for being with us so

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,200
anyway with that i'll turn it over to

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
you to talk about security

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,320
and i think the title is security is

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,880
everyone's responsibility

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
so with that i'm gonna mute my mic and

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,000
mute my camera

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,359
and i'll yield the virtual platform to

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
you martin but thank you very much for

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,160
being with us

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,560
thank you thanks for the very warm

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,800
welcome here to all things open

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,520
my name is martin mikus i'm the ceo of

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,720
hakka1 and i'm here to talk about

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,960
software and security because today

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,800
we used to be able to develop software

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
without ever thinking of security

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,720
information security or cyber security

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
but today there's no software you can

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,599
develop without having to think about

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,440
how to make it

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,280
trustworthy how to make the software

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
secure so that's what i'm talking about

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,839
today

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,880
and let me share my screen here

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,880
i have to find my slides there we go

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,839
share and

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,839
present

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,119
so as i said there's no coding anymore

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,359
that doesn't

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,880
involve an aspect of security whatever

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,760
we're building for ourselves or for

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,240
somebody else

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,839
for public use or not we must make sure

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,960
it's as secure as possible

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,480
to reduce the risk of cyber breaches

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,480
disruptions

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,480
any kind of cyber crime that may happen

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,680
and i'm martin mikus i'm ceo of hakka

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,400
one i was previously

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,480
previously ceo of mysql and we learned

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,800
back then about open source that

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,000
in open source some people spend an

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,760
awful lot of time

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,520
in order to save money and they are

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
users and some spend

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,880
a lot of money in order to save time and

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,720
they become customers

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,800
so there was this division into two

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,839
different types of of users

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,680
in open source in security

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,200
it's a little bit different everybody

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,839
have to has to spend money

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,760
everybody has to spend time cyber

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,480
security or information security or just

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,520
security

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,079
will not work if we not everybody is

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,599
participating it's everybody's duty

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,920
everybody is spending a little bit of

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,480
money and some time to make sure that we

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,880
reach the cyber hygiene that will keep

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,160
our systems safe and trustworthy

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,040
because when our systems are not

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,280
trustworthy we get all kinds of societal

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,440
side effects and bad problems in in

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,440
society that seem to not relate to

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,119
software but they do relate to software

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,599
when people can't trust the software

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,920
they are using

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,359
so what is then security some people

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,400
have been thinking that security is

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,680
about making sure

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,320
nothing bad ever happens but there is no

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,359
absolute level of security there's no

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,880
place where

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,040
cyber risk is zero it is in

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,440
the practice of information security is

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,280
probabilistic risk management

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,640
you think about the probability of

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,480
something bad happen

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,400
happening and you're trying to reduce

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,920
the likelihood of it

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,720
so you're looking for the most

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,160
economical way of reducing the odds of a

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,240
cyber breach

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,440
like how can you make the cost for a

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,680
criminal go

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,599
up as high as possible how can you make

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,839
the likelihood that your own employees

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,359
will make a mistake as low as possible

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,040
and every day you work on those

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,359
likelihoods there's those

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,400
percentages and try to drive them down

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,640
they will never reach

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,640
zero but if you think they can go to

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,960
zero you are already wrong

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,359
it's just an uh everlasting practice

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,000
of reducing the risk step by step by

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,520
step

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,040
and it starts from when you develop

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,880
software see when you

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,880
design software you have to design

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,880
security in from the start

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,560
and we used to never do that at my scale

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,359
we developed the fastest

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
most lovable database of the world we

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,920
didn't think much about security

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,400
we thought about thought about

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,160
performance robustness ease of use

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,680
and things like that but today

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,680
everything needs to be secure

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,280
so where we have csos leading the

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,440
security

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,119
work in a company what does the c really

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,920
stand for and of course we know it

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,119
stands for

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,760
chief but there are two schools that we

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,560
are seeing

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,640
there's the commanding information

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,839
security officer and the collaborative

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,160
one

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,680
and it's clear that in the past we had a

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,440
practice all over the world

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,760
of thinking that security was something

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,720
where you had one person in charge of a

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,640
small group

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,320
who had unlimited authority to block

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,480
anything stop anything

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,359
command anything and the others didn't

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,000
worry

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,480
but you cannot outsource security it has

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,440
to be

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,720
everybody's responsibility so let's look

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,520
more closely at it

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,280
in the in the old school the main

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,359
principle of cyber security was that

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,599
it's closed it's confidential it's

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,680
exclusive it's just a small group

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,920
of certified professionals who will even

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,079
know what cybersecurity is

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,000
but in the new world we are saying no

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,920
it's open it has to be open

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,040
it has to be inclusive so that everybody

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,280
can participate

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,240
and we have to be transparent about both

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,160
the problems

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,920
and the solutions we have to be

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,720
transparent with what went wrong and how

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,400
we fixed it and what we are learning

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,000
and when you look at this as an open

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,839
source developer you will say

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,359
hey but that's exactly how we do it in

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,319
the in open source software

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,599
and that is so true so what hacka1 is

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,680
doing in security

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,720
is what open source did to software

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,720
development

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,000
bringing in a model where you are open

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,920
you're transparent

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,760
you're inclusive you're collaborative

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
and you work together with people

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,359
you work together with people you

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,319
disagree with but you work together with

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
them

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,520
and the goal in this new model is the

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,319
reduction of cyber risk

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,000
but in the traditional model the goal

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,760
was

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
impenetrability people thought that you

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
can

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
build an absolute defense on your

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,079
perimeter

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,160
and they were trying to reach compliance

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
against certain standards and laws that

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,520
you have to be compliance with

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,520
sure you have to be compliance and sure

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,599
if you can protect your perimeter

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,680
nothing bad in that but that is not the

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,640
the real goal the real goal is to reduce

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,680
the risk

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,440
of any uh incident or breach or

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,839
disruption happening anywhere in your

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,680
digital asset

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,359
so in the old world it was only

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,400
certified experts who were

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,480
allowed and invited to do security

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,079
today it's everybody it's those who

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,839
design software those who develop

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
software those who test software those

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,200
who use software

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,119
it's everybody it's the leadership of a

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,200
group it's it's the ones

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,640
who are individual contributors may not

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,960
even work with software but they're all

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,880
using it and we're all adding to the

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,880
risk because we have something

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,560
that can cause a breach to happen we

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,200
have credentials we have access to

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,720
things

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
so we have to build the security

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,200
thinking into the practice of everybody

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,319
and that's a change from the la from

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,920
previous times when

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,319
we didn't have to worry about security

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,280
it wasn't an issue but it is an issue

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,079
now

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,440
and when we do it we will switch

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,119
security from being

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,160
a cynical guard of rules and and

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,000
and sort of a team that says no to a

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,280
business enabler that allows you to

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,960
build better software

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,040
that consumers will trust that they are

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,880
more eager to use

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,160
so instead of saying danger stay away

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,800
from this thing

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,079
we say tell us what you see let's learn

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,760
together

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
and instead of looking for blame when

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,359
things go wrong you do a retro and you

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,680
learn from it

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,040
and you're not blaming individual people

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,720
for what went wrong

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,160
this is a practice we've learned from

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,800
airline safety

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,560
where they will do retros and even tiny

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,359
tiny deviations in how

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,200
an airplane is operating or landing

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,680
anything all the details and they never

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,359
look

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,359
do it in order to blame people they do

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,280
it in order to learn and they share the

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,640
information between all airlines even

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,319
though they're competitors

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,960
we have to learn to do the same with

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,160
software and when we do that the cost

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,680
won't be unchecked

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,520
and go through the roof it will be

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,960
correlated with the results

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,119
that we are achieving so we must

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,160
democratize security make it an issue

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,160
for everybody

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,000
in essence we need to learn from open

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,160
source we need to do

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,400
to security what open source did to

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,680
software 20 years ago 15 years ago and

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,760
still is doing

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,440
we need to legislate cyber hygiene and

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,839
make sure that it's a requirement on

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,000
companies that are serving our citizens

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,040
we need to fix our software or throw it

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,880
away

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,400
we can't keep going with software that

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,520
isn't secure

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,680
and finally in education

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,359
we shouldn't call it computer science or

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,160
software engineering if there is no

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,079
cyber security courses involved in it

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,760
and imagine today you can take a cs

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,560
degree without learning anything about

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,560
security

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,800
that's so wrong it's so stupid it's so

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,480
bad and this is why most of the security

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,480
experts we have in the world today

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,000
ethical hackers security researcher all

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,680
these they are self-taught

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,920
because schools don't really teach

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,280
security today

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,480
so in the future when we do achieve

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,359
digital trust

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,920
it will be because we are we are not

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,839
ignoring hackers anymore we realize that

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
hackers are good people are trying to

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,480
help us

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,319
and if their bad people are trying to

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,960
break in they're not hackers

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,560
they're criminals so ignoring hackers

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,520
will be viewed as negligence in the

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,599
future

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,640
security will be collaborative we'll

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,200
work together

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,119
share our learnings pool our defenses

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,599
because that's the only way to work

00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,000
against an asymmetric threat

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,599
and we have to be transparent and open

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,480
because it's the only way

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,599
to build trust in any group it is the

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,920
only way to reach

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,599
a level of trust is to be open about

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,599
your shortcomings your long comings

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,319
whatever strengths weaknesses you have

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,319
openness leads the way just as open

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,599
source has been doing

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,640
so in summary there's just one way

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,079
to do security and it is together by

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,319
sharing what we are learning by

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,880
reviewing each other's code before it is

00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,960
in deployment after it is deployment by

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,400
doing retros of everything that goes on

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,079
so we can learn and

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,440
go back earlier in the software

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,319
development life cycle

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,839
to fix the problems we had there and try

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,400
to eradicate

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,280
the vulnerabilities and the bugs that we

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,079
are creating

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,880
we will still have weaknesses in our

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,280
systems

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,920
it is not possible for human beings to

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,800
build something that's completely

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,920
safe and secure for for cyber risk it's

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,079
completely impossible

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
if something has no weaknesses and no

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,680
vulnerabilities

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,280
then it wasn't created by human beings

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,680
so when it's human created

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,440
it will have weaknesses the good news is

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,599
other human beings will see it

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,240
they can come in and help and there are

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,240
today around a million ethical hackers

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,520
in the world have signed up at hackerone

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,280
will come in and review attack surfaces

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,920
try to break into websites mobile

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,240
applications apis whatever the

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,520
blockchain infrastructure whatever it is

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,000
to test it

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,520
and be the immune system of the internet

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
where they

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,520
try to break in and in that way allow

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,560
you to fix it

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
because the best way to avoid getting

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,560
hacked

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,400
is to try to get hacked because once

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,760
somebody tries to hack into you and you

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,640
they tell you what they find

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,000
you can fix it so by doing that together

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,040
we can create the same

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,960
positive effect within cyber security

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,319
that open source software created in

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,480
this world of software

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,319
and today you're stupid if you're not

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,400
using open source software

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,280
and soon you will be seen as negligent

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,359
if you're not listening to hackers

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,200
so thank you for listening today hope it

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,000
was informative i'll stay

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,160
around for the q a you have my contact

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,040
details on this slide

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,560
feel free to reach out tag me on twitter

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,240
and give me your feedback on what you

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,559
are learning how you are solving these

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,920
problems i would love to hear from you

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,400
thank you okay martin thank you very

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,800
much

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,839
uh thanks for being with us today i i

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,680
really can't thank you enough you've

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,839
been so influential

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,280
in the open source space for so long for

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,000
so many years and we've followed your

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,880
work for

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,559
again so long i i i mentioned that to

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,319
you before but it's absolutely the truth

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,240
i'd say the same thing to you

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,760
and and about you even if you weren't on

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,200
this call and if you weren't delivering

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,800
a keynote at ato

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,079
uh again it's very admirable the work

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
that you've done and continue to do it

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,400
hacker one

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,400
plus hacker one's just a really cool

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,720
organization i mean to have

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,319
a million people contributing and

00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,760
participating and things like that so

00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,040
i'd encourage anyone watching to get

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,640
involved in hacker one

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,920
the cause is great as you just heard

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,599
from martin and it's really a great

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,839
organization but thank you very much

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,520
again thanks for getting up early today

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,960
great great talk i can tell you've done

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,960
this a time or two you're very much

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,480
angie and all of our morning keynotes

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,720
have done this a time or

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,160
a thousand uh and they're very polished

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,359
and they really do a great job but

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,839
martin fantastic

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,400
okay so it's the audience doing it you

00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,480
know it's

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,160
we are just inspired by the audience

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,720
thank you thank you

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,480
you are very welcome okay so um now

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,319
we're going to move to sarah drazner

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,839
um sarah is someone else that we

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,359
followed her work for a while

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,440
what an impressive i don't know just

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,680
what an impressive person uh

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,520
she's um again vp of developer

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,079
experience at netlifly

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,359
um she's also a writer for css tricks

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,280
we're very familiar with css tricks here

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,400
chris was one of our keynote speakers

00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,200
last year i know chris

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
is you know uh really responsible for

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,319
that site one of the

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,160
one of the founders of that site uh

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,720
you're on the view core team uh sarah

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,160
which is

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,160
i think the topic of your talk this

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,200
morning and then what i'm most impressed

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,960
by

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,319
is you're a co-organizer for um

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,920
concatenate conf which is an african uh

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,680
based technology conference that

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,119
shedrick akintayo

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,520
who was one of our keynote speakers

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,160
yesterday referenced in his talk and i

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,440
think that focuses on kenya and nigeria

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,119
if memory serves

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,119
but he had talked about that conference

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,800
and i knew that you you know we're a

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,319
co-organizer and i knew we'd be having

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,839
you with us today so it's kind of cool

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,440
how those two things connect

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,960
but anyway out of the everything that

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,240
you've done it's not to diminish

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,760
anything that you've done everything's

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,400
impressive but i really respect that

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,240
about you

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,599
because that's just very very cool so

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,520
with all that said it's great to have

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,119
you you do a great job we follow you

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,119
everyone here follows you and we're

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,200
super excited when you agreed to speak

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,559
i wish it was in person again i'm here

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,400
at the convention center

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,760
and i wish i was again turned the other

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,200
way and i wish

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,440
sarah frankly you were turned the other

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,119
way speaking to a speaking to a packed

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,000
out audience but maybe we can do that in

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,599
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,440
but thank you for getting up early thank

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,880
you for joining us and with that said

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,040
i'll turn it over to you and i'm going

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,200
to turn my microphone and my camera off

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,680
and the stage is yours how about that

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,680
thank you so much todd can you hear me

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:17,040
can you hear me okay um let me

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,040
push play on this let me share my screen

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:27,200
okay can you see some votes yes yes

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:30,079
yes yep sure can you're great

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,680
all right i am so excited to be here um

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,680
thank you so much todd and all of the

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,680
organizers of all things open for having

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,000
me this is such a wonderful conference i

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,160
mean

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
i'm really passionate about open source

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,040
so i'm so glad to be here

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,400
um so why are they having me here today

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,240
uh well it might be because they're

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,319
curious about how view

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,079
three actually works and thankfully

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,000
that's a question i can answer because

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,480
otherwise that would be kind of awkward

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,960
um today we're going to go through

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,079
an animated guide of view three

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
reactivities

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,760
and internals um we're gonna go through

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,800
some really

00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,280
you know um deep down stuff but i'm

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,960
gonna

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,880
introduce it at a kind of high level

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,440
with some animation so that you can

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,359
understand

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,720
what's changing and what's staying the

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,880
same

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,319
as mentioned i'm sarah drasner or sarah

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,680
edo on twitter

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,599
i'm on the view core team um i'm a vp of

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,319
developer experience at netlify

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,559
as todd mentioned i also am a

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,040
co-organizer of concatenate along with

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,599
amazing people like codebeast on twitter

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,760
gift

00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,040
um a few other people that you might uh

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,000
be aware of

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,559
um i'm i mentioned that i'm a vp event

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
uh

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,839
of developer experience at nullify which

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
is neither netflix or

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,680
shopify which is very confusing for my

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,520
parents but if you're not familiar with

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,920
netlify it's my favorite way to

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,960
uh to deploy sites and apps which is why

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,800
i asked to work there

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,240
we also support a lot of open source

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,880
projects like react and kubernetes and

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,319
vue and lodash so if you're interested

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,440
in open source support

00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:03,119
that is also a good place to do so so

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,960
i'm going to walk through everything

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,720
today but i want to i want you to know

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,359
that all the demos for the talk

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,040
are also open source they're all written

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,319
in javascript even though they're

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,839
animated i'm going to be showing you

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,960
some animated things on the screen but

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,240
they're all still

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,960
just javascript um it's using a lot of

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,520
the same

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,160
premises that we'll be covering which

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,240
makes it

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,160
very meta i'm going to explain some

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,880
disparate concepts sort of in an

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,559
faq format based on real questions that

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,319
people ask me but one thing

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,400
to note is that the concepts that i'm

00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,400
going to show you are all interrelated

00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,520
so they work in concert together to

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,559
create a single experience

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,079
so what is reactivity the canonical

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,920
example that people usually show

00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,200
because it's a great one is an excel

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,480
spreadsheet so

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,200
if we were to you know have a cell that

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,920
was two

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,119
and three and the last one is five if

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,599
we're updating that and we have that sum

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,359
it's automatically gonna update in that

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,079
final cell right we have

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,040
we initially had a sum of five but we

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,520
didn't have to change

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,079
anything in order to make that six we

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,640
just

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,040
changed the first value and then that

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,640
you know updated as well

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,880
this is not the way that things work in

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,240
javascript so if i had a value of 2

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,559
and i had a sum and it was 5 if my value

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,839
of

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,520
2 i reassign to 3

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:30,559
and then log sum again it will stay 5.

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,200
so how do we adjust to changes

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,119
in javascript in terms of reactivity and

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,520
reactivity is something that is

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,880
a you know a kind of programming concept

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,000
that is bigger than just

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,559
view uh but it's really useful for

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,559
uis and applications because we do a lot

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,880
of adjusting to change

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,079
so in order to make those changes in

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,319
javascript

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,760
uh we would have to detect if there's a

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,680
change in one of those values

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,520
we'd have to track the function that

00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,319
changes it we'd have to trigger a

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,119
function

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,079
so that it can update that final value

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
so how does view

00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,760
3 do this view 3 just came out so

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,720
how does that do this we get this done

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,280
with a thing called

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,599
proxies so i made an animated explainer

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,640
that goes over it

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,640
we start with an object

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,839
we add a handler and a proxy to the

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,839
object

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,839
in this case it's the same

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,599
but look we can intercept the object

00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,280
with this proxy

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,640
and here's the cool part if we change

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,359
the first object

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,520
the proxied object updates accordingly

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,680
without adjusting the handler

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,079
with reactivity we can respond to

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,319
changes instantly

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,319
cool that was quick and kind of high

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,240
level so let's explore this concept in a

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,559
little bit more depth and then move on

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,760
so let's dive into what proxies are in

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,400
general

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,880
a proxy is an object that encases

00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,480
another

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,720
object or function and allows you to

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,040
intercept it

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,000
so he at its base here's what it looks

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,559
like new

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,760
proxy and you pass in the target and the

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,799
handler and let's look at what that

00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,599
looks like

00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:13,200
so if i have my dinner and the meal is

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,920
tacos

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,440
i can create a handler that basically

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,119
has this get method

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,119
that passes in the target in the prop

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,839
and we're returning the target prop

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,400
in square bracket notation if we get the

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,760
meal

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,880
and we say const proxy is the dinner and

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,280
the handler

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,559
and then we console.log proxy.meal what

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,119
do you think is going to happen

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,920
well you see tacos is returned that's

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,760
awesome because tacos are amazing

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,000
but what if we want to intercept this

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,880
value and we can actually do that quite

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,920
easily

00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,160
so we can console log something

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,760
like intercepted here or anything that

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,319
you'd wish

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,359
and we still return that you know our

00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,599
return

00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,359
our return prop and target prop and

00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,520
square bracket notation and cool

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,480
if what what do we see we see

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,359
intercepted

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,040
and then tacos so that gives us kind of

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,480
like a useful

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,680
um way to kind of be involved in that

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,480
object as we

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,640
proxy that object so you can see

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,119
console.log intercepted and there we've

00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:20,559
logged intercepted

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,520
so what if we want to do something

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,839
totally different

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,280
we don't we don't necessarily want to do

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,000
exactly the same thing

00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,480
we don't have to return the target and

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,559
prop

00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,079
we can actually do something completely

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,839
different so we can console.log

00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,480
we swapped out your dinner and i can

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:39,040
return burger and then if i say

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,400
you know proxy.meal and we say we

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,960
swapped out your burger your

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,079
your meal and that's a burger and now

00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,480
we're getting a burger

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,640
i mean that's that's crazy i don't want

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,000
a burger i want a taco so in javascript

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,280
that's called the trap

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,839
um it's because we can do and we can do

00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,400
many things

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,040
we can intercept things in many ways um

00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,760
and

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,000
yeah it's a trap uh we don't necessarily

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,720
want a burger instead of a taco

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,319
uh so the key here is that we can

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,200
intercept this in any way that we want

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,359
but if you

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,480
want to use it in the same way you have

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,200
to remember

00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,720
to also return that value okay so let's

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,359
go back to the initial

00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,040
uh example here so we're returning with

00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,240
that square bracket notation but there's

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,920
another way to extract the value

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,720
this is something that only proxies

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,720
allow us to do you can say

00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,480
reflex.get and spread the arguments

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,480
and one one of those arguments that you

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,480
can add is called receiver

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,839
what's important about receiver is that

00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,880
it allows us to bind

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:41,440
this properly that's important because

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,240
in view we do a lot of binding of this

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
we have to

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,559
bind this appropriately in order for

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,640
view to work under the hood

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,920
so this is really nice because we have

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,799
proper binding

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,599
so now let's talk about what we might

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,000
need here

00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,880
in order to make view reactive we

00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,640
mentioned

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,720
that we might need to track some of

00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,119
those values so we need a function

00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,160
that will track any changes that occur

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,240
with these objects

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,359
with these properties and values which

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,319
is called pre

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,160
called track in uh view three and it

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,799
saves any changes

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,200
those changes that it saves are then

00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,319
called

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,920
effects so

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,559
now in our set method we are going to

00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,040
show

00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,440
all of the same things the target key

00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,079
but we are also passing in the value

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
and we're returning that reflect of the

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,359
set

00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,960
of all of those arguments but there's

00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,079
one last thing that we can do oh and

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,559
this is called trigger

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,160
in view so we're triggering we're

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,119
running the changes

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,359
that have to be updated and there's one

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,359
thing that we want to do for efficiency

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,040
we want to store the old value in the

00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,880
new value because we want to check

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,400
if the old value is different from the

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,760
new value and then run

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,760
trigger because we don't necessarily

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,359
want to run trigger every single time we

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,319
only want to run it when something has

00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,160
changed

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,680
cool so now remember this list

00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,160
this list is the list of things that

00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,480
we'd have to do to update those values

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,680
automatically or with some reactive

00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,799
premises

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,200
um so okay looking at this detect when

00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,799
there's a change in one of the values we

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,839
no longer have to do this anymore

00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,240
because proxies is

00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:22,000
already doing this for us we're going to

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,520
track the function that changes it and

00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,640
this is literally called

00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,240
track in view we're going to trigger

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,720
the function so that it can update that

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,640
final value and finally

00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,480
the function that changes it is called

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,359
effect so if you need to find any of

00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,000
these methods

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,799
the code base is here now you know in

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,880
view two

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,920
everything was one single package in

00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,480
view three

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,280
we split it out into many many packages

00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,440
uh

00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,359
reactivity is now a package in and of

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,880
itself so you can use that separately

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,319
from all of the rest of you

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,160
and you might ask like why is that

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,880
necessary well let's say you were

00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,119
working with

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,960
non-dom operations right there's a lot

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,880
of stuff that vue does

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,559
in order to work with the virtual dom

01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,160
that you don't necessarily need if

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,480
you're working with electron or

01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,240
native development so that's a separate

01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,440
package so that you can code split and

01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,280
tree shake

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,760
and all of the packages are separate now

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,640
so you can have an extremely small

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,319
build if you'd like to check out any of

01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,240
the things that i mentioned before you

01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:22,640
can see them in this package

01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,839
in particular and if you wanted to look

01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,319
at them for just

01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,599
your life for any other curiosity

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,319
reasons that's where there

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,599
they are another thing is that proxies

01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:34,599
are now es6

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,440
previously it was es5 and below so

01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:40,640
object.define property was how we used

01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,760
uh view three so view our view two

01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,599
in view three we're using proxies

01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,359
we are making a separate package that's

01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,240
a little bit bigger to support older

01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,280
browsers

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,000
but this smaller build supports modern

01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,880
browsers

01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,599
and is really really performant and

01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,760
efficient

01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,079
so you can check out all of that work in

01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,440
the view next repo

01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,040
cool so let's dig into how watchers work

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,799
if you're familiar with vue you might

01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,520
know something about watchers watchers

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,520
are a way

01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,200
to hook into some of that reactivity and

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,880
adjust to changes

01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,440
so how do proxies relate to these final

01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,280
dom

01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,799
updates how do we hook into them with

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,720
watchers

01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,079
so if you're not familiar with watchers

01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,160
here's how they work

01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,680
anytime we change this property you can

01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,839
see that we're watching

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,319
the same data property as that counter

01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,319
so we've got the counter is zero

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,319
and then we're watching the counter and

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,119
we're logging the new value in the old

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,200
value

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,040
and if we increase it or decrease it you

01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,960
can see i'm watching that property

01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,920
anytime the property changes

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,599
i can console.log and i al i can also do

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,160
a ton of other things

01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,680
but it gives me access to the new and

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,599
old versions of the value

01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,599
anytime something changes so how does

01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,000
this work in view three

01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,039
before we dive into that concept there

01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,880
are a set

01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,400
of base concepts to understand get it

01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,880
set anyway

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
um in order to understand the in our

01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,079
workings we'll have to cover

01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,960
sets maps and weak maps a set

01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,680
is a series of only values similar to an

01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,440
array

01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,680
where a particular value can only be

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,599
inserted once so what does that mean

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,920
if you have something like my lunch

01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,119
items and you have this new set of taco

01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,680
burger taco

01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,440
and you console log my lunch items the

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,440
set is really only going to store

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,200
the taco and the burger it's going to

01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,559
throw out anything that's redundant so

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,599
it's going to throw out my other taco

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,280
which is really sad

01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:38,559
i can only get that once a map

01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,559
is sort of like an object it's got some

01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:42,720
main differences but you can think of it

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,400
similarly because a map is a series of

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,480
keys and values

01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,079
but it has some key differences and it

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,200
has actually a lot of differences but

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,200
we're going to cover the ones that are

01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,039
really pertinent for view three

01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,760
key value pairs remember their explicit

01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,359
ordering it performs better in scenarios

01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,480
involving frequent additions and

01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:02,079
removals like set you can only add key

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,720
value pairs once

01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,200
and it has some nice methods like size

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,400
has

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,480
set clear delete by the key

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,720
um this isn't all the things that are

01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,319
different different about maps than

01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,720
objects but we're covering the most

01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:20,240
crucial ones for our purposes

01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:23,039
so just like in set map

01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,480
in a new map in this example for new map

01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,200
we can't

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,559
keep the same key value pair twice right

01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,200
we saw that in set

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,039
where if i have new map dot set lunch

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,520
one is tacos lunch two

01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,559
is burgers but if i try to log another

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,640
lunch one

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,640
it will throw it away i get lunch one is

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:44,400
tacos lunch two is burgers and that's

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,760
it it doesn't add it again so the last

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,079
thing that we're going to talk about is

01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,000
we

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,440
weak map so it's similar to a map but

01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,599
the references are held

01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,680
weekly in other words if you delete

01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,039
something the reference can be garbage

01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,520
collected but in the map

01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,440
it can't so this also means that it

01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,440
loses the implicit ordering it also

01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,039
loses some of those nice methods like

01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,920
has delete by the key you know size

01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:10,079
and etc but the main difference about

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,720
weak map that's really crucial to view

01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,079
three

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,160
is garbage literally garbage

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,599
but more like a happy kind of garbage

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:20,160
because we like

01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:23,599
collecting garbage this makes view much

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,599
faster and i'll show you why

01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,960
so if we have something like this object

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,880
here

01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,799
when you pass an object to a view

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,359
instance as data view converts it to a

01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,359
proxy

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,119
this proxy enables view to perform

01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,720
dependency track

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,160
tracking and change notification when

01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,240
proc pro uh

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,000
properties are accessed there are two

01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,559
levels of dependencies for every

01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,559
component

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,839
the first level uses map and stores the

01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:56,720
dependency for every

01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:58,319
property the second level uses set to

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,119
track the effects that will be run when

01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,119
the values change

01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,599
after the first render we've tracked a

01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,319
list of dependencies in the property

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:10,319
accessed during the render

01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:14,480
conversely the component becomes a

01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,480
subscriber to each of these properties

01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,280
when a proxy intercepts a set operation

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,079
the property will notify all of the

01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,200
subscribers and the components we view

01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,680
reactivity

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,680
efficiently tracks all of the changes in

01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,760
that application

01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,359
cool so that was pretty high level if

01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,039
you'd like more information

01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:35,359
view mastery does a wonderful job of

01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,960
this uh they have a whole course on view

01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:40,160
through your reactivity that i

01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,760
uh suggest you try out okay on to the

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,680
next we talked about reactivity and

01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,920
watchers but how do those properties

01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,880
actually change in the dom how are these

01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,359
properties getting

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,280
reflected get it a little proxy joke in

01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:53,119
there in our interfaces

01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,720
okay so now let's cover how does the

01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,400
virtual dom actually work

01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,319
you might have heard this phrase before

01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,920
the virtual dom or the view dom

01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,359
it's a concept that many javascript

01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,720
frameworks use to create really

01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:06,240
performant api

01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,119
uh ui so let's dig in

01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,119
so here's the dom

01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,000
we make a copy in javascript called the

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,000
virtual dom

01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,000
we do this because touching the dom with

01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:21,839
javascript is computationally expensive

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,599
while performing updates in javascript

01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,440
is cheap

01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,799
finding the required dom nodes and

01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,839
updating them with javascript is

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,319
expensive

01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:33,280
so we batch calls and change the dom all

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,640
at once

01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,720
the virtual dom is a lightweight

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,160
javascript object created by this render

01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,480
function

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,599
it takes three arguments the element the

01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,039
object with data

01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,559
props attributes and an array

01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,480
and the array is where we pass in

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,680
children which all have these arguments

01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,720
too

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,839
here's the text in the div and it's

01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,880
child the uh

01:06:53,839 --> 01:07:00,799
the ul and now in turn the allies

01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,880
if we need to update the list items we

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:05,359
do so in javascript

01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,400
and only then do we update the actual

01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,079
dom

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,920
the virtual dom allows us to make

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:14,319
performant updates to our uis

01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,039
cool but what are the differences

01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:17,760
between

01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,599
the virtual dom and something like a

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,160
server-side rendered application with

01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,599
say

01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:26,000
next or gridson um let's cover that next

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,799
so what one of the questions that i get

01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,200
frequently

01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,480
is what is hydration and when we're

01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,280
working with some of these meta

01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,599
frameworks

01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,400
it is done in a slightly different way

01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,720
so but

01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,599
before we talk about hydration i want to

01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,559
first cover

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,200
why it's necessary so why something like

01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,880
jam stack with a client-side rendering

01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,400
solution the server delivers a file

01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,000
without content until you fetch

01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,839
everything in the browser compiles it

01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,280
and you're far away from that server the

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,640
latency for the request

01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,400
gets bigger with older server-side

01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,520
rendering solutions the server compiles

01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,440
and fetches everything

01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,799
builds the web page and delivers a fully

01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,400
populated html

01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,400
page that's much faster

01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,400
however every time you navigate to a new

01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,160
route the server has to do it all over

01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,880
again it has to compile and fetch it and

01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,720
deliver it

01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,760
this process delays the load sometimes

01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,760
by whole seconds

01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,560
recently an approach called jamstack has

01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,120
become popular which addresses both

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,560
issues

01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,560
we build the whole site and deploy the

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,319
content to cdns which means it's

01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,080
geo-replicated around the globe

01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,600
we never go back to a server on

01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,279
additional requests

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,120
we call it jam stack and not static

01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,359
because it extends beyond static

01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,359
we can make the page dynamic with api

01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:40,960
calls or server list functions

01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:43,199
and the user can use it right away

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,960
what's more because there's no server

01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:47,600
involved there are fewer attack

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:52,799
vectors that makes jam stack really

01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:55,679
performant and secure so

01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:58,000
when we're using jam stack premises and

01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,040
also things like next and grid sum that

01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
are pre-rendered

01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,839
not only are we having a single point of

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,279
uh not only are we not having a single

01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,799
point of origin server

01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,400
we don't have to make subsequent

01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,920
requests and it has

01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,920
better security because we don't have

01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,520
access to that single point of origin

01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:17,520
in the server so that in turn

01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,600
gives us amazing performance and better

01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,759
security so

01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,600
if it's statically rendered here's the

01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,440
part where i get that question about

01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,719
that hydration right

01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,560
if it's statically rendered and

01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,319
everything is just rendered on the page

01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,279
how do you actually interact with it and

01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:35,199
that's where hydration comes in

01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:38,960
it can speed up performance to initially

01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:40,640
serve raw html and css

01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,000
we can do this by server-side rendering

01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,000
an app and delivering it statically

01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,440
after it's been served vue needs to take

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,799
over some of the elements that are

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,000
dynamic

01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,000
this is called hydration

01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:56,719
so since the market markup has been

01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,239
rendered we don't throw it away and

01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,560
recreate recreate it

01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,080
instead we want to hydrate the dom just

01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,920
the pieces that are interactive

01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,920
and make those interactive here the

01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,560
button can now respond to changes

01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,760
and we can add to the cart and hydration

01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,080
allows us to create

01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,320
fast and secure sites and still have a

01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,560
reactive ui

01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,920
cool so with this these approaches we

01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,920
can pre-build and pre-render our

01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,600
applications while still serving dynamic

01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,800
content

01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:27,920
we learned a lot in what 20 minutes

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,440
we covered how reactivity works how view

01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,199
3 uses proxies how

01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,719
watchers work in view three how the

01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:35,120
virtual dom works in

01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,360
u3 and how and why next and gridson are

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,000
you using pre-rendered content and how

01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,560
they then

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,239
hydrate the dom that's fantastic we now

01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,880
know so much and our boundaries are

01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,880
endless

01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,400
so if you ever need to access these

01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,400
materials to review

01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,400
all of the materials are open source on

01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,560
my github at this url

01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,440
and all of the slides and the code pens

01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,960
so that you can

01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,040
explore all the code and all of the

01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,640
animations but they are also

01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,159
in the view docs i mentioned i'm on the

01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,880
view core team so all of this

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,679
explanation

01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,560
also lists lives in the new reactivity

01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,640
system

01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,880
are in the re reactivity section of our

01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,600
brand new documentation for the view 3

01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,400
docs

01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,400
so now can you not only build performant

01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,640
and beautiful experiences on the web

01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,480
you understand how all of these reactive

01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,840
premises and concepts are helping keep

01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,480
your users focus

01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,440
on task and enabling them to have

01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,800
superpowers

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,199
while they're enabling well while

01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,600
they're traversing your application

01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,600
thank you

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,560
sarah thank you what a great talk and

01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,239
you're right a lot within a very short

01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,640
period of time so you really did a great

01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,640
job

01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,840
packing that much in is not easy to do

01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,679
i've tried to do that

01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,400
in the past and i've not been able to

01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,239
pull it off nearly as well as you did so

01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,080
thank you very much a view in our world

01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,760
is incredibly popular right it's growing

01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,320
in popularity a lot of people are using

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,480
it

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,440
so that's one reason why you know we

01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,040
really wanted you to

01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,880
you know speak to the topic or you know

01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,400
talk about the topic this morning so

01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,640
and what better person to do that than

01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,520
you right so i hope all of our attendees

01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,520
enjoyed that

01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,880
uh and of course the recording of the

01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,719
talk will be made

01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,080
available we'll get editing that

01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,280
probably tomorrow we'll actually do that

01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,400
right away so we're trying to get that

01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,560
out as soon as possible

01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,120
but really great job thank you very very

01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,360
much for joining us

01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,719
all right well thank you okay so our

01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,000
final speaker in the block

01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,520
is one that um i've known of and sort of

01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
known for a little while

01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,600
chris de bono with google again we try

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,199
to touch on topics in the keynote block

01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,840
that are widely applicable

01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,679
very important and ones that once you

01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,360
know a little bit more about

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,960
that can you know that knowledge and

01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,840
that additional education can really

01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,560
help you

01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,480
open source licensing is really one of

01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,320
those topics it's often overlooked

01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,840
a lot of people i don't know how to say

01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,880
this really don't pay a lot of attention

01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,679
to it it's not

01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,560
sexy per se if i could use that word

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,560
it's just not

01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,960
you know in some cases it's not that

01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,719
cool but it is vital in our experience

01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,679
it's really really important

01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,199
so um having uh chris you know touch on

01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,880
open source licensing

01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,480
is just very important to us i'll tell

01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,040
you a real quick story before i turn it

01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,440
over to

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:11,040
to chris and it's just something that i

01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,080
think he's aware of but i don't mean to

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,640
embarrass him at all

01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,000
but this is a great story um again chris

01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,560
has been in the space for a little while

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,239
like me

01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,400
i've been in for more than 10 years 10

01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,560
to 15 years i saw chris speak at a

01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,440
conference in 2009

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,760
11 years ago it was in south carolina it

01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,080
was

01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,239
one of it was a linux fest that actually

01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,040
started out in south carolina

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,640
and uh anyway he gave a great talk he

01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,480
was there representing google of course

01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:41,040
his talk uh touched on gwt and android

01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,400
and wave and a few things like that i

01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,520
believe if min

01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,120
memory serves and those things

01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,760
again give you a little idea as to when

01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,840
that talk was was uh delivered

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,080
but anyway did a great job super nice

01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,159
person and funny and engaging

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,520
the room was packed of course but

01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,960
afterwards he did something that made a

01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,360
bigger impression on me than really the

01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,000
talk

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,640
and it was this um chris used to be and

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,800
and

01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,760
obviously still super popular and very

01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,400
well known

01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,360
but uh going back 10 years doing some

01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,400
things on tv

01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,239
this week in tech leo laporte many of

01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,560
you recognize that name

01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,520
um so again a lot of people around the

01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,159
country in the world

01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,960
immediately recognizable knew him and

01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,320
everything so

01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,440
a lot of people were excited at this

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,000
conference that he was going to be there

01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,239
speaking

01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,760
and a gentleman had his son with him and

01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,000
his son was very young but he was very

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,159
much

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,120
into tech and i could tell that the

01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,199
father and the son

01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,640
nervously approached chris and chris was

01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,159
probably on his way out

01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,440
but i happened to be standing there and

01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,560
i was curious because i'm always

01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,600
interested to see how people are going

01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,199
to respond to

01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,159
especially speakers and well-known

01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,000
people in the industry are going to

01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,520
respond to people that approach them

01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,280
and i will tell you this i didn't know

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,880
what to expect because i've seen

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,560
people handle that situation in

01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,840
different ways but that day

01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,080
chris stood there and talked to that

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,080
father and son for a long time

01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:59,199
and you were chris you were so nice to

01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,520
them and so kind and you were so nice to

01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,360
to his son and i could tell that that

01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,120
meant so much to that man

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,880
um that you would take the time and you

01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,159
were so engaging but

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,080
again i wasn't um weirdly listening

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,679
in i didn't mean to stalk you all or

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,880
again be weird about it

01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,080
you might have even noticed me but i

01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,960
couldn't help but overhear some of the

01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,640
conversation

01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,080
and that made such an impression on me

01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,239
so much of an impression

01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,760
that 11 years later i'm telling you

01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,120
about it before you deliver a keynote

01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,679
talk at all things open

01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,440
so being kind matters and being a really

01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,480
good person really does matter

01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,400
because you never know who you're

01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,000
influencing honestly i know that's

01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,719
cliche-ish and i know you

01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,400
everybody's heard that but it is so true

01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,239
and it made such a big impression on me

01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,040
again 11 years later i'm still talking

01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,480
about it so

01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,480
i happen to know you're a really good

01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,040
human being not only are you

01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,840
again whip smart and just you're just

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,840
very very

01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,520
obviously you're sharp and you've you're

01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,000
very accomplished but you're just a

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,760
really good

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,040
person and i was watching when no one

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,640
knew i was watching

01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,480
and that's always the tell on a really

01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,760
good human being so i don't mean i hope

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,800
that doesn't embarrass you i didn't mean

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,920
to put you on the spot

01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,440
uh you know you may not have uh again

01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,760
you may not have been expecting that in

01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,040
this context or delivered in that way

01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,199
but i did want people to know that

01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,480
you're just a good person and in the end

01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,400
isn't that all that's really going to

01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,000
matter uh and again i don't mean to wax

01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,960
philosophical this morning at a tech

01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,320
conference but

01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,360
in the end that really is sort of all

01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,080
that's going to matter and that's just

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,040
super important

01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,760
so with that an extended introduction

01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,440
but chris

01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,800
thank you for being with us we really do

01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,159
appreciate it uh

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,239
you've done a great job and it's a

01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:32,080
pleasure to have you again this keynote

01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:33,679
lineup is unbelievable

01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,280
and what a great way to end things off

01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,880
so with that i'm going to mute my

01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,480
microphone and my camera again and i'm

01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,159
going to yield the virtual stage to you

01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,199
chris

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,000
thanks a lot todd uh first i'd imagine

01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,400
that kid is

01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,360
is maybe going into college streaming

01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,840
his first year

01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,719
of college i wonder what he turned out

01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,320
to

01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:56,400
want to do anyway um let me uh

01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,679
share my little presentation here just

01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,840
one sec

01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,880
um i think you all should be able to see

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,239
that by now

01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,520
um okay uh i also want to take an issue

01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:08,000
with something todd said

01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,560
he said that licensing isn't like the

01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,920
coolest

01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:16,159
thing i i totally disagree licensing is

01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:19,360
is and has been a fundamental part of my

01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:20,400
my life and career and i i love software

01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,199
licenses i

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,640
even even commercial ones i i it's it's

01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,840
i used to give this talk about how to

01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,400
read a software license

01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,040
um and it's a super fun talk and and

01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,159
maybe i'll

01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,120
i'll re-give it seven years from now uh

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,400
the next time i

01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:39,360
i speak okay

01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,719
uh so i also want to thank angie sarah

01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,120
and martin i couldn't have asked for a

01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,960
better cohort of keynote speakers it was

01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,760
really great listening to y'all

01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,400
um and and yeah so let's get started so

01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,320
first of all

01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,080
before i get into the meat of the talk i

01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:55,920
like to actually lead my

01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,360
uh speeches with uh

01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,280
well should i be paying attention to q

01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,239
and chat no it blinks too much

01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,080
um i like to leave my speeches uh with

01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,760
the most recent release of open source

01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,159
software from alphabet

01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,960
so uh just 14 hours ago our verily

01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:11,199
division

01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,000
released a clinical trial simulation

01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,280
tool called

01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,920
metas so if you're currently planning a

01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:21,440
clinical trial for a vaccine

01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,679
for a you know a pandemic or something

01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,239
they put some really neat work into a

01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,880
set of jupiter notebooks and tools for

01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,600
basically

01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,040
simulating a clinical trial and for

01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,640
planning a clinical trial

01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,880
so check it out if you're interested in

01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,760
such things i'll paste a link in the

01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,080
chat

01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,120
it's it's on github under verily life

01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,120
sciences

01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,800
and medicine so and it's under the bsd

01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:46,159
license so

01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,960
what about licenses um so

01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,560
uh i'm going to talk about open source

01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,480
licenses and why it's really important

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,120
that we keep them the focal point of

01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,239
what we do in open source and i know

01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,520
you're thinking

01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:00,320
i'm at an open source conference i

01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,640
already like and no open source licenses

01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,360
but i like to remind people about the

01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,840
power

01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,400
that these licenses have to do so much

01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,360
more

01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,280
than just let us release some code uh or

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,360
put a lens of neutrality on code

01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,760
they give us so so much more than that

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:18,239
and as open source has grown

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,320
and been normalized in companies and the

01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:22,719
rest and in how developers work

01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,800
i think we've sort of forgotten how deep

01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,000
the freedoms offered by these licenses

01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,840
truly

01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,520
are and how far they go so

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,719
what makes open source really special

01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,480
when you compare to like i know

01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,600
commercial licensing or whatever

01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,440
is how we get to work with each other

01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,600
so i've been at google for about 16

01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,719
years now and people ask me is google

01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,280
still doing the open source thing and

01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,679
i'm like

01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,520
well yeah absolutely open source has

01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,159
been part of google since the very very

01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,920
beginning

01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:51,760
and one of the reasons i have always

01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,520
returned to

01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,760
open source is the primary part of my

01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,400
job is that

01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,800
you know i really like to return to open

01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,440
source

01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,480
people i like people who make free and

01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,640
open source software

01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,080
so much they're people who have a will

01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,400
to make things better for everyone

01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,480
through

01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,520
software and and through computing and i

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,239
think that's really special and it's

01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,600
something that i've

01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,679
wanted to be around and i keep being

01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:17,120
around and have been around for

01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,440
my entire career in in in computer

01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,120
science

01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,679
and the thing that lets us work together

01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:25,760
and what lets us build software

01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,719
are the licenses and that's why when i

01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,320
think of open source

01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,320
i always like whenever i see an open

01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,719
first news story or

01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,600
or a release on you know pick your

01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,600
favorite

01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,800
reddit hacker news whatever it might be

01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,120
uh or on twitter

01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,920
i always go okay but what license right

01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,880
uh

01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,159
so because the license tells me what i

01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,400
can do with this code

01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,840
now right what i don't have to ask

01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,120
permission to do

01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,560
so one of the first things i was asked

01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,600
to do at google when i got there many

01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,840
many years ago

01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,199
was to negotiate a license for computer

01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,159
vision project

01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:59,280
with a large west coast research

01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,639
university

01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:05,280
whose name rhymes with mamford uh so

01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:07,280
we were discussing who gets to use what

01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,800
how they get to use the software

01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,920
who has to give each other what kind of

01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,960
resources and it took about 11 months

01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,600
before

01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,440
we could just start coding together and

01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,080
i remember thinking the entire time like

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,600
why

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,760
why are they having the open source go

01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,440
to this negotiation

01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,520
this seems like a huge waste of time if

01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,120
we just had an open source

01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,040
project that we could just work on

01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,400
together we wouldn't have to do any of

01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,440
this stuff we wouldn't have to do any of

01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,960
this negotiation

01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,199
and it wasn't that the negotiation was

01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,600
bad or that anyone was a bad person

01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,239
it's just open source licenses take all

01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,679
this

01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,880
and get get gets all this trickiness out

01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,840
of the way

01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,960
uh so you know i largely concentrate on

01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,880
doing just that

01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,400
applying open source licenses and open

01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,480
sourcing stuff for a living

01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,920
and it's also why google loves open

01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,600
source software we don't have to

01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,639
struggle best through negotiations and

01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,320
waste time

01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,800
we can just get to work on the things

01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,800
that matter

01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,360
so open source is pretty popular now

01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:10,480
right and i'm really

01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,840
happy that it's become so normalized in

01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,960
the world of software development one of

01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,760
the great things about open source

01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,360
licenses

01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,239
is they tell you exactly what they mean

01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,000
so when i see an apache on a project

01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,920
everything i need to know about that is

01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,679
is right there in the license i know how

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,600
i can use it i can how i can modify it

01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:27,360
out what i have to do to distribute it

01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,280
and and everyone else has the same

01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,320
understanding for for these prominent

01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,480
licenses

01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,159
and it's really important it's why i'm a

01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,360
huge believer in the debris m3 software

01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,400
guidelines and the open source

01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,199
definition

01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,679
and because they really mean something

01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,080
to me

01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,400
but more importantly it's something that

01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:46,000
belongs to all of us

01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,239
so there are other licenses out there

01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,239
right and they introduce things like

01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,920
you know reselling fees or restrictions

01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,960
on cloud providers and all the rest and

01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,040
they're not wrong or

01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,000
bad or evil or anything it's not open

01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,800
source so

01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,440
when i say when we say an open source

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,480
project

01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,400
i think it's important that we're

01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,920
talking about real open source software

01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,280
covered by a real open source license

01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,400
that follow the guidelines from the open

01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,320
source initiative

01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,520
and the open source definition and these

01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,360
are the guidelines that help us work

01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,880
together

01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,719
so one of the things about doing open

01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,400
source for a really long time

01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,880
is you kind of start noticing that open

01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,639
source has a gatekeeping problem

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,159
and sometimes it's actually pretty

01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,920
intentional someone's trying to keep

01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,280
other people out of their project they

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,639
just want to do it themselves they don't

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,679
want to talk to anybody else or

01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,760
they want to keep it inside their

01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,719
company they want to keep control

01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,600
over that inside their company but

01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,120
sometimes

01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,880
it's just we're so used to operating as

01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,520
we do we don't realize we're not being

01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,199
inviting or welcoming to new new

01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,560
developers and new users

01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,960
so i i can't say a lot of good things

01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,679
about

01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,239
covid and the pandemic but one of the

01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,560
things that's happened because of covid

01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:54,159
is these events have all gone virtual

01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,360
and they've started attracting people

01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,920
who are

01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,280
not necessarily the people who would

01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,480
have come to this

01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,280
uh you know conference last year or

01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,719
next year so we'll get people from all

01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,400
over the world who are able to now

01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,840
attend these conferences

01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,840
and and so it's kind of a really

01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:17,600
great thing so instead of talking to the

01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:20,320
same group of people who maybe

01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,360
i would have seen at a given conference

01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,120
last year

01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,400
i'm able to talk to people all over the

01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,920
world and

01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,600
and here's the thing i

01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,120
think that open source could be doing a

01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:36,159
lot better a job of welcoming new users

01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,760
so we can avoid the unconscious

01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,600
discrimination now

01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,719
and we can recognize the hostility of

01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,719
doing things the way they've always been

01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:45,440
done we can use this time

01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,800
to change things like refusing to adopt

01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,320
a code of conduct or

01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,719
making an assumption that someone has

01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,440
time to search through and scan and

01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,400
scroll up a

01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,440
you know a like a whole raft of slack

01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,440
channels

01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,280
right we're assuming that they can work

01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,280
in the same time zone

01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,400
as as you are within a couple hours of

01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:06,320
your time zone

01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:07,520
um and and none of this is how we make

01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,320
software better together

01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:13,360
so so my uh my friend brian fitzpatrick

01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,960
he has this great metaphor about

01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,719
open source projects and groups being

01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,440
like circles right

01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,199
once you stand in a big circle and you

01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,000
focus internally on this project

01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,600
it's actually really really hard for

01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,560
anyone to break the circle

01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,080
and join right so you have to sort of

01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,840
you have to go pac-man as

01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,120
brian says you have to go pac-man you

01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,719
have to open up

01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,400
uh your circle so there's an entry point

01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,760
for others to join so

01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,000
we've run a couple programs at google

01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,920
that are about opening these circles

01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,520
first is the summer of code and the

01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,800
second of the season of docs

01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,400
they both give people who don't

01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,320
traditionally work on open source offer

01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,480
an opportunity to contribute upstream

01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,560
to learn and get involved in a project

01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,000
in the last 15 years we've had 15 000

01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,600
students from more than 100 countries

01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,719
participate in the summer of code and

01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,000
they've contributed more to 680 projects

01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,480
and we're in our second year of the

01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,320
season of docs and that's mentoring 80

01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,920
technical writers this year and they

01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,840
started with 44 last year

01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,960
so we shouldn't stop there though

01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,560
everyone should be thinking about how

01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,679
their projects can bring in new users

01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,600
and contributors

01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,120
you know uh sarah was talking about

01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,440
vue.js one of the things

01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,880
so i i make kind of fun of javascript

01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,239
for being very fashionable and having

01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,679
lots of frameworks and

01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,760
and all the rest but the thing about

01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,600
javascript is they're so

01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,199
welcoming to new developers and new

01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,480
users and it's so

01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:33,760
wonderful to see it and it's something

01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,320
that folks like sarah should be super

01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,199
proud of

01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,120
right anyways so i just wanted to point

01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,920
out we should be wary about how people

01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,199
want to take

01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,199
this amazing thing with yours open

01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:44,719
source and close it up so

01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,040
they'll take things not covered by the

01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,040
license and use that for control

01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,480
and to add additional restrictions on

01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,480
their open source projects

01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,080
like uh you know for a long time patents

01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,400
weren't even mentioned in most licenses

01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,400
and now they are

01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,840
but one thing that most licenses don't

01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,239
address is trademarks

01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,600
so let me give you some context uh last

01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:06,159
year alone

01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,679
googlers opened more than 150 000 pull

01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:09,360
requests on more than 70 000

01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,719
repositories on github

01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,639
it doesn't even count the thousands of

01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,360
other repositories we work in outside of

01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,719
github

01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:17,120
where we host major projects like

01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,480
android and chromium now that's a lot of

01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,239
open source contributions

01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,920
and because of that sheer size we tend

01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:24,639
to hit uh problems

01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,560
in open source faster than many in our

01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,320
office our open source programs office

01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,239
we get to use these experiences to help

01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,719
everyone in the open source community

01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,600
as well as google uh and with trademarks

01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,199
the problem we hit

01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,120
is that people shipping the software

01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:38,080
they need explicit permission to use the

01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,440
trademarks

01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,120
and this is an unaddressed problem in

01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,560
the licenses so

01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,920
we recently got together with some key

01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,360
open source contributors and computer

01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,080
scientists to create the open usage

01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,639
commons

01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,239
which which is working on creating

01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,239
trademark guidelines that conform to the

01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:54,239
open source definition

01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:57,520
so let's ask a question how can you tell

01:27:54,239 --> 01:28:00,480
if a project is really open source

01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,920
so let's talk about forking one of the

01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,960
most powerful things about open source

01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,920
licenses

01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,840
the real ones and how you can tell a

01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,239
project is actually open source

01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,040
is you are able to take that software

01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,960
fork it

01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,719
and go your own way i've heard people

01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,480
threaten to fork projects

01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,920
people threaten me like i'm gonna afford

01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,080
this project if you don't do this thing

01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,159
and i always respond the exact same way

01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,520
i said that sounds fantastic you should

01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,120
totally do that

01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,280
and it sometimes catches people by

01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,960
surprise a lot of people have this

01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,760
notion that forks are super super

01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,760
negative

01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,400
but forks are an incredibly important

01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,840
healthy uh part of open source software

01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,159
think about it so so the way i think

01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,440
about this okay is every time you ship

01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:42,159
something to a user

01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,520
a customer whatever that's a fork right

01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,880
because you're basically

01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,880
you're you're putting a flag in the

01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,120
ground saying okay we're

01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,239
we're gonna ship this thing right it's

01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,440
off the main trunk it's somewhere out

01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,080
there and someone's relying on that

01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,760
branch

01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,760
right so you just fork software

01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:58,480
congratulations

01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,520
and that means you're probably going to

01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,520
come up with new features and

01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,960
tools to work with that fork and that's

01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,239
super neat and here's the great thing

01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,320
about open source

01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:07,840
software licenses you can do that and i

01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,440
think our projects become stronger and

01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,120
healthier for that innovation

01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,639
and it's how we stay relevant with our

01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,760
users

01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,600
the other reason that forex are not a

01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,360
negative end-all be-all is that open

01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,960
source licenses allow these projects to

01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,080
come back together

01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,520
that they merge the fork back in so we

01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,159
had this happen with one external and

01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,600
android

01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,360
there was a time in android's history

01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,120
and i know this is gonna be super

01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,920
shocking to everyone who's ever used a

01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,639
cell phone

01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,199
where battery life kind of stunk right

01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,239
and

01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:38,719
linux and and batteries were in this

01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:40,639
sort of terrible relationship uh android

01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,960
needed a way to tell the kernel to tell

01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,040
the cpu to mellow out to to

01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,000
not come out of the low power states too

01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:49,120
aggressively

01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,880
and to use less battery now at the time

01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:52,159
this wasn't actually of much interest in

01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,760
the upstream kernel community that was

01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:56,639
largely concerned with server

01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,159
workloads but android users really

01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,679
really needed this so we've worked the

01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,360
kernel

01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,120
and some people were super upset about

01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,400
it and i i remember telling them the

01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,520
time listen

01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,520
we're going to come back together in a

01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,920
couple years and we're going to

01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,520
merge the best of both worlds and we're

01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,120
going to move on from there

01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,719
so and that's exactly what happened it

01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,719
took about two or three years

01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,239
but then wake locks got pulled into a

01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,000
new kernel structure that allowed for

01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:22,719
this kind of power management

01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,080
and you know because we were able to

01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,719
fork the kernel

01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,360
and then bring that back into linux we

01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:29,840
now have

01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,199
some two and a half billion devices

01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,560
running linux and android

01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,480
and that's incredibly powerful and that

01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,080
was only possible because it's

01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,320
really an open source project that you

01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:41,679
can fork and innovate with

01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,800
so uh so it's really an honor to be

01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,000
talking to you today it's an honor to be

01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,360
in the open source community

01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,639
and i'm really grateful to be talking to

01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,080
you today so if you remember nothing

01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,280
else from this stock remember this uh

01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,400
the open source license is all the

01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,080
permission you need

01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,440
uh with an open source license you can

01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,719
build the project you want

01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,320
the community you want to be a part of

01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,360
and work together with others so keep

01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,719
that at the center

01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:02,960
fork stuff and have fun um i think that

01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,480
i don't know if we have time for q a i i

01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,040
know todd

01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:09,040
had mentioned that we we could take

01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,440
questions here at the end

01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,320
chris um i don't i don't i don't think

01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,880
we've got

01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,400
time for like audience q a i i think

01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,639
what people will do

01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:20,480
is um here's here's what i'd like to do

01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,360
um i think you're going to head over to

01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,639
the google booth

01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:27,920
in the virtual exhibit hall yep i think

01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:29,360
so if uh if you could do that if that's

01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,320
not asking too much or if

01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,159
if that's still in your plan um people

01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,639
can kind of maybe navigate over to the

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,280
google

01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,880
uh booth in the virtual exhibit hall and

01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,080
they can chat with you there there's a

01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,520
chat feature

01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,520
chris you'll see people come to the

01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,040
booth and then if if you're an attendee

01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,719
you want to go over and chat with chris

01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,719
you can do that you'll actually see him

01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,440
there listed as a booth representative

01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,040
for google

01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,280
and you all can open up a chat stream

01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:55,199
there and chris you can also on your end

01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,760
you can even activate a video chat with

01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,440
someone

01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,480
if you want to open up a video chat so i

01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,000
don't want to put that you know you

01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:02,080
don't have to do that that's not

01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,199
victorian anyway sorry to put that

01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,760
burden on you

01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:07,360
uh and so i don't i certainly don't mean

01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,520
to do that but you can do that

01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:11,199
if you choose to do it so but thank you

01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,679
very much great talk

01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:14,960
extremely important topic again once

01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,960
again i'll say this again what better

01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,360
person to talk about it right

01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,719
again fantastic talk all these talks

01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,480
have been recorded so we'll make them

01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,199
available post event we'll move quickly

01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,280
on that

01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:26,880

topics

01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:31,040
and they can always view the recordings

01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,800
so we should have those out

01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,159
i don't know uh we're going to make uh

01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,159
you know a few of these are priorities

01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:37,520
simply due to the nature of the topic

01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:39,440
and we know the level of interest in

01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,520
these topics as well so we'll be

01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,120
notifying everyone across social media

01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,560
and then within our community so please

01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,159

um so um let me see let me remind you um

01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,840
there is a help desk on the virtual

01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,960
platform so

01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,400
if you're with us today as an attendee

01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,159
and you're sort of navigating around and

01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,000
you run in into anything that you don't

01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,760
know the answer to if you're running to

01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,280
you know you get stuck or if you just

01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,760
have a general question go to the help

01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,760
desk

01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,440
we do have a six connex technical person

01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,880
standing by if it's more of a technical

01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,480
platform related issue

01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,800
and then you can pose one to us directly

01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,560
if it's a more programming related issue

01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,840
or service related issue or something

01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,560
like that we're more than happy to help

01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,880
you out

01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,000
um and let's see if there's anything

01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,159
else i don't believe there's

01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,120
oh one last thing do keep in mind the

01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,600
leaderboard

01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,719
uh as you're you know engaging in

01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,320
activity around the site you're

01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,440
accumulating points this is something

01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,920
new we're doing this year

01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:15,440
but it was super successful yesterday

01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,400
and earlier before we started the

01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,159
keynote block

01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,679
if you remember if you were with us i

01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,960
showed you the winners the top five

01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:23,679
winners from yesterday

01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,360
so we started uh everything from scratch

01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,199
today we sort of wiped the leaderboard

01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,000
and we started from zero for everybody

01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,520
today so

01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,280
be sure to check it out you can click on

01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,800
the trophy icon

01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,480
and kind of see where you're stacking up

01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,000
and how many points you're accumulating

01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:38,159
kind of a neat thing again we didn't

01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,440
want to i don't know be hokey about it

01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,480
or anything like that but we just kind

01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,400
of thought it was neat

01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,400
and something to do to make the platform

01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,679
more fun but with all that being said

01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,600
we'll go ahead and keep this webinar

01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,159
live until 10 30 for another five

01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,920
minutes

01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,840
so if you want to stay on again post

01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,639
questions to sarah angie or chris in the

01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,159
chat stream

01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,000
you know chris is then heading over to

01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:57,600
the google exhibit booth uh in the

01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,840
virtual exhibit hall

01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,360
and you can chat with chris there so and

01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,880
then you can always follow a post event

01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:05,199
