a unique year like 2020 has been for us

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,599
because we do not have quarterly

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
pressures of reporting to wall street it

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319

services to our customers

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,800
you could say we have a startup attitude

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
without the risk

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
i mentioned to you that um we are a

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,880
healthcare organization i just want to

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,680
briefly give you two examples on

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
where we help our customers um to meet

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,279
or

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,200
to just from to go or to meet our

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
mission statement

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
we offer healthcare benefit

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
administration to our clients

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
one of the major worries our clients our

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,760
employers have is

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,360
offering the best health care plans to

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
the employees

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
if you look in the industry 60 percent

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,440
of the employees

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,399
they are not confident of the plan they

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
have chosen

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,440
that is 60 which is very surprising

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
at fidelity we are investing heavily

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,000
into this and we have cr we have created

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
a proprietary decision support tool

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,720
based on artificial intelligence to help

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,360
our customers to choose the right plan

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
another example briefly on the startup

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
attitude is medicare

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
medicare is a federal health health

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,120
insurance program

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
that is created for individuals with 65

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
and older

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
or with certain disabilities or medical

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,040
conditions

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,440
there are multiple plans in each state

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,760
and it is very complex to navigate

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
at fidelity we are building a brand new

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,880
platform

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
a digital platform with cloud native

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
from ground up

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
to help our customers to select the

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
right plan and navigate through this

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,959
complex

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,480
process we empower our associates to

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,680
focus on new

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,600
forward thinking ideas from big data to

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,920
mobile to cloud

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
and our teams work in every time zone

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
you can think of

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,560
around the world and we use the latest

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,720
video on social media technologies

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
technology opportunities are humongous

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
they start from

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,440
java to ai to cloud computing cyber

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
security data engineering i can keep on

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
going on

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,519

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,519

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
wide variety of projects some are

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,120
aspect of the architecture and the

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,720

make sure that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,240
the applications are meeting the current

racial equality this year as far as

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,600

and being given as a learning day uh and

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
being provided

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
a lot of resources to learn uh such as

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,519
you to me

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,519
and um

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,759
i can't remember the next one is but

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,759
there's a lot of resources available for

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,959
use for us to learn

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,600
there's also a website where

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,199
they have gigs that have been provided

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,639
certain technologies have ideas that

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
they want to see implemented but don't

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,320
have the time to fully see it through

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,440
and organic teams form and start

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
developing the idea

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
and see it to completion making sure

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,000
that it's implemented and released

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
i also i've used the career coaching

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
experiences

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
where they have career coaches available

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
to mentor you through

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
whatever career questions you may have

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,079
and that has helped them

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,000
that has helped me tremendously in

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:23,199
growing my uh career professionally

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
we additionally have a growing open

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
source team

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,519
where we're looking for ways for

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,040
fidelity to contribute back to the

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,440
community

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,720
as well as looking for open source

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,000
projects that

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,959
can help fidelity grow

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
and finally i have switched several

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,519
roles

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,079
and fidelity continues to encourage me

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,920
to try different things and that's a big

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
part of why i got into technology in the

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,519
first place

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
i don't like working on the same thing

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,680
over and over again

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
and being able to feel encouraged to try

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
different roles and

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
different technologies in different

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,639
areas

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,839
keeps me engaged and keeps me learning

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,959
not only technology but the business

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,039
um as far as my work-life balance

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
uh i really enjoyed the like work-life

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,240
balance that we have here in

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,559
fidelity i just i think west showed the

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,280
maternity leave benefit that we have i

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,199
just i was able to make use of that so

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,799
i'm feeling refreshed after almost a

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,039
month off

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,320
um my my tribe lead keeps mentioning

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,160
his motto as always to keep it cool and

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,960
fidelity supports that by providing a

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
lot of

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,840
resources such as paid time off we have

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
had a lot of benefits that are

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
not typical this year but i've been able

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,200
to utilize

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,039
which is fitness reimbursements

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
so we can work out now that the gyms are

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,440
closed and a lot of

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,760
mental health resources uh for the

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,120
stress that this year has caused

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,480
so that's that's it for me and my

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,559
experience is here i'll

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,679
send it over to soma and she'll talk

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,960
about her career experiences

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,160
thank you sergio so i would start with

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,799
at some point

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,640
in our lives most of us had to find our

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,720
own path our own way of doing something

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
our sense of who we are within a

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
relationship or a career path

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
that makes sense for us so good morning

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,400
everyone

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,280
my name is suma mishra i'm very excited

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
to be here

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,240
among you all and looking forward to

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,640
share my own experience

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
i always wanted a career for myself

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
which would be exciting

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
fast-paced and challenging i joined

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,799
fidelity in the year of 2015

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,679
as a system analyst my role of system

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,559
analyst

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,720
evolved during the course of time i got

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,400
exposure to different ways of working

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,200
and thought process

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,440
such as a relentless focus on

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
continuously trying to improve on

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
everything

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,799
we do as part of a job basically our job

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,120
is never done

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
and our customers are expecting every

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,840
day more and more from us

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
so there has been a constant

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,320
encouragement to be a creative business

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
thinker

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
and be innovative in our role and there

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
is a

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
continuous focus on reinvent all the

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
things that we have been doing

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,600
either reinvent all of our existing

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,160
processes

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,559
or also push into areas that we haven't

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,520
necessarily participated in

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,360
so which this gave me a very different

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,280
turning point in my career

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,200
because many people think that

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,679
innovation equals technology

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
but it doesn't necessarily of course we

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,080
need technology to support

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,600
innovation but the core innovation may

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
not be technology

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,360
and this is where as i said it triggered

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,679
me to navigate more towards

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
product management from a system analyst

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,640
role

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,400
the product management gave me an

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
opportunity to reinvent

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
new products which would provide a

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,159
different way

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,480
of meeting the needs in a new way to our

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,960
customer

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,200
then there is another concept which i

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,240
got introduced to called vitality

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
and this is this is a very key

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
word which our senior leadership always

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,159
uses

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,799
and the word vitality means doing new

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,760
things

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,400
or doing all things in a new way which

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,400
is more

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
tightly coupled with our day-to-day

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
deliverables

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,280
and that gave me an aspiration to look

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,240
into the

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,760
role of squad lead so this role the

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,559
particular squad lead role

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,039
helped me in defining what needs to be

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,480
done

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,520
on a daily basis to keep ourselves fresh

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,880
and be responsive to our customers delhi

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,960
as one of the criteria uh was mentioned

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
as customer obsession which is one of

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
our leadership principle as well

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,760
so all this thought process of working

00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,880
new ways definitely redefined my career

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,120
and made me to explore different areas

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,000
by playing different roles and that's

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,280
how my

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,720
career journey embarked infidelity i'd

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,559
also like to say here

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,880
it's not only the thought process of

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,799
working or doing things in a new way

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,720
but there has always been a constant

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,480
encouragement from senior leadership

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,400
team on mobility

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
and the idea behind mobility is

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
definitely to make people more

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,159
productive

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,640
and give them an opportunity to learn

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,480
businesses through different lenses that

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,679
comes by playing different roles in the

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
organization

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
so this has always been foster and

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
encouraged

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,520
and for which we have a lot of career

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,919
centers been established in our company

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,440
and that gives an opportunity to meet

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,480
with senior managers

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
from different parts of the

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
organizations and to talk about your

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
career plan

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,679
now it could be and simply an

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,440
informational gathering session

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,200
or it's a great chance to bounce your

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
ideas off to somebody

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
who's more experienced and get their

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
guidance

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,720
so when you get into new role there is

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
often times when people don't know

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,640
you but it's a clean slide for you to

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,039
create your own branding

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
because sometimes people tend to presume

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
about you

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
and it tends to be either extreme or the

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,360
other

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
but as any work environment people has

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,480
to show off their work

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,679
do their best and contribute to the

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,520
business

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,400
so three things i definitely want to

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,480
highlight is that shaped up my career

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
is a culture of innovative ways of

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,360
working

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
thought process of fidelity's leadership

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,520
principles

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,520
huge encouragement on mobility and there

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,720
is always an opportunity for you to

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,159
create your own

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,760
own branding and reinvent where wherever

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,240
you want to go on

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
so and then another aspect that i want i

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,559
want to highlight here

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,880
is also there is a lot of uh opportunity

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,159
membership opportunity either in erg

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,240
employee resource group

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,240
or weed sick this is where you can

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,039
create your own networking and you get

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,120
to know

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,640
that what are other areas that you can

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,200
venture off

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,760
so the key mantra that i would like to

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
mention

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,000
here is always always trust your

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,840
instincts now a lot of people will give

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
you advice depending upon

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,200
how well they know you which could be

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,039
valid or not valid

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
but at the end of the day you know

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,679
yourself best what will work

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
so don't doubt yourself stay looking

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
ahead stay committed

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
and stay true to yourself and this is

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,440
the company which will definitely help

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
in shaping up your career and what

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,440
unique individualism

but also help you help you grow your

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799

during this pandemic

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,080
um as i mentioned these are just a

sampling

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
of our opportunities we see a plethora

from some of the skills we look for as

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,120
sergio mentioned we are

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400

as well as staying up to date as rao

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,880
mentioned we are leaning into

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
cloud deployments making sure our ci cd

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
pipelines

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,919
are as up-to-date and automated as

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,240
possible um everything from

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,919
angular 10 to you know the newest

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,720
version of java that is what we are

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,120
seeing

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,760
uh outside of that that's not listed

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
here

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,039
is some of the different business units

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,520
as rao mentioned we

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,360
have many many different technology

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,039
organizations within fidelity

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
some of those could be our enterprise

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,320
cloud computing some of those are our

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
enterprise cyber security our center of

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
applied technology

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,520
fidelity labs where a lot of proof of

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,360
concept work goes on

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
as sergio mentioned our charitable

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,159
organization which develops technology

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,640
specifically for

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,760
charity work and then also our digital

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,600
assets which is a

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,960
very trending topic right now within

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
cryptocurrency

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
uh if you have any questions feel free

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
to find my information on linkedin

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
i'd be happy to share some of that with

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,080
you and uh you know help you get

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,840
into the right hiring manager's eyes

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,120
i believe next what we have to go

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,000
through is our

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
q a i saw a few different questions pop

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,799
up and i think wes

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
is going to lead us through that if you

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,480
have any questions please put that

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
in the channel or feel free to raise

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
your hand and we'll address your

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,840
questions accordingly

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
thank you again for attending

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
thanks al looks like we've got a little

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
bit of a variety of questions some

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,279
around

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
policy and updates given some of the

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,919
changes this year and some for the

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,760
technologists and

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,960
panelists so we'll go through a couple

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
of these

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,640
one question that we got here after the

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,520
pandemic will your working location

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,159
policy be going to a blended model

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,039
or optional fully remote verse fully

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
office

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,960
what i can tell you is i think that's

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
still undecided in some ways

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,200
so fidelity is is really big on culture

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,600
as you could hear from not just

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
a technology and building working

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,919
relationships but from the employee

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,840
resource groups from the personal

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
um advantage you get from from working

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,919
in the office at the same time

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
safeties are our top priority right now

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,039
so

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,640
not only are is our timeline flexible on

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,679
when we're actually going to go back to

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
the office

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,320
but eventually we would want uh people

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,840
to be in the office the groups can make

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
a little bit of a decision there as we

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
know most

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,720
technology roles can be done at least

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,960
portion remote

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
so i have heard some situations where

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
maybe with tenure

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
depending on the group there's a little

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,159
bit more of a remote flexibility but

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,600
i think in all likelihood talking to to

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
most of my managers and i think some of

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,559
the leaders on here maybe would

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,360
would agree feel free to chime in but i

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,799
think um being able to

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,919
be here interact grow with each other

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
learn with each other

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
is a really big part of fidelity in our

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,480
culture so

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,559
ideally back back into the office

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,000
a second question here learning tuesday

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,679
sergio i believe you talked a little bit

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
about that or you mentioned that can we

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
hear

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,840
a little bit more detail and it can be

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,640
from you it could be from from one of

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,320
our leaders

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,080
what exactly is that is there a little

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,520
bit of flexibility to learn just maybe a

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
little bit more detail on on what a

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,679
learning tuesday is

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,799
sure um so for me it's it's

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,320
really meant uh as eight hours a week of

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,840
uh professional development right uh so

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,399
like i mentioned uh there's a sum total

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,320
uh which is an internal learning course

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,440
that they have online courses and

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,200
in-person

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:41,279
instructor-led courses we have access to

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,000
uh linkedin learning we have pluralsight

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,880
we have just a variety we have also a

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,399
level up

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
we call it it's an internal website

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,039
where people can have sessions

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
with where people can just sign up and

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,640
listen to them speak and and teach

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,679
whatever subject they've chosen to

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,600
have people attend um and

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,360
there are no expectations as to

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,799
uh what kind of self-development you

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,159
want to take it doesn't have to be

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,520
specifically related to

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,159
your current role um the the only

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
expectation

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,760
is that you continue to grow and are

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
satisfied with the the work that you're

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
doing

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
yeah so subject if you again if i may

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,120
right so one of the the reason we

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,200
created this one is if you know we all

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,039
are busy working our day-to-day stuff so

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,320
we wanted to really carve out certain

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,159
amount of time

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,919
for associates individual growth and

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,480
that's what these learning tutorials are

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,360
for

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,120
as sergio said it's your time again you

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,559
could you can work with your manager to

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,720
work through this stuff but there are no

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,000
real expectations and then our tests or

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,679
anything like that

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,200
the other thing also aspect i want to

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,600
throw it out is

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
technology is changing rapidly right so

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,559
the technology we have right now

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
in three years down the road is going to

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,000
change what we're also working on is

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,520
something called a skills framework

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,039
wherein we develop saying that these are

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,520
the skills that you have

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,520
this is where we wanted to go and then

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,039
these learning days will help you enable

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,640
to get that staff on it so that's

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,640
another aspect of the learning tuesdays

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,880
too

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
awesome appreciate that perspective um

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
another question here

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,360
what is the most important value you

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,159
look for

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,159
when hiring candidates uh soma maybe

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,600
maybe that's a good question for you

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,240
so yeah so again the answer is very

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,520
simple

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,200
um it's not something

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,640
definitely the skill set would need to

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,799
match uh the

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,960
ask of the job requirement the job

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,640
description but in terms of the value

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
it's morally you bring your own

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,880
individualism to the office

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,559
what is that you're passionate about

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,640
what is that is motivating

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,399
so make sure that you're up to date with

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
the technology or the work

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,399
and then bring your innovative skills to

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,760
the work bring something

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,679
uh which which has been working or which

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,399
has not been working and look into how

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
do we

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,120
reinvent those existing process so that

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,519
we will be able to meet our customer

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,399
needs as i said vitality is one of the

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,320
key fact

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,679
which we are going back and looking into

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,279
many of our systems

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,039
because things have been working very

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,600
differently even yesterday

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,880
when i come into work today i see things

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
in a different lens

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
so all those kind of perspectives that

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,399
are attitude how

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,080
we want to make our customers happy

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,880
because they are the one who are relying

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,679
on us

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
is take our customers requirement very

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,399
seriously

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,840
on a personal note and then think

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,840
through how well you can best serve it

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,480
all that doesn't brow anything you'd

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200
like to add there no that was great that

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,720
was great

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,120
anything else any panels would like to

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
add no i think a soma card did well

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,840
again we are as

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,559
as the mentioned previously multiple bus

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,960
the one we

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,799
all align on is our own customer it's

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,039
the customer obsession on it

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,960
so bring in your ideas as you said your

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,039
innovative head to help our customers

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
that's what it unites we all get united

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,840
on

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,360
awesome our next question up here does

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,159
fidelity hire full-time and contract

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,640
opportunities

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,519
al i will let you take that one

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,519
absolutely

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,120
um as rao has mentioned all of our

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,279
business units work

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,799
independently from one another but also

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,399
shoulder to shoulder with each other to

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,840
support our customers

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,440
and some of the ways we hire definitely

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,360
will change between the business units

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,360
we hire full-time opportunities

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,960
on the other end of the spectrum we hire

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,200
individual contract roles

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,159
and in between we have contract to hire

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,039
opportunities

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,559
it really depends as the team is growing

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,960
what the initiative look like

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,559
how that comes through hr is how it is

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,200
approved but we have like i mentioned

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
earlier

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,799
over 150 full-time positions we also

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,960
have a whole team

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,480
dedicated to our contract work uh

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,559
fidelity talent source

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,760
and so sometimes in my conversations if

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,600
i have a

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
candidate who is interested only in

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,039
contract work then i'll work with my

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,640
peers within fidelity talent source to

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,559
help find them a hope there

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,320
um on the flip side they do the same for

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,000
me and if someone's only seeking

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,279
full-time engagements then that's when

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
i'll step in and help them

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,399
so we do hire in all different plethora

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
of

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,519
opportunities and something i wanted to

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,000
go back to wes

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
you mentioned the remote work from that

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,159
first question

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,840
i wanted to let everyone know on the

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,360
panel that i was actually hired in the

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,080
middle of this pandemic

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,320
and the onboarding was extremely smooth

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,880
i had my peers help me ramp up

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
and get to a successful level so that i

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,840
can impact the business

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
so that's something else that i think

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,240
was top of mind when i was looking for a

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,440
job

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,679
is how am i going to not only engage

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,720
with my peers virtually but also provide

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,320
value to them

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,559
and something that i really was

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,120
astounded by was fidelity's

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,799
i guess you could say uh determination

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,200
to make sure that i was successful

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,080
virtually so uh yeah i think that kind

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,600
of answers the question

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,080
there awesome

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,480
appreciate that uh quick question we got

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,960
does fidelity sponsor employees that are

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,840
on a work visa currently the answer to

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,960
that is yes

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,320
we definitely do we got for the

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
technologist another question

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,839
here how has working remote been so far

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,079
from a technology perspective

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,480
sergio maybe get your get your opinion

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,480
on that one

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,720
at first it was a bit of a a challenge

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,079
just because

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,320
um i'm used to having my peers

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
uh that sitting next to me and being

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,639
able to just

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,720
turn around and speak to them um but

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,280
now it's been i'm actually quite

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,480
comfortable uh we received a stipend to

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,919
make sure that our home office

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,280
environment was

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,240
uh up to par you know and and we have

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,599
technologies

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,560
um available for us to work in

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,800
a very efficient way asynchronously so

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,160
i'm able to send out emails or ims or

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,320
maybe we have a new technology

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,760
yammer which is more of a social

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,599
platform just to

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,440
get that social interaction that working

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,119
from home

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,400
kind of takes away so it has evolved

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,240
quite nicely and i'm able to do my my

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,720
job efficiently at home

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,760
and personally i like to have some quiet

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,320
space whenever i'm

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,960
you know deep into a particular problem

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,040
so

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,079
you know just being able to put on my

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,800
headphones and

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,920
on um code for an hour and a half

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,680
straight without

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,839
really an interruptions it's been pretty

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,839
nice

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,800
i can tell you from a talent acquisition

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
perspective you know we definitely have

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,359
picked up the zoom meetings

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,200
and we stayed connected that way so we

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,359
haven't really missed out on too much

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,960
but a similar experience on my end

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,960
working virtually

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,480
calls and video chatting with candidates

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,560
as much as possible meeting with

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,280
managers to talk about open roles and

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,480
partnering with al from a talent

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
sourcing perspective

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,680
has been i think just as smooth even

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,400
working

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,119
virtually from from talent acquisition

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,920
we have

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,280
a couple of questions that are a little

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,960
more specific

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
towards getting connected about a

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
certain opportunity or something like

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,440
that

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,119
what i'll recommend just for for a

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
couple of those as a whole

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,280
if you want to reach out to al ryan feel

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
free to make the linkedin message myself

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,400
as well

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,839
the ideal situation i think would be get

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,440
connected with somebody on our talent

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,079
acquisition or strategic sourcing team

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
so

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,440
we could have an individual conversation

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,359
talk about your goals

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,880
interest what would be maybe most

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,359
relevant within fidelity and then share

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,920
those opportunities with you

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,440
um everybody can also jump by our booth

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,560
to an exhibit hall

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,839
west um if you want to share that yeah

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,920
thanks ashley yeah we

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,599
we had one more location question i

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,119
wanted to address really quick

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,800
are you hiring remotely for other

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,440
locations at this time or would it be

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,440
required to move to that location

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,560
somewhat similar to our question but i

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,880
guess a little difference

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,320
here that maybe i didn't mention before

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,960
sometimes our groups

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,599
are working in multiple locations so you

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,000
could have

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,000
a squad or a software engineering team

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,880
that might have a few associates in our

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,359
boston office

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,119
as well as our north carolina office as

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,160
well as our texas office

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,880
so i would always say you know

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,240
shoot your shot as they they say put the

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
application in see if you can get

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,520
connected with someone

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,040
there might be some flexibility based on

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,640
where the team is located

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,880
as to what location might be relevant

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,079
but eventually once again when it is

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,079
safe to do so

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,839
we would ideally like people to be able

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,839
to go into the office

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,640
let's see other questions

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,560
got a question around how the

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,359
organization is governed

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,560
and can others move into leadership

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,880
positions

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,240
i would maybe take this question i'm

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,079
gonna probably throw this to either rao

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
or or stoma maybe a little bit more

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,359
about

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,640
how you went um into your leadership

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,440
role would maybe be a good way to

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,040
approach that so

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,880
i see you unmuted real quick so maybe

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,040
you want to jump on this one sure

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,040
this is this is one of the best question

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,079
uh yeah now you can jump in as well but

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,760
i'll start with

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,880
um every individual is a leader

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,599
no matter where where you are in the

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,160
in the organization you are a leader you

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,920
are coming

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,599
every day to work with your leadership

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,599
qualities and attributes

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,119
and then take our customers very

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,560
seriously and personally

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,960
so there has been a tremendous

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,520
opportunity in this organization as i

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,599
said

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,200
i mean starting whether irrespective of

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,160
which grade or where you are

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,000
in a squad you are a leader now there

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,560
are various leadership principles as i

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,880
said i mean innovation is one of the

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,599
aspect the second thing is you own the

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,440
outcome

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,720
if you see there is an opportunity for

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,480
you

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,400
to prove yourself or do things

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
differently take it up

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,480
step up show the leadership a teacher

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,040
and then move on

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,720
create your own branding your work

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,960
should speak for yourself

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,640
and that's where you will get recognized

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,960
and trust me as i said

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,839
trust your own instincts never doubt

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,480
yourself

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,200
always stay alert stay committed to your

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,200
your work

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,000
and you will definitely reach where you

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,760
want to be in your career

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,280
so rao anything you want to add here

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
thank you so much you caught it very

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
well so

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,359
um again sky is the limit we are an

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,520
agile shop

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,400
again we believe in servant leadership

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,200
so

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,280
everybody's a leader um and then take

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,240
the white spaces and excel i'm a true

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,599
example myself like 95 i was a software

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,480
engineer and then i grew through the

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,400
ranks

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,160
at fidelity we focus a lot on vitality i

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,560
know soma covered this stuff earlier

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,200
there are multiple bus and then you

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,359
could just go

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,200
work from one bu to another it is

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,680
totally different kind of an experience

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,320
on it

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,200
and then all of these jobs are posted

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,280
internally

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,720
again you have all these networking

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,800
sessions that you could partner through

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,960
it so there are so many opportunities

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
um that you could excel go from

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,880
technology to business

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,760
business to technology again lateral as

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,680
well as

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
a ladder perspective too so ton of

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,200
opportunities

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,280
and being on the other end of the

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,920
spectrum obviously soma and rao have

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,720
achieved the the climbing the ladder so

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,640
to speak

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,240
with being at fidelity for less than six

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,480
months within my first week

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,400
i could see that the ownership mindset

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
was extremely um

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,400
impactful and that's something that i've

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,040
seen over the last few months as someone

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,880
put it

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,640
you have to own your your work and

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,040
really work hard and prove yourself and

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
that's

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,200
exactly how you can kind of have your

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,480
voice heard we also have a career

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,720
opportunity center

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,319
where you can go in and set up meetings

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,319
where you talk with other leaders

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,160
and just gain insight on how they did

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,839
their their background you know how they

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,920
move from within business units

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,960
how they achieve that upward mobility so

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
that's a whole

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,119
different category that you can set up

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,240
20 to 45 minute conversations with other

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,160
senior leadership

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:06,560
and seek to understand their story and

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:08,480
how it can impact you

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,880
awesome thanks everyone any uh

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,640
last-minute questions here

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,240
feel free to type some of those in i

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,200
think we are

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,119
pretty much through them at this point

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,920
yeah and we're wrapping up on time to

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,760
west if anybody has specific um

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,480
questions they didn't get the chance

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,319
to ask in this particular forum or they

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
wanted to connect with a technologist

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,560
individually too

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,319
we are in the exhibit hall we have a ton

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,839
of information on our booth it will link

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,440
you to our jobs page

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,240
we also have some information on some of

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
those ergs and sigs of special interest

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,079
groups

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,319
if those are something that interests

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,440
you as well and are important to

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,000
our culture and you want to see what

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,359
that's like please take a visit over to

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,880
the booth as well

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,720
you can chat with individuals while

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,319
you're at the booth it also will link

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,599
you to the ability to join our talent

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
network

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,480
if you join the talent network if you

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,119
don't see a job that fits your

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,520
particular skill set right this second

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,119
it would be good to join that network

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,880
and you're alerted when jobs do come

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,599
around as well as other

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,400
important areas for your career growth

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,599
and what's happening

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,480
happening at fidelity so

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,280
we did have one final question around

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,800
releases

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,640
does anybody want to jump that one real

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,960
quick while we still have another two

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,960
minutes

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,400
yeah maybe i can chime in here so again

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,599
releases

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,880
we are working in a very uh dynamic and

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,480
uh versatile environment squad releases

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,800
are very continuous

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,720
so depending on how well what we have

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,400
planned in our given sprint

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,240
and what we are doing is we definitely

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,960
do not want to get into a big bank

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,880
release

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,400
like every four months or three months

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,640
and then do a big release

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,480
but rather take an incremental approach

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,560
so it's a continuous integration

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,319
continuous development that we kind of

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,359
foster in our release

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,839
culture and it is our sprints are

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,760
two weeks so the releases could be every

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,480
one or two weeks or two to three weeks

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
maximum

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,240
and it's an incremental approach so if

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,480
you have released increment one

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,599
the next sprint would focus on adding

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,680
the increment to

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,760
so that both increment one and two will

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,760
give a clear and holistic picture

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,240
to our customers to be able to leverage

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
our product

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,240
thank you summer that's a that's a great

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,680
answer and i know that that can also

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,040
often prompt some more questions about

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,800
how things are done

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,640
more operationally so again if you want

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,280
to connect on those please visit our

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,000
booth

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,920
and connect with some of the

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,280
technologists over there and you're

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,800
welcome to have those conversations in

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
more detail

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,359
but we wanted to make sure that we

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,400
thanked you for attending this

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,560
session as well as our panelists i could

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,040
not think of a better collective set of

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,040
minds to walk us through what fidelity

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
does on a day-to-day basis and

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,599
especially our leadership principles i

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
think that

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,640
the leaders on this call in particular

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,520
have embodied those and shown them

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,240
through their career

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
so they speak them from experience not

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,800
just from a slide

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,640
so please know that we are happy to talk

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,640
to anybody about any other opportunities

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,319
that they may be interested in fidelity

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,920
