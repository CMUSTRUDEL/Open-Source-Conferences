Presented at All Things Open 2020 - International Track

Abstract: Sustainability is always a big question for many open source projects. Limited resources, undefined culture, lack of a common goals or visions, lack of maintainers, no backup, poor documentation, politics, internal conflicts, external attackers or trolls, and unwillingness to collaborate with enterprises are challenges that prevent open source projects to grow. Hong Phuc Dang shares the story of FOSSASIA; the lessons she learned on how to engage contributors from Asia; how to sustain and scale open source projects with limited resources; and ideas to monetize an open source project in order to grow based on a real example of PSLab.

hi

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,040
everyone um first of all i would like to

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
thank the organizer

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,880
for inviting me to speak today i'd

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,039
really appreciate um a chance to share

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
with you about an open source community

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,279
in asia

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,199
that we have been building um over a

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,680
decade now

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
but um before that a little bit about

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,200
myself

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,640
um i am originally from vietnam

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,280
i drew up in a place called kanto

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
maybe many of you have not heard about

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
it

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,840
but it is the biggest city in the mekong

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,120
delta in style vietnam

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,930
let me see if i can open up

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,030
the map to show you one moment

00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,030
[Music]

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,160
sales ring

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,720
yeah so if you can see it's my dreams at

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,320
the bottom here you can see

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,640
the little red dogs it can tell yeah

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
so

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
a very large portion of this area

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
actually covered by the water from the

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
mekong river

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,119
this region is considered as

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
a biological treasure trove of the

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
country

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,360
the home of a thousand of animal

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,680
and plants business the mekong delta

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
is also known a derived basket of

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
vietnam

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,759
contributing more than half of the

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,600
nation's rice production

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,399
so life for me was simple and easy

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
my parents were not rich at that time

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
but

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
we always had enough to eat yeah so

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
you can imagine the word the weather is

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,240
super pleasant

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
and nice when you drop something on the

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,280
rail it will grow and become food

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
and so it's quite easy

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
for the people who live there so we were

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,480
also very lucky

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:19,360
as i grew up i became more aware of

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
the problems happening around us

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
one of the things that i noticed i can

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,959
share with you

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,680
this photo so if you um just

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,959
curious and look at by child look for

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
the mekong delta

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,840
so some of the images similar like this

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
will come

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,000
up the mekong river is getting more and

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
more

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
polluted every day and in the recent

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,480
report

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
scientists predicted many provinces in

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,360
this region

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
will be completely floated by the year

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,720
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,720
due to climate change

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
as we know many of the world's problems

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
are caused by

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,280
irresponsible actions of us human strain

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
i personally believe that people when

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,159
people are more educated

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,760
we could be more responsible to our

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
environment

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,319
but unfortunately as

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,400
a developing nation we certainly

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
do not have a good education system

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,800
until today

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,239
many people in the country still have

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,720
limited access to to education

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,040
and a small number of colleagues or

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,480
universities are reserved for people

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,000
for more privileged backgrounds

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,080
in our government as many other

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
countries

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,400
they are very corrupted in many levels

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,840
and of course they are not capable

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,480
of solving society problems

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,319
and the people like us and people from

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
the royal from the community we lack of

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,519
means

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,280
and expertise to be a solution from

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,159
bottom up ourselves

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,120
and at that time when i was still in

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
high school

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
as a young student i did not see a clear

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
path

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,519
for what i would want to achieve in my

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
life

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
before my home likes commit com

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
completely

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,320
goes on underwater so until

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,080
um one day and

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,280
and when i get into university

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,720
i moved from canto to hanoi the capital

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
of vietnam

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,520
and in the year 2007

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,360
i attended a free and open source events

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,919
organized by the eu

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
i was a translator at that time for one

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,560
local company

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,160
at that conference i met my partner

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
mario belling

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,040
a long-term force contributor who

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,680
really inspired me with his energy and

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
passion

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
for open source and the way he talked

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
about

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,560
equal opportunity for

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,880
foreign for the society so i was

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,039
very interested in the whole idea of

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,639
open source and their freedom

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,680
is give to us in the following year

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,800
i got a chance to

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,080
complete my study in singapore during

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
this year i got connected with the

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,039
local linux user group i started to

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
involve regular

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,680
with many user groups in in singapore

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,800
also studied to contribute like

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
many small projects for localization

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
and got connected through the open

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
source people

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
got connected to many other communities

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
around the world

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
and i also learned from people that i

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,919
met

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,680
from from this group how to do coding

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,400
coding how to

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
work with open source and contribute to

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,520
different projects

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,319
within three years i become

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,160
more and more active and i i consider

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
myself at that time as an open source

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
activist

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,280
as i went out talked to people and was i

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
was so proud that i used

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,840
ubuntu and introduced like different

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,000
software that i have on my machine

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,600
because uh of of that i also shared some

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720
articles um

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,919
um on the blog and i got invited to

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,400
um to participate in an

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
other open source event in europe that

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,360
was also the first time i got

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,840
um uh to get into another um

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
part of the world through open source

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
and i see this

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
as a potential so a potential

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,160
opportunity

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,960
that can help me to

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,919
to direct my my life future in a

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,319
different way

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,520
and i also see a lot of potential that

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,560
can help us

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
to solve the problem that we have living

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
right now

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,919
through open source and collaboration

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,599
so in 2009

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,680
together with with mario we

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,000
founded the first asia organization

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,599
what do we want to achieve with force

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,479
asia

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,039
so so basically it is a network of

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
people

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,080
from everywhere even though we call

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
ourselves asia

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,599
we're not limited to people inside asia

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,680
the whole idea is to connect people from

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,560
the west and everywhere to learn from

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,919
each other

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,639
to exchange ideas and work together

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,080
on solutions that can help to fix our

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,199
problems and also the world problems

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,000
as i mentioned earlier so people in in

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
our country

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
facing climate change and and many other

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
issues

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
we believe that um open open tax

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
solution

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,800
can could be a way for us

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
to to address the challenges

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,800
and also for me um open source when you

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
talk about technology there are also

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,440
different

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,639
opinion about how the impact of

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
technologies in

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,520
in in the modern day but for me open

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,280
source is not only about the software

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,240
it is the model of collaboration how

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,479
people work

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
how people connected from everywhere and

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,280
how

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
guan can devote their resources and

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
effort

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
to one project and this project being

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,519
shared with a wider community so that

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,159
everyone

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:43,599
can benefit from it and

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,560
we are very lucky that we um of course

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,320
able to to sustain the first asia

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,600
organization until today

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,959
after many years we continue to

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,480
develop our projects and enroll

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
every year i can share a little bit

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
about

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,800
some of our activities so at the fourth

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,560
asia

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
organization we focus on uh three main

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
areas

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,640
first of all um software and hardware

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,440
development so unlike many

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,959
um audio of open source organizations

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,839
out there we

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,920
we develop our own projects

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,600
um some of the projects um

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,080
can be found uh here here

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,240
um this is just a few of them um ccid

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:41,120
open source um void voice framework

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,279
loglock is a social media search engine

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,560
femi is the platform where you can share

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,680
your

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,600
media on multiple platforms

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,760
bslab.io is the a pocket sign lab

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
project but i can go a little bit in

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
detail later

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
we have event year event management

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
system

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,079
uh suspects in a source engine that

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,800
abuse beyond the peer-to-peer

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,519
search engine originated from jesse.net

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,880
and we have our own uh strong helper

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,760
which have

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,120
developers to keep track of their daily

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,160
contribution

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,360
and we have also an open source game

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,120
and many more that being developed from

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
the interests of our community

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,640
so people like the normal open source

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
working model people contribute to

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,600
to project online but they also want to

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,519
to have a platform where they can meet

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,800
and exchange in person

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,959
so we organize events and meetups

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,000
throughout the year one of our

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,720
biggest events is the first asia summit

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
that happen

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,880
every year in singapore and it will

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,440
take place again next year

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,360
in march in singapore so you can see

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,440
here a list of events that we

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,320
organize we do open day summit in sri

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,200
lanka

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,640
in myanmar india where we have

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,160
our most contributors um

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,240
in japan in hokkien city and

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,839
and and many more

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,120
um next to the events and

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,959
meetups we run our own uh coding and

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
education program

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,000
one of the program that that we've been

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,360
trending for the past four years

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,720
is cold heat so um

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,720
cortisol basically

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,279
is the concept that that guy young

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,920
developer how to contribute to various

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,160
asia projects it's a little similar a

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
little bit similar to

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
hacktoberfest where people can go

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
directly

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,399
into um the projects of

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,639
asia on on github and

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,560
find out tickers quit label got hit and

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
they can go through the ticket and solve

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
issue

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,000
the good thing about this contest is

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,360
the young contributor can have

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,639
a direct contact with a

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,399
more senior developer based on real life

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
issue of the project so they work

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,160
directly

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,519
on project they

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,040
get feedback from a mentor

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,920
on issue and make pull requests

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
the people get the highest number of

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
requests every

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,880
two months will get a price

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,480
from us and also a certificate for their

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,600
participation

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,480
most of the communication on our channel

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,240
and the community

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,240
happen on on guitar

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,600
this development platform is

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
can reference directly to github issues

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,320
it's really useful

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,920
when you want to discuss technical

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:22,079
topics or um

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,200
or development so one of our

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:29,040
practice in the first asia organization

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,560
is we encourage contributors and also

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,320
newcomers

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,000
to join the project chat

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,399
of their interest so we have event um

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,839
chat we have ccaitea so it depends on

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,560
the interest they can

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,000
go directly to the project chat and we

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,600
encourage everyone

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,040
to publicly um talk to to the roof when

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,639
they want to discuss

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,399
um or find out information instead of

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:02,399
paying people individual individually

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,959
so to our sda to try to keep everything

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
all the conversation communication more

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,040
transparent

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,040
and easier for everyone to follow up

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,360
yeah so the code here it started or

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,800
this year only started about a month ago

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
and we get a lot of

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,959
uh interest from from the community

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,000
i think we have uh over 600 audi

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,800
participants

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,880
for this um season and the number

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,639
continue to grow

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,440
every day yeah

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,760
um so some of the project that we do so

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
i want to just take opportunity

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,680
to disability to die a little bit deeper

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
into

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,120
some of the projects because i believe

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,720
that

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,440
um in this

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,880
critical time and not only for asia but

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,639
many organizations

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,720
try to do their best to to contribute

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:13,360
to the excuse

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:27,839
excuse me i've been 16 the last week

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:27,839
yeah so um

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,759
sorry about that

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,839
so um

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
so i just want to quickly highlight some

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
of

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,880
the project the projects that we've been

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,320
working on

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,240
so um first of all um in term of uh

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,880
event organization because the first

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,160
asia has been organized events um

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,560
for many years we

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,120
been always struggling to find one

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,920
solution one open source solution

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
that can help us to manage the entire

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,040
event

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
phone call for for for speaker to firm

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,600
to ticketing

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,600
and to scheduling so before we used to

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
have one system for call for schedule

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
one system

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
for um for ticketing and another

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,360
solution for

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,720
for scheduling and as an event organizer

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
also

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,880
we have learned a lot from the past few

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,360
years and

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,360
develop our own solution

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,760
let me see if i can

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
share this

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,839
necessary selling screen

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,000
so as you can see here

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
if you can see my screen so i just

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,840
show you one example that we um

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,320
of an event that's run on event year

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,679
system so with event yay

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,799
um you have the call for speaker

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
embedded in in the system uh where you

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,760
can customize um

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,640
uh how you uh what a date that you want

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,799
to collect

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
from the speakers or from uh the

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
submission

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
and then there is a feature where you

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
can

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,799
allow invite different reviewers to come

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,080
and collaborate

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,520
on the selection of of the topics

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,880
and then it also allows you to

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,919
automatically send out notification

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,559
to the submitters and after uh

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
lay the call for for speakers is with us

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,760
you also have

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,600
a chance to um to make the schedule

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,640
like to you the system to um to release

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,200
a program for your own event and because

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
of the

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,960
um pandemic a lot of events happen

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,960
online so we

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,919
have integrated many like online

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,120
features into event yeah for instance

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,840
you can see

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:53,520
uh the um the schedule based on your

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,799
local timeline or you can add an video

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,520
um a video uh platform into the event

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,360
so we also have give the the organizer

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
the option to integrate with

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,000
um open source video solution

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,559
electricity or big blue button

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,559
and here um so instead of hosting

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,520
something on your own

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
to to lower the barrier especially for

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
smaller community

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,919
who do not have the resources to host

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,520
their own

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,200
system or event so we offer like hosting

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,559
services for them as well

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,520
and they can have their event

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
run on event yay and they're also a way

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,240
that help

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,440
the organizer to um to feature like

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,799
the speakers and include a code of

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
conduct and so on

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,400
so the whole idea of this uh system is

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,320
to enable community organizer

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,640
from from everywhere not only a big uh

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,679
big events with a huge fundings but also

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,160
small and medium

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,520
event where they cannot uh afford to

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,320
have the return

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
to to pay for a professional a

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,559
professional

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,600
agency they can manage um the event

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,600
themselves and

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
and everything already included in the

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,480
system

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,520
um this is um

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,159
just to go into the detail how it looked

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,280
like

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
the interface of the organizer and so

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,520
i'm also very glad because

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,280
since the past few months our team been

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,240
working really hard on this

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,600
that's um to enable uh people to do like

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,840
online event

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,000
so i can quickly show you this um

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
so for instance this is the event that i

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,200
organized on behalf of

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,280
the open source initiative last month

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,679
and here you can see the option where

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,559
you can include

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,559
the online link for your event

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,600
and there's also attendees form where

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,640
you can collect

00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:03,840
the data whatever you um

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:03,840
you need for for the conference

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,559
yeah and uh for the scheduling so i

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,600
mentioned earlier that there is

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,280
the scheduling um feature

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,360
in place where you can just drag and

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,480
drop the submission

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,159
and schedule based on different room

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,120
and um and tracks yeah

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,080
and we also have a ticketing uh system

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,400
that allows you to

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,400
offer tickets to your attendees

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,559
the main page here is um on

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,679
eventday.com and the code can be filed

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
on github

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,640
as i mentioned earlier there is a

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,080
channel um

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,880
on github in case you have any

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,159
issue or a problem with the event you

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,120
can go there and communicate

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
directly with the developers in the past

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,679
a

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,120
few more few months we also worked

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,799
really hard on the

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,679
documentation uh for event day

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,000
there is a usual documentation on

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,280
support or event dh.com

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,320
where you can't go into and find article

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,600
how to um to create event and

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,400
and many more yeah so again the project

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,320
is available

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,320
on on github we are looking for

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,720
a supporter and user who want to try it

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:41,840
out

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:41,840
and contribute to our documentation

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,120
so back to the project list of force

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,440
asia so basically

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
event years in the solution that have

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
organized

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,720
in the conference time another project

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,679
that i want to introduce

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
is a pocket sign lab so pocket science

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,000
lab

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,440
is an example how to turn

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,760
a communicative project into a consumer

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:15,039
product why is it so important that

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,840
you have a business

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,600
model behind an open source project as

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
you know

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,320
if you run an open source project

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,400
resources is always a big

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,480
question for us all so the

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,200
sustainability of open source

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,760
project require the time of developer

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
required

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,919
resources that the project can raise and

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,360
therefore so we want to to show that

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,279
there is a possibility

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,559
to turn community project into a

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,520
consumer product

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,360
and can help to raise funding to put

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,400
back to the

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,000
development and pocket science is

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,120
an example of it so basically um

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,520
pocket style lab is a

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,120
usb power attention that you can connect

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,720
to your

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,760
android phone um or the pc and it's had

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
and it's com

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,799
with um a handful of functionalities

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
including

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,720
oscilloscope multimeter logic analyzer

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,640
weight generator and a lot more that is

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,240
possible to extend

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,279
the entire hardware is open source

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,559
and you can also find the

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,760
material everything available online

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,320
i just want to share a little bit why we

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,520
we started to work on hardware projects

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
um

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
as you know that hardware is always

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,880
required more effort

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,640
and it also require more um

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,679
funding and the way how do you

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,880
produce it also a really tricky uh

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,640
question right it started actually

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,240
uh back in i believe 2014

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,159
and when we run the first asia summit in

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,679
cambodia

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:13,919
at that time one of our speakers

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,679
was a physics teacher from a small town

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,600
in india

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,279
he came to us he gave a talk about

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,559
python and how he

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,679
he taught python in school he came to us

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,480
with a problem saying that it's quite

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
challenging

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
to teach electronics to students these

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
days because

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,320
in india pm the students do not have

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,400
access to

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,679
the devices and only only learning from

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,360
from book is really difficult for them

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,000
to um to think and to imagine what it

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,799
actually

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,320
happened in in the reality and also it

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,919
difficult to motivate

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,640
to motivate a student to learn

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,480
electronics and he asked us is there any

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,520
open source solution out there

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,200
that can be used for education that can

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,480
help the teacher

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,120
to uh to teach a student

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:12,000
easier yeah and he also recommended some

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,440
some projects that he found um in the

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,400
community and based

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,520
on uh the the suggestion the first asia

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,919
community

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,760
um like look into this and develop

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
the project further so we make a

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,919
commitment to

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,520
to him and also to the teachers uh the

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,080
the school network that we connected

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,120
with

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
that we would develop uh something uh

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,440
completely

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
uh open source and that enable people to

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,679
learn and also to

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
do to make it as an example encourage

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,520
more

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,520
people to to build and um and

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
and release their hardware open source

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,320
as well

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
so pakistan laughs

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
is now being distributed in many uh

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,440
platform

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,520
um on our own website of course video we

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,760
you can also find it on

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,240
other electronic shop in asia and even

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,360
um

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,039
in the u.s yeah so if you want to get a

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
hole with the device and want to play

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
with us

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,159
you can also um find a link on the

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,039
website where to get it

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,039
um the last year we partnered up with

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,480
the openness

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,240
project in in europe so basically

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,679
um again it's got to to link with

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:35,279
the current situation as you know the

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,120
corona pandemic has slowed down many

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,559
um business and also distribution around

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,520
the world especially when it comes to

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,480
production facilities in in china so

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,039
before

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,039
our product was being produced with

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,840
partner in china but again

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,440
um the situation is so unstable the

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,880
whole idea with

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,120
the open neck the project that we

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,840
involve is to try to find a way

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,039
how to produce hardware locally so we

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,200
work together with

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:10,480
um make a maker lab and

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,520
makerspace and fab lab

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
around the area where you're living in

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
and

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,559
and try to understand their producing

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,279
capability

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,880
of course they cannot um produce like

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,480
the big quality

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,279
as manufacturer in china but we try to

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,960
experiment

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,840
whether multiple and small um

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
production site can help and also

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,640
produce

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,559
like the prototypes and the product

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,600
locally um

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,159
so this is being like pilot at the

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,320
moment

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,200
and we we hope that to release the

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,640
outcome

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,640
um in the next year

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,279
another um project that i want to

00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,559
to introduce is susie dot ai

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,760
um susi dot ai is the void

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,279
um a voice framework yeah so

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,039
uh of course they're um on many

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,640
um industrial solutions out there like

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,640
a google home alexa

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
from from amazon and many like

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,559
commercial products

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,240
but um the susie ai is the idea that to

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,240
show

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,320
the community that there is a

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,760
possibility to develop

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,240
um a voice framework

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,360
um with open source technology and

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,080
solution

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,279
so that the web the future of the west

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
will not depends on

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,960
only corporate and big company but we

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,279
can also contribute

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,559
into this so um so uh from cci

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,679
the latest development of sushi ida was

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,240
we was able to integrate deep speech

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,000
the supposed to stack framework of

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,440
mozilla into

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,320
our project and we have a very simple

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,799
installer for you to try for you to try

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
out

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,840
so the project website on susie.ai

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,240
and the code i would highly recommend to

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,640
to check out the suse installer

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,760
um that was the project uh

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,279
developed by michael christian one of

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,720
our senior developers

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:34,960
many years ago right now we

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,159
we partner up so the use case of ccai

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,200
we recently partnered up with the unesco

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,320
in um in in bangkok

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,600
that developed an initiative for tech

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,320
and culture

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:53,760
um so right now many um

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,679
culture uh institution

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,360
uh museum uh earth center are being

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,000
closed due to the covet

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,919
and it's um make it very challenging for

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,640
culture practitioner and community

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,279
to connect and to and to get themselves

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,279
and to

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:19,919
to get themselves

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:22,799
being educated and

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,080
and work into this country field and the

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,519
whole idea of this

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,360
tech and cow initiative is how we can

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,799
enable people to continue their practice

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,360
continue to share

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,440
and spread the knowledge about culture

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,320
and our

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,279
sector so we should see one of the use

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,720
cases that

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,360
we've been discussing with other

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,720
science center and museum in asia that

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,960
can help them to set up

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,080
a virtual accident a system where

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,120
the existing database and knowledge form

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,399
from the center can be

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,519
a knowledge base for um for this voice

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:09,840
assistant and it's become um a guided

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,840
uh virtual personnel for people who want

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,559
to visit and we also want to enhance the

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,760
virtual experience for

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,559
for the attendees um in a few weeks

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,720
the tech and culture initiative will be

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,760
launched

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,840
and we will share more with you in the

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,840
upcoming days

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,559
so this is um some of the projects of

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,320
foss asia i want also

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:48,000
to share a little bit of the um

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,679
the lesson that we learned um

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,159
from the past few years how we can

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,440
become a sustainable organization and be

00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,080
able to scale up

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
first of all right and top on the list

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,519
so we want to attract

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
a contributor and developer so we

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,840
develop

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,480
something called the development best

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,519
practices

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,120
that is a starting point for

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,279
for developer we also a very um

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,559
friendly and open community where

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,320
everyone is welcome

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,000
not only asian as mentioned in the

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,000
beginning many of our

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,039
mentors and contributors are coming from

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,399
europe and other parts of the world

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,799
we continuously attract a new talents

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,640
through coding programs and events so

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,760
the situation had changed a lot

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,159
um like over the years uh

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,880
before when open source started a few

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,600
people

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,519
get together and then they join up with

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
the people from the community where they

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,159
share

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,559
the same interests but as you know um

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,640
in asia it's another story as people

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,679
like struggling every day

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,960
um taking care of their family and also

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,240
they need to find a way

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:12,000
to sustain their own life so um

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:15,280
the um the hope of having continuous uh

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,079
contribution from people um

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,000
is it's not like uh really big anymore

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,560
it's not played like this anymore

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,280
so in order to to continue attract new

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,000
people

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,240
we organize coding programs uh through

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,520
the copying programs with contribution

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,359
but at the same time

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,079
we provide a training platform that can

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,000
help people

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:41,280
to learn a new skill and therefore

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
support their like future career

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,960
development

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,040
a lot of people graduated from the first

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,159
asia program and have a very

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,919
good job elsewhere of course we want

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,480
them to continue to stay on board with

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,200
us but we also cannot like stop people

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,839
to find a way to suspend their own life

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,960
yeah

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,640
and continuously working with with new

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,200
people

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,000
train more uh young developers we also

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,920
work together

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,160
with universities and and school

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,359
around asia and i think it's really

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,359
important that um

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
different uh user group and different

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,400
actors in the ecosystem get connected

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,079
they're always a notation that oh you

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,359
also have like open source community

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,520
people also do something and they're

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,560
always a competition mindset

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,720
but we don't want to

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,800
to follow this path we want to work with

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,440
with people so we connected with a lot

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,599
of

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,599
um open source user group and

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,119
organization around asia

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,800
um to set the resources and foster

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,520
the open collaboration another thing

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,280
that we find very useful to engage

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,640
people always to

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
um give them more responsibilities so

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,960
after

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,960
um you spend

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
an amount of time with the organization

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,599
right and you're also

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,440
being promoted to become a mentor or

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,640
senior developers and

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
and you also get a chance to to train uh

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
to train

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,359
and provide guidance to younger

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
developer or newcomer and i realized

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,760
that

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:26,640
people are really motivated by

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,760
sharing their knowledge and being um uh

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,640
respected and listening to by

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,520
other people so that was a very good um

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,040
approach

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:40,240
um we also uh support like people to

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,680
to send our appreciation

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,720
uh swag before uh when the

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,280
the situation was normal we also

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,119
fly people into our conference but of

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
course it's not okay anymore hiring

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,960
opportunities of course

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,280
um we're hiring we're consistently

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,560
hiring developers to

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,359
work on some of our projects and we

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,400
always give these priorities to our

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,400
long-term contributors

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,839
drawing different income stream to pay

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,800
for that um

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,280
i understand that um in the u.s there's

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,880
many

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,040
um like non-profits and organizations

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
being supported by big company

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,359
but the situation is a little bit is

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,160
very different in asia

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,119
we don't get the same level of support

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
like people

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,160
from the west also setting up a

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,359
non-profit is super

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,640
difficult and therefore we constantly

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,440
need to think of

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,200
an income stream a model how we can pay

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,920
for our development

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,119
and um so i wouldn't say that we are so

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
successful but

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,560
but i think that we are doing pretty

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
well with the um

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
the result the little resources that we

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,599
have we'll be able

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,640
to to sustain and and get funding to

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,359
continue to grow

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,280
our projects running a lean organization

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,200
and infrastructure in the beginning we

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,000
spend a lot of time on setting up the

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,040
infrastructure

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,320
but later on we we move all

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:14,240
our coding projects into a github

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,280
of course you need to see like

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,200
where to where

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
where you can attract the most

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
developers so that was our decision to

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,880
not

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,760
sell the infrastructure anymore but

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
but run on a third party service it also

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,480
released some of the

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,359
burden from our maintainers and focus

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,880
more on

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,880
on building features uh pandering with

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,280
enterprises and and projects so

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,960
we work we open to work together with

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
with companies

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
and projects who want to who share the

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,560
same

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,640
passion with us to to grow open source

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,839
ecosystem and also to build

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,200
sustainable solution

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,760
yeah and um to find

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,880
out more about what we are doing you can

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,000
visit please visit

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,880
um forceasia.org um

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,240
we also have um like different way where

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,079
you can support

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,960
um the organization so we have the

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,040
membership so which is only like really

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,160
simple if you want to to contribute so

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
the funding of

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,119
um coming from the community we entirely

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,839
put into the development of false asia

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,240
project
