Abstract: Sustainability is always a big question for many open source projects. Limited resources, undefined culture, lack of a common goals or visions, lack of maintainers, no backup, poor documentation, politics, internal conflicts, external attackers or trolls, and unwillingness to collaborate with enterprises are challenges that prevent open source projects to grow. Hong Phuc Dang shares the story of FOSSASIA; the lessons she learned on how to engage contributors from Asia; how to sustain and scale open source projects with limited resources; and ideas to monetize an open source project in order to grow based on a real example of PSLab.
