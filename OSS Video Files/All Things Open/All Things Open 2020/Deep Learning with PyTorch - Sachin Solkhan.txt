Abstract: PyTorch is a open source, Python based machine and deep learning framework. It's easy-to-use API has made it a popular tool for building deep learning models. In this session, we will briefly learn basics of deep learning and focus on building a neural network using PyTorch. We will work through a Jupyter notebook to learn the steps to define, train and evaluate a convolutional neural network in PyTorch. Using a pre-trained neural network, we will then build a image classifier.
