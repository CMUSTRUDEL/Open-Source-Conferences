Abstract: This event is just like an in-person job fair, but online! We will have our own virtual “booth” (Zoom room) that you can join from the comforts of your home. Use this time to learn more about mission and purpose, company culture, open positions, and what it's like working for Sonatype. We will have various speakers sharing about our company as well as a Q&A session.
