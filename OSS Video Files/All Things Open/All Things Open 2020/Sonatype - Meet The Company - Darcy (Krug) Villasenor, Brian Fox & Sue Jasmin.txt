folks here on the line today

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
hiring is definitely an important part

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,400
of our organization and something

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880

jump in and join today's session to

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,399
share a little bit more about stenotype

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,680
why the work that we do here is so

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
interesting

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
and share with you a little bit about

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
some of the positions that we're hiring

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,840
for right now

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
and some of the tools and technology and

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
the culture that we have here

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,680
so i'm going to help try and moderate

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
the session if you will

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
i do believe it's being recorded so we

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,559
can share out afterwards

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,840
to the attendees maybe to kick

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
things off i would like to see if brian

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
fox if you'd like to give an

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,239
introduction of yourself and maybe

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,720
share with the folks on the line a

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,040
little bit about the company

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,040
sure thanks darcy uh my name is brian

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
fox i'm one of the co-founders and cto

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
here

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
you know my background is in software

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
development and open source i was active

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
on the apache maven project

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
and was a pmc chair for many years uh

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,759
when we founded the company back in 2007

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
we

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,080
were focused a lot on the maven

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,240
ecosystem uh helping companies

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,079
modernize their build infrastructure

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,720
moving from things like ant and make

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,320
files and and those types of things and

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
early on we saw companies struggling

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,920
with how do they manage

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,960
those dependencies and and

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,439
we saw many horrifying practices

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
frankly that really uh ran counter to

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,479
what development needed

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,799
to be able to produce high quality

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
software and and over the years we kind

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
of moved into an area

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
to understand that that that was a

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
problem that

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
really needed to be solved and have

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,479
spent you know

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,880
probably half the time since 2007

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
uh working in that direction so trying

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
to provide

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
tooling and data to help developers

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
choose better open source components and

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
be aware

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,720
of the security and legal and quality

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
ramifications so that's that's kind of

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
the

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,319
high level overview where we came from

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
and and what we're working on

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,840
awesome thank you brian um

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
next up i was gonna see if mike if you

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
wanted to jump in and share a little bit

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,800
about

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
some of the work that we're doing around

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
innovation and the new products that we

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,879
are going to be launching

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,720
sure thing uh i may call a little bit of

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,400
an audible there brian's entirely too

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
humble

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
i met brian about nine years ago and

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
already sona type had

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
started changing the way the world

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,000
developed software frankly it was really

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
impressive with maven

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
and it was really early and we had the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
repository manager binary repository

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
manager

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,319
um and that was starting to to

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
uh get a lot of traction as well but

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,440
that also changed the way the world

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
developed software and so

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
if you're interested in helping shape

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,480
the way the world develops software

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,040
um our third uh attempt at this um

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,200
is uh the life cycle product um which i

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,400
guess does speak to your question around

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,720
uh innovation darcy so you know we're

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
so much the world uses so much open

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,280
source now being able to provide people

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
with

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
information that they didn't otherwise

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
have i mean the way that people select

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
the software

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,319
the open source they use now generally a

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,680
google search or talking to somebody

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,080
and i think we're just starting to chip

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
away

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
at what people really need we started

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,920
with security and legal related

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,519
stuff but there's a whole a whole lot

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
more there around quality and

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,439
capability um that we're starting to uh

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
uncover at this point

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,519
so really looking forward to where we're

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
gonna be in the years ahead

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
around that

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,439
awesome thanks mike um i know we've got

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
a lot of interesting work that's going

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,519
on and creating

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,519
even more exciting tools and technology

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,440
for other developers to use and so

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
sonotypes mission is really about being

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
developer first

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
and focus and everything that we do and

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
the way that we make decisions and the

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
products that we launch

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
so i think that core value that we have

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
has been an awesome

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
attribute and why we're able to attract

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
other great talent here

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
at sonotype um sue

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
maybe you could introduce yourself in

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
the role that you have here i think

history of the company

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,520
that gets individuals comfortable before

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,280
day one

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,039
with the company the product group and

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,360

remote culture with over 300 employees

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,759
one of the ways we get to know each

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,320
other is through our over

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
100 sig or special interest group

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
channels in slack

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,759
we've had an active women at sonotype

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
group for several years now which has

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,680
helped kicked off our

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
diversity inclusion conversation we're

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,319
never short on pet pictures

sharing parenting tips for homeschooling

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,720
supporting each other in feats of

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
athletic endurance like finishing a deca

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
triathlon in the uk

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
or completing a diy deck project in

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
alaska

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
if you can't find something among these

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
channels to pique your interest we'll

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
meet you in the lounge where you can

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,000
share what's on your mind 24 7.

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
uh one of our support team members

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
proved this perfectly this morning by

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
being the first comment in the lounge

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
tagging an article and sharing that he

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
wanted to learn more about gravity

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
when it comes to innovation we've been

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,759
recognized two years in a row by fast

company magazine

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,680

projects beyond our day-to-day work as

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,360
part of our bi-weekly improvement days

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,840
and bi-annual innovation weeks

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
these no meeting days with demos give

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
people a chance to work independently or

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
collaborate across the company to find

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
new ways to deliver value to our

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
customers

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,440
but being an open source and community

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,280

on on improvement day we have no

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,080
meetings scheduled for that day

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
so that people can focus on on what

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
they'd like to work on

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,800
that's pretty awesome i don't know of

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,400
any other company that really does

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,479
anything like that

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,759
and it's every two weeks uh for two

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,240
quarters so it's

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
considerable dedication to that yeah and

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
do you guys during those innovation days

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
do you just focus

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,720
on tech products are they

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,960
or is it innovation across the entire

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
company like how does that work

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
it could be some it could be a tech

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
product for our customers or for the

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
company

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
and it can even be self-improvement um

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,039
if you wanted to take an online class

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
and improve your skills or

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
read a book the only thing we ask is

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,879
that there's some sort of outcome or

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
artifact from that that

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
is shareable so that other people can

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,240
see what's going on

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,599
and can possibly you know learn

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
something new from you

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
i mean the genesis that was everything

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
was being driven from the product

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,599
management side early on

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
and i think it was maybe six six years

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
ago

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
um we said what if we carved out a

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
portion of time

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,599
and let um the individual contributors

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
determine what was important

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
and so that's exactly what we did and

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,240
we've been doing it for six years

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,279
with very good uh effect

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
yeah i like that sort of bottom-up and

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,720
top-down approach

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
where you know it's pretty much a flat

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,680
organization if you've got ideas you've

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,760
got a

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
problem that you see that we can solve

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
it's really nice to know that

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
you know your voice is heard and you see

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
an opportunity and you can create a

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
solution

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
doesn't matter if you're an entry-level

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
uh

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,440
intern with the company or if you're

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,800
part of senior leadership

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,040
yeah into that flat organization notion

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
the idea is if you can reach across the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
entire company

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,040
and engage with somebody on that day and

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
spend time with them

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
you don't have to just be within your

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
team

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,279
yeah i had somebody who joined recently

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,800
that said oh i have to reach out to

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,959
the head of engineering and introduce

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
myself i'm really nervous is that

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,160
allowed

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
i said yeah absolutely it's every door

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,839
is open

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,680
around here it's a unique culture in

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,000
that

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
and speaking of culture staying

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
connected

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,120
you can have all the communication tools

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,600
in the world but they're useless

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
unless people use them so above all else

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
at sonotype we pride ourselves on being

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,920
transparent

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,399
empathetic smart and and always learning

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
team culture that welcomes new teammates

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
with unlimited opportunities to

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,720
contribute from every perspective

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
pre-covid teams would get together to

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
kick off big projects

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
and there were regularly scheduled

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
company get-togethers

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,880
and we've even had sona type sponsored

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,040
dinners for people who live nearby each

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
other in different parts of the world

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
we still value that ability to connect

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
in person again when the time is right

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,640
in the meantime we're making remote work

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
for us quite successfully as we have for

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,959
the past 12 years

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,600
so we're good at this yeah that was

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,320
pretty nice once covid hit

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
everyone switched to this new working

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
from home

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
and our product organization has always

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
been 100

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
remote so we actually shared some best

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,680
practices

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
across the company for certain areas who

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
weren't already 100

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,720
remote which was really nice to be able

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,519
to leverage

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
um i also joined the introduction of the

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,320
new donut buddies

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
it's kind of exciting you get to get get

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
randomly selected once a month

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
to partner up with somebody from a

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
different part of the business

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,440
you get to choose how often you want to

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,399
meet what you want to talk about

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,240
maybe it's coffee maybe it's cocktails

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,160
after work you know you guys figure out

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,360
what works best for you but

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,279
it's a great way to learn about your

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
teammates outside of just the project

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
that you're working on and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,600

culture here at sonotype i know that's

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,959

joining um the team everyone has this

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,079

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,760
brief introduction of yourself

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
and share a little bit about your area

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,800
of the business

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,399
yeah sure i'm denison wright the vp of

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,320
engineering here at sonotype

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
i've been with the company just a little

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,079
bit under four years

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:13,120
and i live in the washington dc area

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,639
um so i guess you know a couple of

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
things come to mind it's great to hear

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
uh all of the folks that had a chance to

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
speak before i did here

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
uh sue talked about uh you know culture

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
one of the aspects about culture that i

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
think is really important

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
the the set of values that will kind of

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
influence how we behave in the

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
organization

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,040
um you know we spent some time crafting

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
and documenting uh you know more

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,800
explicitly

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
uh our values uh earlier this year and i

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,560
just wanted to kind of like you know

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
uh highlight a few of them here for the

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
group

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,959

we work in teams so obviously look for

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
people that like teamwork

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
um you know we're looking for for people

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,639
who are pragmatists

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,200
uh but also love their craft and are

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,800
always looking to improve upon that so

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,240
you know have a mindset of continuous

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,160
learning um

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,920
you know we want people who care who

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,560
take ownership of things

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,399
and and it's really amazing to see kind

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
of like all of the folks that i've had a

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
chance to work here over the past few

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
years you know how kind like a

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
combination of all of those things have

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,279
allowed people to really like

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,399
increase their uh you know scope of

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
responsibility

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
and impact in the organization as well

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
so kind of like people joining in

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
whatever role

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
designer and engineer product manager

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,160
and you know

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
over time you know creating you know

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,160
products or having very significant

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,959
contribution to things that get used by

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,839
potentially millions of people so that's

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,920
really interesting to see

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,680
um and and darcy i don't know if you

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,360
have already covered or will cover kind

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,839
of some of the roles that we're

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,639
looking to fill uh if not i can speak

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,639
about that a little bit as well

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,800
if you want to speak about it i can put

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
up a screen which has some information

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,920
related to that on there

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,320
um i think that would be good okay yeah

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
fantastic so some type uh you know i

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
think fortunately has kind of

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,279
experienced a lot of growth in the last

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,440
several years and continues to to do so

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,760
and as we continue to expand the team

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,839
you know we're looking to to complement

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
the existing team that we have to

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
support uh you know some existing

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
products and teams that we have as well

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
as spinning up new ones to support new

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
things that we want to bring to the

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,839
market

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
so you know like any typical product

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
organization

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,160
uh our teams are made up of

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,199
cross-functional

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,800
members and and those typically uh

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
involve product management you know

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
security researchers

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079

um you know just to name a few obviously

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
we have to have the the appropriate

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
support structure

uh all of these members although we we

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,519
really like to to be fairly hands-off uh

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,959
with our you know managerial approach

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
but we're also looking for engineering

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,880
managers

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,680
uh to to complement that um and i guess

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199

yeah hey i'm christine curtis um i run

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,480
the design studio here at sonotype

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,040
we currently have uh gosh

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,920
six product designers and a couple of

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,639
engineers

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,880
and a content creator and we are hiring

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,959
next year um

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,400
pretty aggressively we are looking for

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,039
you know more product designers both

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
junior and

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,079
senior level um and we are looking for

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
some front-end engineers technology

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,360
specialists design technologists

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
it's got a lot of different names at a

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,720
lot of different companies but we're

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,880
definitely looking for some of those

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,360
engineers who like to get close with

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,839
design folks and build great uis

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,520
we have been elevating our customer

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
experience here at sonotype

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
exponentially over the last couple of

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,559
years and we're looking to continue that

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
great work

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,080
we're a diverse group over in the design

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,720
studio you know if you can if you can

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,240
think of an

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
underrepresented minority we probably

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
have one uh but we're also

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
super friendly like you know we talk

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
about the donut buddies and all that

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
stuff design studio does its own stuff

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
as well

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
we before covid had off sites just for

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
design studio folks

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,000
um and every wednesday we have brunch

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,600
which seems completely ridiculous

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
because none of us live even in the same

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
state some of us don't even live in the

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
same country

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
uh but every wednesday morning we just

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,520
open a zoom room and some people show up

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,120
and some people don't just depends on

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
what your calendar looks like and we

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,400
hang out and we eat and we chat

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,160
and come and go and it's it's a fun

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
low barrier way to kind of get to know

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,240
each other and really bond and those

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
bonds really do come through in our work

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,559
you know

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,400
i didn't know about your brunch meeting

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,520
christine i feel like i want to join you

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
guys now

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,320
i'll send you the invite everybody's

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,120
welcome awesome

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,799
um well thanks for sharing um last but

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,320
not least in the group we do

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,840
have um mike griffin so i'm just gonna

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
tee you up but we do have a couple of

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,039
quick questions that are coming through

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,280
on the chat so i may just throw out a

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,280
couple of those while we have them

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
um it says support engineers are listed

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
on our site though it says there's

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,120
travel 35

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
of the time and it's not remote is that

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,240
correct so i think rusty that question

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,080
is over to you

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,520
sure sure yeah i'd be happy to address

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,240
that um so

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,360
in this case you know our commitment to

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
customer success

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,039
uh from a company's standpoint is is

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,440
broad

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
every organization within sonotype is

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,919
responsible for

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,679
the successful deployment and use the

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,440
the particular position that you're

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
referring to the customer success

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
engineer

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,080
is in our customer success group and is

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,160
a very

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,679
complementary role but slightly

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,640
different role from product

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,559
support so a customer success engineer

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
is somebody that owns the relationship

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,679
with the customer

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
they are typically engaged after the

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,840
deal has been made and a customer is

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
officially part of our family now

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,440
uh and they work with that customer on a

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
regular basis to ensure

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,880
that hey they're successful with the use

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,360
of the product that we

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
are aware of their planned use both

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
current and future

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,080
of the product so that we can make sure

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,320
we're in alignment

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,520
and help them make sure they're using

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,039
the right products

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
the right solutions and using them in

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,880
the right way that role does travel some

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,720
at least it did

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
traditionally right now there's not a

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
whole lot of travel going on as everyone

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,039
knows

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,520
but that role would travel some you

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,120
would go to some on sites with customers

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,559
and meet with the customers

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
uh it's slightly different than the

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,720
product support role where we have the

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,320
same goal to make customers successful

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,080
although it's much more traditional in

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,640
the product support in that

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,159
we typically are more reactive and are

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,760
responding to

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,840
uh inquiries that are coming in through

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
our support channels

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,039
so the at the moment i don't believe

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,520
there's any

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,919
product support roles being advertised

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,840
on the site like i said those are coming

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,440
there will be multiple ones of those in

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,200
multiple regions

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,640
and if that is your interest though i

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
would encourage you to still reach out

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,919
to us

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
and raise your hand early as we will be

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,320
looking uh

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
for very very uh we're going to be

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
looking pretty hard for people on that

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
uh it's a very difficult role in our

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
organization

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,640
but it's one that i think people can

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,520
rise to the challenge and we have the

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,480
tools

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,159
and the training to support that person

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
i'll take a minute to just explain that

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
if you are

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,039
thinking about that support role that

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,200
product support role it's ideal for

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,200
somebody that loves a challenge

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
likes working on many different

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
technologies

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,840
likes problem solving of course and has

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,760
a strong sense of customer empathy

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,120
the staff that i have is very tenured

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,440
in fact several the people have been

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,880
with me for many many years

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,799
and we take a lot of pride in the work

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
that we do and in making customers

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,520
successful

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,960
so that's a high level difference

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,600
between the customer

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
success engineer and the product support

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
engineer

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,880
like i said we work together all the

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,640
time most of my staff knows the cses by

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,400
name and vice versa

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
we enjoy working with them and again the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
end goal is just to make sure that

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
our customers are successful with the

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
solutions they've deployed

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,679
awesome thank you so much for sharing

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
that feedback rusty i think that's

00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
helpful for

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
the folks that are on the line here

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
today and to that extent i

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,679
mentioned at the beginning we are going

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,240
to be sending out

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,080
this presentation afterwards but in

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,760
addition to the full recording we're

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,480
also going to include

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,400

able to keep your eye out on positions

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,159
that we have coming up

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
if you have a particular position that

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,840
you're interested in that maybe you just

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,039
don't see it yet and we commented on it

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
here today

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,400
we'll give you a few contact names and

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,960
email addresses so you'll be able to

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,799
follow up with folks directly

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,480
like i said we are continuing to grow

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,799
quite significantly

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,080
um over the next year we're right now

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,200
we're about 350 360

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,280
people globally we're going to hire

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
another 60-plus people within the next

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
three months so

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,720
we are continuing to rapidly grow um a

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
lot of positions like i said are

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
continuing to come online

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,360
as we're chatting um if you guys have

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,280
other questions feel free to drop them

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,799
in the chat channel we'll be happy to

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,960
answer them as we

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,960
continue on the discussion here i think

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,799
we have about until 3 45

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,120
eastern time for the total session so we

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,400
have about another 20 minutes or so

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,679
if there are additional questions um

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,360
darcy i think you might have just

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,080
answered it but there was a question

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
about

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,960
in the next six months how many

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
engineers do we expect to hire and is

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
there a head count

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,360
that we're targeting and scaling to i

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,200
believe he just answered that but

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
i want to make sure that uh it was in

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
the phrase of about the six month time

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
frame

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
yeah so over the next six months i don't

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
have that number

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,559
off the top of my head i have until

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
about december

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,919
dennis and mike do you guys have the

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
number for the next six months

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,080
um i don't have the exact number but i

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
don't know that that's uh

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,880
critically important i think that the

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,279
the key factor here is that we're

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
working to scale as fast as we can

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,799
effectively

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,240
scale you know finding the right people

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,000
along the way but as

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,480
darcy as you already mentioned to give

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,480
you a sense of the magnitude of hiring

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
in the next two and a half months we're

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,279
hiring 60 people

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,720
it's not just in the product

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,760
organization that's across the whole

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,279
company but

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,400
uh there's a lot of uh positions that

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,159
we're going to be filling

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,720
certainly in the next six months

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,720
absolutely

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
um so mike griffin we've got you on the

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
line

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
here um do you want to introduce

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,960
yourself and share a little bit about

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
what you do here at sonotype since you

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,480
are a part of this awesome product

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,300
leadership team that we have

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,440
it sure sells it all

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,640
[Laughter]

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,880
living and breathing it like everyone

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,200
else here does in their discipline so

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,640
uh yeah i think so mike griffin i lead

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
the information security team here at

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,000
sonotype

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
i've been on board for less than a year

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
i think i'm right at 10 months or

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,880
something like that now

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,640
um certainly loving working with this

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,640
team

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
in kind of building out and and

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,440
continuing to build out the security

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
program here everything from people

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,640
process technology and oversight so

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,480
uh mostly i've been handling uh the team

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,679
handles mostly in the space of policies

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
and things like that that most people

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,520
don't necessarily care for it's the

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
you know the dry portion of the security

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
thing but however we are definitely

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
moving into the people area where we're

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,679
training folks getting to ramp up our

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,159
security awareness training

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,679
so we handle that area of security and

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,600
then i think the the part that's

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,600
probably most important to the folks

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
here is the technical aspects right as

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
we start to fill out this team and try

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,640
to keep pace with the growth of this

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,440
organization and the expansion that

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
these teams

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,960
teams here have is being able to keep up

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,760
with and make sure that we're

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,440
not only um you know testing it as as

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,960
normally you would as a packaged product

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,240
but really getting farther and farther

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
left within the stack

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,760
uh from from helping the folks and

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,760
understanding what we're planning to

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,720
design what we're planning to build

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
and make sure that we have security

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
requirements at the very beginning again

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
it's the the whole

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,440
you know bake it in not sprayed on type

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,120
of security so as we get

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,440
get farther and farther down uh to the

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
left of this we're looking to hire folks

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
that

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,080
that know code that can break code that

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,440
can help us build out uh even

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,200
even better than we already have our

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,039
secure development processes

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,559
and test it along the way but most

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,760
importantly keep it as efficient as

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
possible so

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,360
as developers you don't have to worry

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
about you know these stop gates these

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
speed bumps

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,039
those sorts of things there's less

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,159
gating and more it just happens as a

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,600
process of work so

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
we're looking to try to you know bring

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,640
on folks that really understand and are

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
really passionate about

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
you know building and breaking uh and

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
testing and securing you know

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,200
applications code everything from

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,640
the beginning all the way to the end so

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,919
once we've shipped a product

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,080
uh to be able to make sure that we

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
continuously test it so we're definitely

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
looking for

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,600
you know a couple different folks in the

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,840
in that area and we'll be getting those

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,840
posted as soon as possible

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,760
thank you mike appreciate all that great

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,320
info

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,760
security gotta love the t-shirt everyone

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
else i think we have our center type

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,799
swag on

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,080
um which is another thing that most

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,320
employees will get

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,880
after they join the company too um

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
so a couple of uh things that i wanted

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
to share so i'm gonna go ahead

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and put my screen up here please let me

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,840
know when you guys are able to see it

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
can you guys see my screen

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,320
yes thank you um so this is highlighting

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,039
just a few of our

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,919
employer awards um for sonotape as i

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,240
mentioned

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,440
people are extremely important to our

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,679
organization

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,520
and the growth of our company and having

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
the right people on board

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,120
and i think that having won so many

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,399
awards

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,200
such as top career launching company

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,720
best paces to work top company for

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,720
innovators

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,120
um i think this shows and speaks to

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,240
our organization the innovation the

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,640
products

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,480
and the cool and exciting work that we

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
have and the great people that we have

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
on board

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
so a lot of these were based off of

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,960
surveys within our own company of

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,880
employees so it's not just an

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,799
external survey um we are continuing to

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,559
win other awards i think sue

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,880
highlighted one of our other most recent

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,919
awards which was the fast company

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,960
top places for innovators and we also um

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,080
just recently

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,080
won another top cyber company

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
from northern virginia technology

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
council

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,880
since we are based out of the washington

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
dc area we tend to win a lot of local

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,799
awards as well

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,559
um we're very proud of all of these

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,919
awards and accolades and look forward to

so um one of the things that i wanted to

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,520
do was a quick couple of questions

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,880
to the folks that we have on the line um

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,559

what the alpha cup

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,960
responses will be um but when you think

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
of sonotype what are the top three

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
things

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,159
that pop in your mind keep it simple i

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,159
don't want to limit it to one word but

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,679
if you have one word that's great

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,080
but when you think of sonotype what are

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,080
those three things that stand out to you

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,960
i can call on people but if you just

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,200
want to unmute and go for it that's fine

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,200
too

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,320
go ahead sue i can go after you yeah i

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,640
would just say

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,600
i'm there's there are no shortage of

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,480
smart

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,320
opinions that people contribute to the

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
conversation on a daily basis

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,360
and it can be about work and it can be

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,120
about things going on in the world but

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,919
um really some great abstract thinking

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,360
and

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,360
uh really great engagement

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,679
go ahead denison yeah thanks sue

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,600
um yeah the things that that popped in

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,159
my head i agree with sue definitely

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,279
smart

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,240
passionate people um hard problems

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,200
but a great organization great culture i

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,919
mean we always

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,960
you know work hard and and and obviously

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,600
smartly

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,000
but uh you know kind of just trying to

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
do

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,840
do the best to bring kind of like

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
invaluable things to the market and then

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,880
uh you know working with customers for

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,720
them to be successful

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,240
the kind of impact that we can have uh

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
all of those things i think uh

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
you know you can see that the passion

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,840
and everybody to to work on that mission

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,480
i think uh initiative comes to mind

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,399
and i think it stemmed from the early

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,799
days uh with the remote

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,440
uh work you know people coming in you

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,720
know it was

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,080
necessary as we were a small

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
organization for people to take

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,919
initiative and

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,799
and uh that has been you know uh

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,080
retained

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,159
throughout i think uh you know we've

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,559
strived hard to create an environment

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,399
that where people feel empowered you can

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
say well we empower people but

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,600
if you don't feel empowered it doesn't

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,799
really matter but the combination of

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,960
feeling and power

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,440
and uh making it clear that it's okay to

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,640
take risk and make mistakes

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,279
and then you have a bunch of people

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,799
around you that support you i think is

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,640
really led to a great working

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,679
environment for us overall and driven

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,679
a ton of innovation

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,159
yeah i agree i think uh what really

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,000
catches me about the folks here is

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,080
everyone is a lifelong learner

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,679
like everyone is interested in something

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
you know uh in something maybe they

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,039
weren't even interested in yesterday

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
to i think darcy's point earlier or

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,600
maybe it was sue

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,600
in the lounge this morning someone was

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,799
talking about gravity and astrophysics

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,240
and like 10 other people were like

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,960
that's awesome we never thought about

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
that

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,640
uh but that happens all the time and

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
sometimes it's really focused on a work

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,799
problem and sometimes it's so

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
random uh and we end up with sig

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,200
channels like electric cars

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
uh so it's it's just it's really really

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
interesting i'm looking forward to

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,440
spinning up the off grid livingston

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000

um uh one of the one if i'm not

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,880
repeating the

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,240
the things that people have already said

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,919
is compassion

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,039
um there's definitely like this

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,519
empathetic side to all the teams

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,240
whether it's you know if somebody's lost

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,880
somebody

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,559
if it's i'm just you know struggling

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,919
with working from home now

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,840
and people are willing to roll up their

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,640
sleeves and help each other out

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,200
or oh my gosh my kid's jumping in the

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
back of

my zoom meeting right now and you know

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,960
we just kind of keep going with it where

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
you just sit there and have a

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,079
conversation with somebody's child

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,000
because we're all

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,760
juggling something right now so that for

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,879
me has been

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,879
something that i love about sonotype and

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,440
then i'll throw out one other one

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,879
um and it's a line that if you know

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,119
better do better

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,320
and i feel like we all know how to do

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,320
things right and

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,240
we're not sloppy and we don't take a lot

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,280
of corner cut corners

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,280
it's like we know what good is and

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:49,839
we strive for that and everything that

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,839
we do and i love that about the company

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,079

it's just this passionate cool group of

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,599
people but i think

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,440
i know i i get this this cool sense of

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,359
many of the folks are very driven right

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
it's that combination of passion having

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,560
kind of a

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,240
will to do something better again it's

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,839
that constant learner constant

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,880
improvement you know a mantra that we

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,800
seem to have here that

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
everyone just wants to do better and

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
many folks have like a vision for what

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,320
that

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
looks like you know whether it's you

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
know something that's achievable

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
tomorrow or the next day but

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,200
it's just there's just so many driven

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,880
amazing people here that it's just

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,560
it's it's quite humbling right i'm

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
learning something new every day from

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
folks and

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,320

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
gps you know i'm trying to go somewhere

it's like it just constantly says

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,359
recalculating and so we're just kind of

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,800
constantly learning and being very

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,599
adaptable and i think that's

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,680
key also with this team is you know our

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
our agility right our ability to move

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,040

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,040
i can't can't ask for anything more

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,760
i guess i'll go um you know riffing on

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,079
what mike said

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,040
just now you know i think we we tend to

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,040
focus

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,800
the culture is focusing on solving real

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,040
problems right and not

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,720
not providing paper solutions that look

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,000
good on the website and that sound good

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,880
when you're sold but things that

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,520
actually

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,119
solve the problem and frankly from a

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,000
product management perspective sometimes

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,599
that creates friction

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,440
because people say they want one thing

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,400
and we know they actually need another

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,160
thing

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,320
and so walking that line and coming up

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,880
with the right right solutions for the

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,720
problems that stand the test of time

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,000
is a lot of work but it's fun because

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,599
you know you've done something

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,440
that matters at the end of the day not

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,280
something that just um

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,599
claims to do a thing that people think

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,359
they want but but doesn't really help so

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,960
you know i think that goes with the

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,400
stuff that everybody said here you know

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,880
driven passionate

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,440
innovative all kind of are derived from

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,640
that

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,640
that type of mentality

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,839
thank you brian um i think we've got all

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,920
of them

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,200
you don't mind one final thought here uh

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
i'd say also kind of like

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
leading by example and and anyone at any

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,480
level

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
is a leader and can be a leader but uh

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,839
kind of like you know just working

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,160
closely with the folks here on this call

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,000
i'm very uh impressed and certainly

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,040
humbled by the the amount of leadership

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,200
everybody here in this place

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,960
absolutely i will second that um

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
i know we're getting close on time i

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,680
don't think we have a lot of

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,520
other things planned so in terms of

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,280
questions we're happy to continue to

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,520
field some of those a few folks have

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,520
them

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,400
i will say in terms of some of the

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,119
things that you heard and takeaways on

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,320
why we think our organization is such a

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,920
great place to work

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,920
i think those are embedded in a lot of

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,680
the values that we have particularly in

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,200
the product organization i just want to

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,640
read off a couple because

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,480
they're kind of mirroring what i'm

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,040
hearing here which is what you want to

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,079

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,520
