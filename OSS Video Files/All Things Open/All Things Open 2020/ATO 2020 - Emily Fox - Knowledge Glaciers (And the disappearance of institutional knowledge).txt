Emily Fox - Knowledge Glaciers (And the disappearance of institutional knowledge)

TL: DR – The commoditization of innovation significantly reduces the learning curve to use each new capability & technology product brought to market. The corpus of knowledge that allows each generation to continue innovating is slowly eroding institutional concepts that lead to each innovation’s success. We are atrophying the basis by which modern technology upheavals are born.

Competition amongst technology monopolies and the hacking subculture of the 1960s, 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s pushed an emerging technology community to amass deep knowledge and expertise for research, education, revenue, and defense. Individuals would spend months exploring the vast complexities of these revolutionary computers and networks, learning how they operate, interact, and how they can be exploited. Retaining, sharing, and publishing any details learned enabled collaboration and breakthroughs only accomplished by building on decades of knowledge. This corpus of knowledge, a glacier if you will, is the basis by which modern technology upheavals were born from. The commoditization of innovation – the building of more complex, higher-order systems – significantly reduces the learning curve to use each new capability. While this brings many benefits to the bottom line and ease of use, the foundational knowledge of how everything actually works is slowly eroding away. The birth of utility computing (“as-a-Service”) in the early 2000’s shifted industry away from self-management of hardware (power, space, cooling, racking, stacking, and cable management). Companies adopting as-a-service to reduce their IT costs ended up decreasing local demand for hardware engineers and administrators. This shifted labor needs to service providers, ultimately consolidating infrastructure management knowledge. Fast-forward roughly a decade. as-a-Service is now a commodity and containers have made a comeback (everything old is new again). Cloud service providers themselves have felt the IT costs burden and are in the midst of increasing automation to lower overhead costs and increase revenue. Automation of orchestration consolidates more knowledge and further dilutes the skills, history, and expertise from which its manual antecedent was created. With each technology upheaval and adoption, the glacier becomes smaller, more murky, and harder to recall. These glaciers can be saved. It won’t cost us any technology revolutions. We don’t need to compromise on the use or continued creation of automation or cloud products to retain and grow the knowledge we want to preserve.

hello everybody

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,240
um i want to thank you for joining me

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,519
today and i will be talking to you

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
wonderful people

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,840
about knowledge glaciers and the

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
disappearance of institutional knowledge

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
i'm emily vox and i work for the

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,279
national security agency

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
a bit about me in case you are wondering

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,560
why i'm not wearing a suit and

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
sunglasses like most of the feds you see

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,679
in the movies

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,560
um i've been in security for over 11

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120
years

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,000
i used to be on the artisanal side of

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
security

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
um what that means is i followed a lot

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,879
of checklists

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,879
i didn't really ask a whole lot of

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
questions or kind of pontificate about

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
whether or not there was a better way of

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,800
doing security

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,559
i didn't know a lot of developers or

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,199
system admins very well

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,960
i understood what it was that they did

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,760
but i was told to focus on continuous

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,239
monitoring

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
or ensuring that projects that were

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,920
already rolling in production

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
continued to maintain i mean their

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,559
security maintain their security posture

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,080
um eventually curiosity got the better

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
of me and

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,840
as i see it's gotten for you too because

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,280
you're attending this conversation

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,880
um but

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
now i actually do a lot of very

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
different things i'm on a different side

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,119
of security

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
um i'm the devops security lead for the

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,960
national security agency and over the

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
past several years my primary job is

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
security advocacy and security

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,759
architecture integration

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,400
within the software development life

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,840
cycle you see i bridge two worlds

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
security and development

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
and they're definitely their own world

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240
if you've talked to a security person

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
or if you talk to a developer i was able

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,520
to get to this point by spending a lot

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,479
of time reading spending a lot of time

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
doing research

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
being integrated with developers and

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
administrators talking to development

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
teams

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
and their operations counterparts

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
understanding their pain points with

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,799
things like

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
getting an authorization to operate why

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
mutual authentication

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
is such a pain to implement how to

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,000
manage secrets in the cloud

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
and so much more to be clear i don't

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,479
know everything yet and i'm still

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
learning a lot

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,680
but it's something that i enjoy and that

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
i'm passionate about because i feel that

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
if i can understand

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,000
both sides i can help deliver better

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
solutions

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
so over these years i've gained a lot of

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
knowledge through my interactions with

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
the amazing technologists at the

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
national security agency

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
and the critical missions that we

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
support and i've also grown immensely

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
within the cloud native security

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
community first is a contributor then

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,200
technical lead and now co-chair to the

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
cncf special interest group for security

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
so today i want to share with you some

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
of what i've learned some things that

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
i've tried

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
some things i've observed and things

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,080
that are the result of either my efforts

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,319
or others within the community

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
but before we actually get started i

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
want to talk to you guys about a couple

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
things

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
and level set i do not possess a degree

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,319
in knowledge or history

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
i'm not an educator my degrees are an

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,680
information

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
cyber security and fine art i'm not a

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
computer scientist either

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
i'm not a software engineer i'm not a

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,159
system admin i am a security person

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
through and through

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
i just happen to know a lot about

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
development and sustainment

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
to be dangerous the information that i'm

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
going to be discussing today in this

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
presentation is derived from over a

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
decade of industry and government

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
observation and research

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
they are not an official position of the

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
federal government many roles industries

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
and organizations are discussed in this

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
presentation

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
one is not better than another and i

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,640
intend to present the actions and the

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,239
effects of each of these in an

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
observational manner

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
focusing on the knowledge impact so

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
let's start

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
knowledge glaciers are real and they're

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
melting

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,519
if you don't know what a knowledge

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
glacier is or you may have forgotten

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
since elementary science

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
here's a refresher a glacier is a slowly

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
moving mass or river of ice formed by

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,239
the accumulation and compaction of snow

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,519
on mountains

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,120
or near poles hey i'm emily yes sorry

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,319
sorry to jump in i

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
wasn't sure if you were not moving

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,319
slides or

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:57,360
oh no yeah hold on

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,840
okay let me jump back my apologies

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,439
everybody

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,120
um my slides don't have a whole bunch of

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
content on them but i will try to make

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,400
sure that i don't pause the presentation

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
again so thank you for catching that

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,439
brand i appreciate it

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,840
um so glaciers

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
are actually melting scientific research

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
has shown that

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
the overall mass of glaciers on earth is

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
reducing at an alarming rate due to

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
environmental factors beyond the

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,680
glacier's control

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
and this should sound vaguely familiar

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
to you as it seems like nearly

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
everything

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
in 2020 is beyond anybody's control

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
according to the national snow and ice

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
data center glacial ice often appears

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
blue

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,280
when it becomes very dense and free of

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,520
bubbles

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,000
years of compression gradually make the

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
ice denser forcing tiny air pockets out

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
from between the crystals

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,199
when glacial ice becomes extremely dense

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
the ice absorbs a small amount of red

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
light leaving a bluish tint in the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
reflected light which is what we see

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,000
this means that the oldest and purest

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,240
parts of the glacier are the bluest

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
so what are knowledge glaciers knowledge

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
boosters are an accumulation and

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
compaction of deep knowledge that's

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
built over time that provides

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,960
foundational understanding as community

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,840
knowledge expands

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,360
and guess what these are melting too the

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759
advancement of technology

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
expansion of automation consolidation of

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
expertise

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
and many other factors are reducing the

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
amount of and the completeness

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
of institutional knowledge being

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,840
transferred from one technology

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
generation to the next

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
over half a century of technology

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
expertise has forged glaciers of

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
knowledge

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
accumulating or transferring the stents

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
of knowledge is difficult and hard to

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
successfully perform

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,440
within a team let alone an entire

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,880
community years of knowledge compression

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
have gradually made the depth and

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,320
breadth and knowledge denser over time

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
forcing out those tiny time-specific and

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,960
application-specific pockets of

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
knowledge between innovation bursts

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
what remains is a pure foundation of

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,160
knowledge from which innovation is born

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,600
and then commoditized now

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
as with glacial melt there are

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
environmental factors to consider

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
expected productivity and velocity a

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
culture of curiosity that generated

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,440
innovation and upheaval is disappearing

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,400
knowledge gained is evaporating because

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
we are so busy

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,240
trying to move forward faster than

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,319
everybody else technologists are

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
expected to be productive immediately

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
when organizations are getting more

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
efficient and providing technologists

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
enough information to get them moving in

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,199
the right direction they're not arming

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
them with enough information to make

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
better and more informed decisions

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
in this technologists are being hardened

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
and masked to produce an object

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,600
a thing to be a cash cow of an

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
organization if it isn't making cash how

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,840
is it helping make

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
cash career alignment

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,680
career girls are being tied to product

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
delivery a lot of individuals see the

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
success of developer advocates and big

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,120
personalities in open source as the

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
alignment of the stars for where they

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
want to be

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
they see the product launch of a highly

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,360
enviable project as the

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,599
trajectory for their own personal

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
success some in the community

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
even hunt for the next cutting-edge

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
innovation to either launch them into

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
stardom in the community

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
or wealth to the next big thing

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
organizations even

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
encourage this model of thinking because

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
it drives product development

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
further feeding that cash cow

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,599
organizations need to reach beyond

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
horizon one

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,960
to horizon two and three but in reaching

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,639
these goals

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
they end up trampling the knowledge and

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
growth of the individual to get there if

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,080
they do not carefully nurture

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,000
their continuation and advancement cloud

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
the birth of utility computing as a

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
service in the early 2000s shifted

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
industry away from self-management of

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
power

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
things like power space and cooling

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,199
racking stacking and cable management

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,280
technology companies attempting to offer

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
utility computing began to sweep talent

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
pools for highly skilled and experienced

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
costly individuals to make their

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
offerings more robust

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,479
resilient and competitive in the

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,240
emerging market companies that began

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,039
adopting as a service to reduce their

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,560
i.t costs

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,639
end up decreasing local demand for

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,639
hardware engineers and administrators

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
few reinvested in these human assets to

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,240
keep institutional knowledge within this

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,280
and expand their relevant skills this

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,800
further shifted labor needs

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,400
sorry this further shifted labor needs

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
to service providers ultimately

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,240
consolidating infrastructure management

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,759
knowledge and leaving an entire formerly

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
desired community to abandon and

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
suppress

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,199
knowledge and take up a new trade craft

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,199
or evolve to meet the new market demands

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
for which very few of them actually had

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
expertise in outside of the service

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,680
providers

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,039
automation cloud service providers

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
themselves have felt the i t

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
cost burden and have been increasing

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,479
automation to continually lower overhead

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,880
costs and increase revenue

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
automation of orchestration consolidates

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
more knowledge and further dilutes the

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,640
skills

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,880
history and expertise from which its

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,640
manual and ascendant was created

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,120
automation does many amazing things

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,800
however manual processes and procedures

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
that were error prone can now be defined

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,120
in exercised repeatedly

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,040
with the same expected result do it once

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
and apply it many times over

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,800
that knowledge about why we do it that

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
particular way is not captured in the

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
automation process itself

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
just the manner in which we accomplish

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
the feet how often

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
do you find code without a comment

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
explaining why it is there or what it

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
does

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,959
were you able to understand the comment

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
without looking somewhere else in the

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
docs

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,519
would you be comfortable deleting it and

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
confident in understanding the impact of

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
that deletion

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
do you ever revisit code of unknown

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
origin

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,240
abstraction cloud service providers and

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
an effort to protect themselves from

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
their and their customers

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
from each other institute layers of

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,760
specialized controls and abstractions

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,519
limiting just how much you can tweak or

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,279
configure their offerings

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
they need to make it easier and faster

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
for their customers to move on to the

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
next big thing

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
in a safe way and their customers want

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,839
this in many cases the manner of

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
mechanism by which this is performed is

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,680
kept confidential and proprietary

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,839
because it's the thing that enables them

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,519
to be highly competitive within that

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
market

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,560
it gives them that advantage this is

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,720
extremely difficult to understand

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,760
sorry this makes it extremely difficult

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
to understand how

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
a cloud provider is meeting compliance

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,560
security and even regulatory

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
requirements

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
aside from a certifications body such as

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,600
fedramp certification

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
or a certification standard such as fips

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
140-2 being

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
attested consumers are left to trust but

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
unable to verify

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
many of these claims so you're at the

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
point now where you're wondering why is

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
there a security person

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
sitting on the other end of the camera

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
talking to you about knowledge and

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
glaciers

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,320
has to do with technology security right

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
or even just technology

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
bear with me there are two main points

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,720
that are interwoven throughout this talk

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,040
that i want you to be mindful of without

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,920
knowledge we cannot be informed and if

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,760
we are not informed we cannot be secure

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
consolidation and automation can make

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
security life easier

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
consolidation and automation without

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
transparency can obscure and

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,760
inhibit actual security

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,360
security professionals and technologists

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
cannot just know they're part of the

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
development cycle

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
their fiefdom and be done with it we

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
must also have knowledge of the

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
technology how it fits into the bigger

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,560
picture

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,800
the history of the technology to a

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
certain extent how it arrived here

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,240
all the historical vulnerabilities for

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
it because inevitably someone failed to

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,279
implement a regression test for at least

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,880
one of them

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,560
if we're not appropriately informed

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,360
about how things function

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,120
and why it is done especially the why we

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
cannot make appropriate recommendations

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,000
to mitigate resolve or even transfer

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,600
risk

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
this is the exact same thing that

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
project teams need to understand before

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,000
they can begin developing a product

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,839
identifying what the actual problem is

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
before we can design a product to solve

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,160
it

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,800
identifying what the product's going to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,880
do in order to secure it

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,200
while consolidating reporting streams

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
and automating a lot of manual processes

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
like account creation

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,639
can make our lives easier we need things

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
to provide context around those

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
vulnerabilities we are seeing

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in a dashboard if an exploit path is

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,959
present for instance or if there are

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
active or mature exploits in the wild

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,959
and we need to know the basis of that

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,360
context because what we often see

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,120
is difficult to discern relevance from

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
and we end up relying more on the

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,800
automation to do our jobs

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
than the actual skills that enabled us

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,519
to do them in the first place

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
so i'm going to give you an example they

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
didn't fully understand what was

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,600
happening

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
and then the confusing cacophony and

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,680
warning alarms and alerts

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,240
they could not regain control killing a

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
total of 346 people

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,000
this is an excerpt from npr digging into

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,160
why two 737 max airplanes crashed

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
it turned out boeing's flawed design of

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,720
a new automated flight control system

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
was a major contributing factor

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
so i want you to think about this for a

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
minute we can destroy

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,079
lives if we fail to take the time to

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
understand

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,120
without having transparency and how

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,839
automation

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,440
works understanding what it is showing

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
or where things are coming from

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
we can destroy lives the more that we

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
automate

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
without transparency into how the

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
automation works

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
without taking the time to understand it

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,279
we are losing

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,279
valuable skills and knowledge that may

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
eventually be catastrophic to another

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,120
human being

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
or even the entire planet as we've seen

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,959
in this past case

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
we need to pay attention and we need to

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,320
make changes

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,440
but we cannot make changes until we

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,920
understand how we got there

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
our technology history is steeped in

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,680
research and defense

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
seeking to understand and seeking to

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
secure

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
we have moved very far away from this

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
and we've moved that far because we've

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,519
lost our culture of curiosity as a

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
community

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
and the things that helped us cultivate

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
that

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
individuals used to spend months

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
exploring the vast

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,440
complexities of revolutionary computers

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
and networks

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,519
learning how they operate interact and

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,920
how they can be exploited

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
they retained and shared and published

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,519
any details

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,360
learned and enabled collaboration and

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,360
breakthrough is only accomplished by

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,399
building on decades of knowledge

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,760
prior this corpus of knowledge or a

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
glacier if you will

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,480
is the basis by which modern technology

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,639
upheavals are born from

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,519
the commodity the commoditization of

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
innovation

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
the building of more complex higher

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
order systems

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
significantly reduces the learning curve

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,760
to use each new capability

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,079
because we assume that the knowledge to

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,000
develop it is imparted to the generation

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,240
using it and this is not always the case

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
christine lagarde made the following

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
comment on climate change that i think

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,680
is particularly relevant to the current

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
state of knowledge glaciers

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,120
it's a collective endeavor its

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,320
collective accountability

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,959
and it may not be too late consider that

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,199
as we move forward

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
in order to win world war ii we needed

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,199
to increase the input and processing of

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,040
the existing computers we had

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,120
and they were human at the time and we

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,240
can only do so much with humans

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,760
ibm's ascc otherwise known as the mark 1

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
along with the electromechanical

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,120
computers that of that era

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
were designed to solve advanced

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
mathematical physics problems to support

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
the war effort

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
soliciting knowledge across multiple

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
federal and non-federal groups

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,279
the u.s was able to modify and improve

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,079
the ideas of the edvac

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,240
mark 1 and eventually the univac the

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,320
need to increase speed and better tests

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,440
for inputting data into this equipment

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,040
led to the creation of the a-08-1 and

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
a-2 compilers

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,279
which then led to the concept of

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,839
keyboard input and then fortran

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,600
these were major innovations in a long

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,079
line of innovations that came before

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
them

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
but for the purposes of this talk we're

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,920
going to start here

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,120
what were our innovations from the 40s

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,680
and 50s

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,199
the methodology of actually writing code

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,600
or software development

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,680
was a byproduct of getting more accurate

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,079
results from the mark one

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,160
the concept of reusable memory was being

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,880
exercised for the first time

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
we see programming tests being literally

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
hand written

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,519
and then encoded to ensure the machines

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,519
were configured correctly

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,040
and the concept of compiling code to

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,399
enable more efficient use of the

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
computer

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,399
as we continue to build on the success

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
of electromechanical computers and many

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,920
other technologies from that time

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,440
we're beginning to see computing take

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,759
hold as a potential commodity

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,680
technologists in the 60s and 70s

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,440
realized we needed faster ways to

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,320
communicate with this new medium and

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,519
thus began the era of telecommunications

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,399
ascii basic and unix are all key

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,000
innovations here but continuing on that

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
collaboration idea

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
arpanet now becomes the internet or

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
precursor of it

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,519
and emails are being sent pong has

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,399
officially made its debut in this era

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,240
and thanks to the apple one and apple ii

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,399
personal computing has potential

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,839
and we see text-based rpgs make an

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,759
entrance

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
what were the innovations of the 60s and

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
70s

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
email the ability to send a message and

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,559
receive a response

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
faster than the postal service faster

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,559
even potentially than other

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,880
communication mediums at the time

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,679
the internet or internet connecting more

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
and more people

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,039
every single day the concept of computer

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
gaming

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
that computers could be used for much

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
more than mere calculators and can

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,839
provide an entertainment value

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,319
to consumers microprocessors that enable

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,400
computers to do more than just one thing

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,080
with telecommunications now being a

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
largely expected presence

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
for the future of any organization's

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,679
success we're seeing network systems

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,919
becoming the next commodity

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,760
enabling enabling technical play and a

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
rising counter culture looking to poke

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,240
and pry at these existing

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,000
wide open architectures

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
with more and more people owning

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
personal computers and getting online

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
or passing laserdiscs now cd-roms with

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,240
games on them around

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,240
curiosity is pushing people to test the

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
limits of this new playground

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,520
using it in ways the creators never

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
thought possible

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
do you think that grace hopper or the

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
u.s navy would have ever predicted that

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,160
the mark one's ability to calculate

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
trajectories to support a war could

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,799
contribute to community

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,120
focused on entertainment in the 1980s

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,000
the morris worm wreaks havoc on the real

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,400
internet

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,720
the first felony connection in the u.s

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
happens as a result under the 1986

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
computer fraud and abuse act

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
industry and government are starting to

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
pay attention to the counterculture that

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,960
is growing in the internet

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
and freakers wreaking havoc in their

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
wide open insecure telecommunications

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
networks

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
what were our innovations of the 80s

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,280
better memory

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,880
floppies cd-rom flash all contributed to

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
our ability to continue refining and

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,799
making computers more powerful

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,799
word processing enabled more efficient

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,000
and consistent communication within

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,320
and across organizations globally c

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
plus was created and computer security

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280
awareness appeared in the media for the

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
very first time

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
think about how many times it's appeared

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,960
since then

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
everyone is now getting online and

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,960
companies are seeing

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
a new space e-commerce to increase

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,160
revenue and reach new markets that they

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
didn't even know existed

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
a growing need for security experts is

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
becoming apparent

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,120
and the internet is now the next

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
commodity

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,919
in a rush to tap into the e-commerce

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,320
potential companies began buying compute

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
they bought space they hired people they

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,520
needed tons of admins and developers to

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,559
bring their brick and mortar presence

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,240
online

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
many of these individuals came out of

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,520
that counter culture because they were

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
the only ones with the knowledge of how

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,760
these new systems and networks ran

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,760
we see skills like system admin network

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,679
engineer and server hardware technician

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,360
becoming some of the highest paying and

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,799
highest demand jobs in the market

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,880
alongside developers

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,880
but we also see configuration drift

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
making its first appearance

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,640
companies needed flexibility in making

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
their online presence possible

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
and with the counter culture of freakers

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
and hackers now becoming

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,440
professionalized

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,679
we begin to see more open source and use

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
what were the innovations of the 90s

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,600
linux arguably the most

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,440
widespread and most used open source

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
project in existence

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
web browsers enabling internet access

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
for companies and consumers alike to

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,080
that e-commerce market space

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
wi-fi which enable technologists to move

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,280
about free from wires and still be

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
online

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,440
and online transactions getting paid

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,120
electronically for goods and services

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,799
rendered only available now that

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
ecommerce was alive

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,080
and java still one of the top languages

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
in use today

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
maurice willis could not have said it

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,480
better this was the world in which i and

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,480
others of my generation had grown up

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,720
and we saw the the possibilities of

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,760
achieving with these means very high

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,919
speeds with elegant economy of equipment

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,919
however maurice wilkes could not have

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
predicted how relevant his experience

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,640
would be

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,799
across thousands of others almost 40

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,640
years later when he made this quote

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
with internet access we begin to see the

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,559
rise of e-commerce and digital startups

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,919
to solve non-technology-oriented

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,600
business needs

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
consumers will expect to buy things

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,840
online through digital transactions

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,679
service to service communications are

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,280
emerging as the next commodity trend

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
companies are now beginning to feel the

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,520
pain of those 18 gains from the 90s

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,720
some making the drastic jump to create

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
utility computing

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
saying this is the next need by industry

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
automation

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,600
and skills consolidation that i talked

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,600
about earlier are starting to happen

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
we begin to see the knowledge loss and

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
skills management

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,799
organizations begin to shift and offload

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,400
their technical debt in favor of

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
outsourcing home-grown and

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,679
unsustainable solutions to companies

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
arriving on the scene

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,799
that can solve these problems for them

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
teams focus

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,679
more on doing one thing well and i mean

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
really well and selling the service

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,440
the beginnings of career and product

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,159
alignment appear as individuals dive

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,400
deeper on major problem areas

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,600
agile and devops make an appearance and

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
gain a following

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
as more and more companies realize

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
waterfall development is simply not

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,080
sustainable for reacting to market

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
changes

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,320
teams are relying heavily on the most

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,880
senior person and as ian coldwater put

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,280
it

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
recognized by the epic beard or fabulous

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,320
hair to come in

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
and save the day and then disappear in a

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
cloud of smoke when your metrics

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
if you even had them started flashing

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,159
green again

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,280
so what were our innovations utility

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
computing

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,120
it only exists because of the networking

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
languages and the compute that came

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,520
before it

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
devops recognizing siloed teams cannot

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,600
be enough for high

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,120
velocity product delivery an agile a

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
better way to develop software

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
these are all great things and we've

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,600
done a lot

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,600
as a community the world isn't on fire

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,720
arguably it is but that's not the point

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,520
of this talk

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
so consider this in order to work on the

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
univac

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,559
in 1951 you had to have an advanced

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,520
mathematics background

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,400
and experience in a very very exclusive

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
field

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,840
today you don't even need to be familiar

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
familiar

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,559
with the fundamentals of networking to

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,880
create an e-commerce site in aws

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,760
or even be strong in any programming

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,720
language

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,559
we've made it that easy but what is the

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,799
cost

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,159
we are relying on the tools we use to

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,559
work properly

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
and when they break there are very few

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,480
individuals who know how things work

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,039
before those tools were integrated

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,799
or why we chose that specific tool to do

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,880
that particular thing

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,159
and a lot of them are actually nearing

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,120
retirement

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,039
in less than 30 years we will have lost

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,159
most of the generation that gave us the

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,960
chance to create

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,919
and experience netflix alexa and

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
fortnite

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,000
and this is where we're at we've got

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,679
developers cranking out code using build

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,279
kits and pipelines to make their lives

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,640
easier so that they can deploy their

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,200
ideas to production

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,279
and this is great we've got admins and

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
operators cranking out the same scripts

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,760
and watching

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,440
beautiful colorful charts reporting all

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,880
microservices are green

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,799
with no error codes how many of us know

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,880
what those metrics are actually looking

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,679
at to determine green yellow red or

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
death

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,919
or what the script we copied from stack

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,000
overflow actually does

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
where that dependency came from and what

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,520
else it has in it

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,960
this is the struggle balancing velocity

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,120
with knowledge

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
the epitome of security is knowing as

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,440
much as you can about what you have

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,279
what you will have what you don't have

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
so you can implement a balance of

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,679
security controls and compensating

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
mechanisms to ensure your customers data

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,120
does not end up plastered all over

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
tomorrow's news headline

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
there is a huge part of me that wants

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
developers and admins to know everything

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,520
about what it is that they they do take

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,360
the supply chain for instance

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,200
do you know where that library actually

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,120
came from are you sure that you spelled

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,360
that package name correctly

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,880
in the age of kubernetes and everybody

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
getting fancy with the names of their

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,640
projects

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,559
it makes it so easy for you to get owned

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
because of a typo squad

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,640
but i realize i can't expect everybody

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
to do everything no matter how much i

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,200
want them to

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,960
there's another part of me that wants

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,039
them to know everything about security

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,120
while they are coding or deploying

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,799
because then it makes my job easier

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,320
although i also probably wouldn't have a

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,559
job if they did

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,559
but i can't expect them to know security

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,159
or be able to download my brain so they

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,880
can make better decisions

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,039
it's not realistic we only have so much

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
room in our personal knowledge base

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,400
something has to go and for most of the

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,559
technical community

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,039
it's not what they do every day or every

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
week then it's prone to getting lost

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,240
and the glacier starts to melt so how do

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,159
we enable ourselves to innovate

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,320
how do we build on the knowledge of

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,039
others in an informed and transparent

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,279
way

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,240
how do we ensure the security of what it

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,240
is that we're building

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,080
we build on the knowledge that was

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
formed before us

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,559
if you can't understand how it works

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,799
today how it worked yesterday

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,360
you can't get to where you need to go

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,080
you need to engage in systems thinking

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,880
understand it end to end as much as you

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,000
can

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
don't be afraid to ask questions and if

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,159
the documentation

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
sucks submit an issue and take the time

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
to be specific and provide a

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,600
recommendation if you can

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
the extra five to ten minutes that you

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,480
spend explaining it will save someone

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,200
else an hour trying to understand it

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
share inner information universally to

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,679
advance

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,240
knowledge share what it is that you

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,320
learned and solicit feedback from others

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,000
make it easy for everyone else to get

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,240
involved and help

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,159
you need to amplify those feedback loops

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,600
to become actionable

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
give a talk on what it is that you

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,679
learned or what you did

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,480
listen to what other dids others have

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,480
done

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,760
read the words they took the time to

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,480
write and don't do it in a vacuum

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,919
be okay asking for help or asking for an

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,080
explanation

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,080
be accepting that others need knowledge

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,000
and be willing to share it

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,679
we need to promote and cultivate a

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
culture of continual learning and

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,440
experimentation

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,679
we lost it and we have to get it back if

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,440
we want to continue to innovate

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,360
we need to accept the challenges that

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,559
come with this and enable changes to

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,960
make it safe to fail

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,279
fast i went through a whole lot of stuff

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
and i went through it very quickly so if

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,080
you happen to

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,080
have fallen asleep and are completely

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,600
lost and don't understand how to save

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,120
the knowledge glaciers

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,200
don't worry here's a quick recap nurture

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,159
the people that you have to expand their

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,480
skills

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,799
do not abandon them you need them

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,039
whether or not you realize it yet

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,919
they provide a unique experience and can

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,399
diversify your way of thinking

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
encourage your teams to learn together

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,799
no one

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,159
individual can be responsible for

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,440
successfully relaying

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,600
institutional knowledge not everyone is

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,240
a born educator and some people just

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,080
don't like talking and that's okay give

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,159
them opportunities that suit them to

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,559
collaborate and shine

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,559
documentation is important but making

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
documentation available and easy to

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,679
understand

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,600
is the most important thing we cannot

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,399
save knowledge if we cannot find it

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,919
or if we can't understand it this also

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,919
means making it available

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,279
in multiple languages and multiple

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,799
mediums

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,039
if someone took the time to write it

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,720
down it needs to be read

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,559
make the time to read and encourage

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,480
others to do the same

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,840
find the balance between velocity and

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,720
knowledge and we can save the knowledge

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,159
glaciers

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,080
thanks everyone so i am going to

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,960
stop sharing so i can jump in the chat

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,960
and see what kinds of questions i have

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
that was great emily yeah cause you're

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
you're checking that

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,720
um yeah it's this is spot on

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,640
i mean this is uh really um

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,640
my my own personal job being able to

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,600
find people that can

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,480
that know assembly you know or or cobalt

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
um

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
that we need um you know to work on

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
systems it's

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,760
it's it's kind of uh that knowledge is

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,320
is is gone and it's it's really hard to

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
find

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,520
i don't i don't even know if assembly's

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,640
taught anymore you know

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,200
in college i mean so yeah i mean

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,760
it seems like there's everything is is

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,399
just

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,039
get it out quick ship it fast um you

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,080
know

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,120
just run this routine and um

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,919
no this is uh and i'm i'm trying to read

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,120
some of the comments here people are

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,159
yeah lots of great comments it it's very

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,399
much true

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,080
uh scott made a good summary of it we're

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,080
standing on the shoulders of giants but

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
when they inevitably die it is a long

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,720
way down

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,200
it the problem with lack of knowledge

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,679
like

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
um people don't understand the concepts

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,960
behind

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
uh telecommunicate basic

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,799
telecommunications or electronics or

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,760
radio

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,679
or they have this overwhelming fear to

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,600
try to figure something like that out

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,520
and that's really where

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,279
we have to as a community like move

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
forward and overcome that

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,399
so if you're at an event and you have

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,799
questions

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,320
ask them don't be afraid to put yourself

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,039
out there i know that it's a really hard

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,960
thing

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,960
software developers and even security

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,120
folks are mostly introverts

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,480
but you're among introverts and you're

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,840
you're among the community in the family

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,200
so brittany had a question uh wondering

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,640
if there are any institutional

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
initiatives that could help support the

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,679
effort to preserve the knowledge

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,200
glaciers especially at a university

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
level could there be government programs

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
to help incentivize and support the

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,799
preservation of these skills

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,399
i don't know of any institutional

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,840
initiatives that kind of

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,159
work in this space the only way that

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,679
i've been able to actually dig into a

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,120
lot of these topics

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,000
is through lots of reading um

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,520
exploding the phone was an excellent

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,880
book to talk about like

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,919
the 70s and 80s um

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,200
actually in the slides

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,360
deck which i had linked um there is

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,640
a book on the information age which has

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,880
a lot of really great information from

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,440
the 40s and 50s and how we got there

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
um you kind of have to like dig through

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,880
youtube talks

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
i mean youtube if you want to talk about

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,799
institutional initiatives

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,320
youtube is probably one of those things

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,760
if somebody's got something to talk

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
about they're going to record it and

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
post it there

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,399
going to conferences like these that

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,600
make um the videos

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,240
open and available those are really the

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,360
the

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,919
mediums to do it um

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,360
matt had a question any thoughts on the

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,279
last point finding and preserving

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
knowledge for teens typically

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,799
typical challenges and kms and intranets

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,880
isn't so much as getting things written

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,279
but it's still a big pile of notes which

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,640
rot that that's very much true um

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,600
there's so depending on your

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,000
organization

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
and how much support that you have

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,159
especially if you

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,200
are dedicated to improving the developer

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
experience which

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,440
um nsa actually has a team of folks i'm

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,000
on that team as well as a couple of

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,159
others

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
that i've talked at this conference you

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
need to like

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,080
put together a documentation library and

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,399
socialize that that is the place

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,000
for everybody to go and don't just keep

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
it with a few people that have right

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,840
access

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,200
you need to crowdsource input make it an

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,880
inner source effort within your

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,159
community or within your organization

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,919
your best folks that are going to have

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,440
the most knowledge are probably

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,200
not going to be the ones with time on

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,559
their hands to sit around and write a

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,559
few articles for it

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,120
so you need to have that champion that's

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,240
going to them and picking their brain

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,240
or encouraging them or standing behind

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,760
them clapping and pushing them along to

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
get those articles written and get that

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,320
knowledge

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,159
out of their brain because ultimately

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,440
they are that one person that comes in

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,679
and saves the day

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,360
and you need everything in their brain

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
for the next generation because

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,519
they're going to want to leave they're

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,120
going to want to retire they're going to

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,840
want to go on vacation and you need all

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,840
of that knowledge

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,039
um so i'm catching up on

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,519
chat uh

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,880
and kevin says in a professional sense

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,000
one of the worst feelings is when you

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,600
fix something

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,360
and the institutional knowledge is no

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,960
longer available

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,600
yes that is very much true there is

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,399
especially as we move into this next

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,919
decade

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,200
2020 and beyond there's a lot of changes

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,000
that are going to be

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,039
coming up on the horizon within the

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,880
technology and even

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
within the security community security's

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,159
kind of been hanging in the background

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
watching everything in the cloud and

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
cloud native happen and now we're

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,760
starting to see a little bit more of a

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,960
push

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,360
forward so getting

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,320
those things documented considering how

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,159
the thing

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,760
the ways in which we've done security in

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,559
the past are the ways in which we have

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,640
done

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,240
technology virtual machines

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,320
infrastructure is code

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,919
fully documented about why we've made

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,000
those decisions is going to be

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,760
important for the next generation of

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,280
security and technologists that need to

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,240
come back and revisit

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
because one day serverless or the thing

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,119
past

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,879
serverless is going to blow up and it

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
will be the next commodity

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,079
and we're going to be sitting around

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,320
scratching our heads like

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,119
han do you remember back in 2005 when

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,079
aws

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,800
launched how did that happen and how did

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,399
we get there

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
and now we're dealing with serverless

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,280
and then whatever's going to happen

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
beyond that that's even scary to think

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,320
about

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,200
it's like it's like lab audits i used to

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
manage a lab

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,399
and we had to show the auditor exactly

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
okay

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,760
this file resides on this you know

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,679
mainframe here and now like with the

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,760
clavo where does it really reside it's

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,040
it's everywhere like you know who owns

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,560
it and where does it

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,800
if you needed access to it you know

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,800
there's

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,359
very very uh confusing now yeah so jeff

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,720
made a good point

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,640
um that there's sometimes the pushback

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,480
against basic computer science knowledge

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,200
and i talked about this a little bit and

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
that

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,480
everybody wants you to be productive

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,560
immediately and that means

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,160
that the organizations and colleges are

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
not necessarily teaching

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
the history like usually there's a

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
computer history class that you're going

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,480
to take but realistically the idea is to

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,640
get you the skills that you need to get

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,079
outdoor and get the job that you want

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
because that's what you want to do is

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,480
you need to start paying back all those

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,599
student loans and you want to be

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,640
successful

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,800
but having the ability to contextualize

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
what basic computer history and basic

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,599
computing knowledge

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
is most important for where you want to

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,920
go is

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,040
key and being able to identify that

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,599
figuring out

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,240
if i'm a web front end developer what

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,640
things

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
in history what were those big things

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
that pushed it forward

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,079
that i can leverage in the future

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,920
because having that thread

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,760
all the way across the timeline allows

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,760
you to think at a bigger picture

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
and think at a strategic level instead

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,280
of a tactical level where you're staying

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
in your own swimlane and only focusing

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,160
on what it is that you do

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,160
and that's what really allows people to

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,000
be successful all those big

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,000
personalities and open source that are

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
giving all those fabulous talks

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,520
their ability to think strategically

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
because they had the knowledge behind

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,680
them

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,680
is what's making them successful

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,440
i think i've got another question oh

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
i've got a lot of questions

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,440
oh i answered those um brittany wanted

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,760
to know

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,240
if the talk is going to be posted

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
anywhere

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,240
we uh we are recording um and i i

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
believe they are going to be made

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,880
available

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,320
afterwards um

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,680
so there is joshua has

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,280
posted an excellent point in a chat

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,280
from the ieee standards association

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,880
uh we're making a big move to support

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,599
open source incorporated into big

00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,720
standards

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,560
do you think that this could play a

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,240
significant role if we had a healthy

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,680
community developing consensus standards

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
and better improve our best practices

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,280
technology specs and

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
conformity assessment programs so this

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,400
is it's funny that you mentioned that

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,640
joshua because i

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,520
literally was just having a conversation

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,960
with a colleague

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,720
um today about that that there is

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,400
everybody seems to be afraid to create

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,160
standards and specs within the open

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,440
source community because

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,960
heaven forbid we have to follow

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,119
something everybody wants to do their

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,320
own thing and in fact all of our

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,480
missions and the things that we're

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,560
working on are all slightly different

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,240
but i think at some level having a

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,240
framework extracted

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,280
is important for the community to move

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
forward with

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,040
and definitely getting active

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,760
involvement not only from

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,880
industry but from academia and from

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,400
government

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,640
in the same room having those

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,960
conversations because ultimately

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
problems that either you're seeing today

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,160
or you're predicting in the next five

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,839
years is probably something that someone

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,079
else is already dealing with

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,680
and they might have even already solved

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,560
so definitely putting something like

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,880
that together

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,680
would be a huge benefit to the community

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,280
but again it has to be made

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,880
in a way that's understandable and

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
digestible to the majority of the

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,359
community

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,040
and even still making it available for

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,079
everybody that isn't considered in the

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,839
majority

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,440
we need to do a better job of reaching

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,200
out um

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,599
let's see lots of good points lots of

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,200
excellent chat i'm glad everybody liked

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,440
this i i do want to do a quick

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,359
shout out this talk would not have been

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,040
possible without a conversation i had

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,800
with kelsey hightower about this

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,839
particular topic

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,720
so um big props to him for kind of

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,400
pushing to make this known

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,480
contextualizing is key yeah like

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,320
if you're in an organization and you're

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,960
getting pushback from your leadership

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,400
or from your teammates about documenting

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,599
things

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,960
just one thing will happen and then

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,079
everybody will be like

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,680
oh we should have wrote that down and

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,839
don't let it go

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,839
be the dog with the bone about it keep

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,119
writing them about it that they need to

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,200
actually take the time

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,200
and document these things because

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,920
thinking about it and having hindsight

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,240
about it

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,560
is not going to solve the problem if

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,200
you're doing blameless post-mortems

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,079
that's great if you're not please start

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,720
doing them

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,680
but do the next thing after actually

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,520
read through them

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,040
and take your lessons learned and turn

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:35,599
them into issues and tickets to get

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,599
