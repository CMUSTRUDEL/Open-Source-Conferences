Title: The Terazo Durham Work Experience - Kim Thies
Publication date: 2020-10-28
Playlist: All Things Open 2020
Description: 
	Presented by: Kim Thies, Terazo
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Jobs Track (Day 1)

Abstract: The first time we laid eyes on the American Tobacco Campus in Durham, we knew that it was the perfect fit for Terazo's growing NC team. It offered both open and private space, plenty of room for collaboration and hosting the events we loved pre-COVID (and when safe for all, will one day resume). The campus is chock full of innovators and entrepreneurs, and bursting with diversity in the heart of this little city we love so much. These traits reflect the culture of Terazo - a work environment that is inclusive, energizing, entrepreneurial and creative. Our team has grown significantly since opening; and while this year's pace has been slower due to the pandemic, we have added some great new leaders added to the Durham team in 2020, and continue to seek top tech talent to join the team for upcoming roles. Join us to learn more about Terazo's culture, team and future opportunities!

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320

major areas we have devops we have

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
software engineering and data

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,560
engineering within that we have a

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
variety of engineers

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
and our engineering roles start at

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
associate for those that are newer

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
in their career and move all the way

through senior then we also have lead

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
roles as well

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,799
so the leads manage teams of engineers

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,079
and work directly with our customers to

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
solve problems

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,920
we also have architects which is a new

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,200
role that was added over the last

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,000
year on my team so excited to have those

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,920
and then we also have engagement leads

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
which are the folks that really provide

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,319
oversight of our projects

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
interact with our clients and ensure

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
everything is on track and go in as

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
planned

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
we have a variety of customers across a

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,400
number of industries

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,879
so we work with finance with health care

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
we have logistics and supply chain

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
customers and we've even worked in the

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
transportation area

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
and one of the things that i'm most

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
excited about at least on our team is

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,319
the opportunities and the possibilities

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
that have opened up

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,000
this year um with telehealth

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
so covid has brought a lot of negative

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
things to every one of us

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
some of the positive things that have

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,280
happened have been in the healthcare

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,239
industry where more people have access

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
in a variety of ways to doctors nurses

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,959
services

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
that are desperately needed especially

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
in remote areas

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
so that's one of the problems we'd like

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
to work on and continue to solve here at

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
terrazzo

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
we are a very values-driven organization

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,000
so one of my favorite

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
core values that we have at terrazzo is

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,760
meaningful work and by meaningful work

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,879
what we look for is opportunities to

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
work with companies

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
who are doing exciting things stuff

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
that's really cool for our engineers to

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
build

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,959
but also meaningful to our community
