Abstract: The first time we laid eyes on the American Tobacco Campus in Durham, we knew that it was the perfect fit for Terazo's growing NC team. It offered both open and private space, plenty of room for collaboration and hosting the events we loved pre-COVID (and when safe for all, will one day resume). The campus is chock full of innovators and entrepreneurs, and bursting with diversity in the heart of this little city we love so much. These traits reflect the culture of Terazo - a work environment that is inclusive, energizing, entrepreneurial and creative. Our team has grown significantly since opening; and while this year's pace has been slower due to the pandemic, we have added some great new leaders added to the Durham team in 2020, and continue to seek top tech talent to join the team for upcoming roles. Join us to learn more about Terazo's culture, team and future opportunities!
