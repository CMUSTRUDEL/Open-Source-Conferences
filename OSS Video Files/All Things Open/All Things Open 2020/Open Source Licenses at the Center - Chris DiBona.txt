Abstract: Open source is now a mainstream component of software development and culture. With this growth and normalization of open source, the license is often taken for granted, and we forget its role in shaping the project and community well beyond just using the code. Chris will talk about these overlooked dynamics, and remind us why itâ€™s important to keep open source licenses at the center.
