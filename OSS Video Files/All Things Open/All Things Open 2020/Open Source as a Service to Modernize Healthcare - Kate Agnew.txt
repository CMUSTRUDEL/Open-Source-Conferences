welcome everyone

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
um it's good morning for me i'm in

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
minnesota

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,480
um in minnesota where it is so

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,160
wonderfully snowing today um i know a

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
lot of you are in north carolina and i

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,119
know that you know people are

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
are joining this conference from really

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,199
all over the world

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
i'm and i'm one of those like crazy

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,160
minnesotans that that goes crazy

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
uh for the snow i'm also like your your

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,800
typical minnesotan and that like

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,360
obviously the first thing that i

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,840
introduced was the weather um so

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
thank you all for joining today um i'm

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
talking about open source as a service

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,000
to modernize healthcare

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,719
and really thinking about the ways that

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
we create that community

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,800
around open source technologies within

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,399
united health group and

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,199
more specifically opt-in optum is the

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
technology arm for united health group

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,640
um so

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
people haven't always heard of optum but

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
sometimes people have heard of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
united health groups so i like to read

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
it in that

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
today i'll be talking you know through

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,119
these examples of the ways that we

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
create this community

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,280
and all of the teams that i mentioned

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
today are also hiring which is why this

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
falls under the job track

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
i'll reference more of those specifics

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
at the end of the talk

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
and then today for my example of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
creating community i'll really be

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
rooting in the example of kafka

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
it's one of my favorite open source

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
solutions and it's used heavily at optum

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,720
so

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
i will be going into depth on that but

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,759
first

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,600
i will give everyone a little bit

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,119
about me uh so kate agnew i'm a director

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
of software engineering

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
at unit health group i've been here for

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
three years

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,280
and my team of engineers stands up kafka

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,280
cassandra and elasticsearch as a service

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,360
to the enterprise

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
i'm really passionate about diversity

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,799
and tech efforts

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,079
so i'm a part of the united women

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,000
leading in technology initiative uw-lit

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,479
and i'm the former managing director of

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,920
the nonprofit girls in tech based out of

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
the twin cities here it's a global

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
organization but i was a part of the

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,319
minneapolis chapter

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
i have my bachelor's of arts in math

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
from macalester college in

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,560
saint paul minnesota and i obtained my

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
mba from mit

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
unrelated to like everything that i do

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,879
in the tech world

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,360
i'm also a planning commissioner for my

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,920
local city uh government here

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
and then i'm also on two boards i serve

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
on the macalester college alumni board

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
as well

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
as the board of a all-girl stem charter

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
school in saint paul called laura

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,920
jeffery academy

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
um i also used to have a podcast it's

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,440
called drinks with her

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
and then i kind of stopped it when i got

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
pregnant and i wasn't drinking

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
and then kovit happened and i was like i

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,720
don't know if i want to do it remotely

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,640
but it's definitely something that i'm

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,239
going to be spinning back up so

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,920
if listening to women

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,000
drink and chat about really fun uh

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
fun stories is appealing to you make

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,920
sure you check that out

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
i'm at work i try my hardest to keep up

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
with um

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
band shirt thursday which i introduced

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
to the team i'm a huge fan of the band

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
hanson

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
like yes bob hansen and so every

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,720
thursday

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
the team rotates through and we wear

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,560
different band shirts

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,239
and i also collect simpsons action

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,440
figures so i don't have any in view

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,720
right now but trust me they're out there

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,879
um so why optum i'm i

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,280
i've been here for three years now um

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,519
and just really passionate about using

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
data and using technology to

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
really impact people's lives and i felt

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
that healthcare could be the place to do

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
that

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,480
so when i joined the team um the

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
footprint of kafka was

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,959
like zilch and there were maybe a couple

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
of teams that were standing up

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,439
kafka on their own but nothing that was

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
standardized

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
and at the time we really needed a

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,080
repeatable

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
scalable way to standardize and expose

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
data to customers

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
and i'm going to walk through this model

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
not because it matters for the talk

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,519
today but really just to set the

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
foundation

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
of why we chose some of the open source

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
technologies that we did

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
and so this model here really walks

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,880
through

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
you know we have a mainframe we use

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
change data capture

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,040
and then we have raw data streams going

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
through kafka we do a standard

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
standardization layer within cassandra

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
we have the standardized kafka stream

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,479
and then we build materialized views in

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,120
cassandra or elasticsearch to create

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,040
enterprise apis that then consumers use

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
to tackle that data

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
so everything that you see here is open

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
source except for

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
cdc um for those of you not familiar

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,479
with change data capture

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,560
it really just like taps into the

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,000
transaction log and that's what

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,639
it ports into kafka um and i think that

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
we've used different products for cdc um

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,199
but that's the only one that isn't open

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
source

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,680
um knowing that we wouldn't be able to

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,280
do this pattern for all data across the

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
enterprise in a silo

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,639
we really chose open source technologies

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
because we wanted to

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
change the culture and empower teams to

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
fully

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
understand the technology they were

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
implementing

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
so open source obviously enables teams

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,919
to really lift up the covers

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,600
while using the public internet um to

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
solution and troubleshoot for anything

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,240
that they run into

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,360
um why kafka specifically

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,080
uh honestly like everyone else was doing

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,680
it um there were some large retailers

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
who had enabled their

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
multiple fulfillment options by

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
modernizing supply chain management

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
through

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
the use of kafka and then of course like

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
linkedin created kafka to facilitate

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,039
activity tracking and to solve the

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
question of

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
the problem i guess of how all data and

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,520
applications in a big digital company

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,000
become plugged together

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,600
so today at kafka

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
we have a pretty large footprint i won't

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
go into like the all of the nitty gritty

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,199
details on this

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,960
um but we're managing you know over 500

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,160
nodes across two data centers

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,319
um almost 600 customers

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
and so what started out really really

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,440
small has become

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
a huge offering um to the enterprise and

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
and i'll kind of take you through some

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,080
of the specifics of that journey

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,080
i think this is the interesting part

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
because it shows uh

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
and i won't belabor this too much but i

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
think it really shows

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
you know where we came from within the

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,120
organization of

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,960
kafka you know just being run by a

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
couple of one-off teams to where it is

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
today

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,120
and it's really exciting because we're

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
doing this you know not just for kafka

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
but we're doing this across a ton of

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
different open source technologies

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,000
and it's a really exciting time to be at

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
our organization

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,360
and i had a lot of fun with this slide

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
because of the animation so i'll go i'll

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
go quickly through it but

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
um so in 2017 we really started on just

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,319
a couple of vms

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,919
um we needed it for our own use case of

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
building out that eligibility

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,479
data eligibility is just a healthcare

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
term that really checks you know is a

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,400
member eligible for certain services

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,880
and so we were building out these

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,000
eligibility apis so we had an

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,000
a single eligibility um source of truth

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,919
that we were then creating a couple

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,319
topics off of to then bring through that

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
chain

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,400
to create the materialized views

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
but soon we realized that building it on

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,759
vms just wasn't the most scalable for

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
what we needed

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
um part of it has to do with you know

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
kind of the oh

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,680
our own internal um bureaucracies of

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
spinning up vms and the management of

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,560
the vms so pretty soon

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,120
um i acquired 400 400 no uh

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,199
40 servers for our use case which was

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,840
really oversized at the time for what we

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
needed

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
uh but at the same time it's hard to

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
purchase

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
uh servers within a fortune 6 fortune 7

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,319
organization

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,319
and so i wanted enough that would meet

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,560
our needs for at least the short term

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
and at that time we were really dog

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
fooding so

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,800
creating it for our own needs um

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
honestly because

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
proximity to the to the customer is key

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
and and really in those early stages

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,800
and you can't really get closer than

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
yourself um

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
at that same time then people got wind

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
that we had acquired these servers and

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,599
so they're like oh hey can i just like

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,240
maybe get a topic or two on your kafka

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,560
and

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
and we we naively said sure we have the

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,919
space we can do that

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,080
um and then like before we knew it um we

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,080
created what was then called kafka as a

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,040
service prod kaz prod

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,240
uh because all of these customers that

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
all of a sudden you know just wanted a

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,200
couple of topics at a time

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,080
we're saying oh hey we're going to

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
production now um so we started

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
really ramping up that offering one

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
continuing to make sure that kafka as a

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
service was what we needed for our own

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,320
use case

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
but then bringing on more and more users

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,560
so we had hundreds of topics

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
um and a couple of other clusters that

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
we stood up so people brought their own

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
vms and we ran the kafka for them on

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,200
their own vms

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,839
at that time it was really um

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
me kind of surveying serving as product

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,080
owner

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,200
finance and strategy and roadmap and

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,920
kind of all of the non-engineering type

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
stuff

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
and then i had luke luke was my main

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
partner in this

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
my only partner in this and at the time

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,160
he did literally everything

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
so in all of our github documentation

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
you know he was running

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
a system in prod for like i said a

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
fortune 7 organization

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,000
and he just listed his cell phone number

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
um he had a flip phone at the

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
well no he still has a flip phone um

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,279
because he's that kind of techie

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
uh which is fantastic but yeah he

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,519
literally just had his flip phone phone

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,720
number

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,600
in our github documentation and so as we

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,000
continued to scale and to grow

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
we started leveraging pagerduty and this

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,680
really made it a little bit simpler

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,480
to offer that 24 7 support

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,600
uh and then made it so that we could tap

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,000
in a couple of our

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
um people going through the technology

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
development rotational program

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,279
um it's something that we have at optum

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,440
we call them tdps

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,680
but they're really straight out of grad

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
school or straight up of undergrad

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
and they go through two six-month

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
rotations and so we had a few of those

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
folks on our team and we wanted to get

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,000
them into the

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
the spin of supporting a production

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
environment

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
and so they joined our on-call support

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
we also then brought in a team in india

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,079
we created a rate card so that we could

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,279
begin charging people for our usage

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,200
and all of a sudden we had this

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,640
non-production environment that had

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,760
already achieved 1000

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,079
pull requests we then

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
also in 2019 started spinning up

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,680
footprints at azure

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,600
we had specific workloads that needed to

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
be run there so we said sure

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
let's try and do that so running at

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
azure was purely

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,920
on vm still at that point as well

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,519
um early this year which i mean it seems

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,959
like it was a really quick journey but

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,360
we achieved 1 000 um prs within our prod

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,519
environment and we also started spinning

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,440
up clusters as a service

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
um so the clusters as a service allows

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
us to

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
meet the needs of customers who have

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
bigger footprints

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,279
but ultimately what we do for cassandra

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,760
and elasticsearch

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,040
is we have we now have over 400 bare

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,480
metal servers which is why

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,519
i slipped earlier but we deploy

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,720
kubernetes on those servers and then

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,279
we deploy cassandra or elasticsearch and

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,880
then

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,880
now as of 2020 april 2020 uh we started

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
doing that with kafka as well

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
um so that really gives people a

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
dedicated environment as opposed to the

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
multi-tenant environment that is kaz

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,639
prod and kaz alpha

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,920
and so all of a sudden we had four

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
different flavors of

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
kafka as a service running within the

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,480
enterprise and then that's when we began

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
thinking more about kafka as a product

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
it was less about us

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
always responding to the newest flavor

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
the newest thing that customers needed

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
and we were able to take a step back and

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
understand

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
like how is this proceed within the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,800
environment what's the voice of our

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,040
customers what's the user experience

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,839
those things became a lot more important

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
obviously the bigger and bigger that we

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,519
grew

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,680
um then thankfully the team expanded

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,040
um at that point in time you know we

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,440
were still running

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
basically luke and then i think it was

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
really two

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
other engineers that were supporting

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
this environment and

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,560
given how big it was um we were

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,760
experiencing some burnout and so i made

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,720
it my top priority

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,720
to higher higher higher and to bring in

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
as many people as we could and i think

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
you know still figuring out like what's

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
the right scale of bringing

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
in a bunch of new people but also making

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
sure that you can

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
continue meeting on the deliverables um

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,120
so right now i think it's a team

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,800
of nine and that's supporting kafka as a

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,399
service specifically

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,240
and we still do have a couple of open

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,440
positions for that team in particular

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
um so right now footprint's huge uh

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
we're about to

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,079
achieve 10 000 prs in cas alpha

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
and then we're also exploring you know

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
where else should we make

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
kafka as a service generally available

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
um like i said before

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,839
um kafka's a service at azure is still

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
relatively bespoke and it's not as

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,920
automated as we need it to be

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,040
so we're building out the tooling needed

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,399
to scale better at azure or

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,360
or gcp or wherever else we decide that

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,199
that footprint needs to happen

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,639
so um what role does community play

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,639
and and where have we really been

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,560
leaning into recently

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
um like i said this was literally done

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,000
with a handful of engineers

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,839
um and really we were a small team and

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,279
we continue to be still a relatively

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,000
small team compared to what some of

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
these other teams

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,240
are you know you see across other

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,440
organizations or in other places they

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,959
might have 30 plus

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,199
engineers running their kafka as a

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,160
service and so in order for

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
us to really scale the offering that we

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,800
have we need to use technology for that

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
people don't scale technology does um

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
and this is really where i think that

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,839
community comes into play

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,880
um so do i have more autumn

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,639
animation okay um

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,079
open sourcely allows us to speak that

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,800
common language

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,199
a relatively common language so many of

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,920
our first users back in 2017

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,360
weren't familiar with github which made

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
our get ops method for

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
topic management a bit of a learning

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
curve um

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,160
this common language really means that

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,800
we can point people to the public

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,079
internet for tutorials on github or

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,560
when people are first starting out with

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,079
kafka we can point them to

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,279
over stack whatever um all of these

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,320
different places that

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,120
really are focused on what have other

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,440
people done

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
and what what else is out there in the

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
environment

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,440
and thankfully the need to

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,320
have people go through tutorials on

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
github has really waned out most people

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,120
are familiar with a lot of those basic

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,440
tools now

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,560
but leaning into that common language is

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,440
still an important part of what we do

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
and telemetry is really key on both

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
sides of the coin

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
so we need our clients to have the

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,199
ability to

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,680
answer what's wrong is it on the

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,160
customer side or is it on the host side

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,920
clients can use the community to stand

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
up their own monitoring and dashboards

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,839
to answer

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
this question but to go even deeper we

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
look for our users to troubleshoot

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,040
themselves first

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,759
try a couple of things research the

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,279
issue we always encourage teams to do

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
this by asking them

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,519
what have you tried so far and prompting

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,040
for this in our support intake process

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
as well you know please outline what

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,040
you've tried and what the results were

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,160
um so ultimately you know we do what we

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,240
can do and help

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,440
to help ensure that our users are

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
successful

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,480
but using kafka for an application

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,199
requires that the teams leveraging it

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
know enough about kafka to troubleshoot

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
and telemetry helps

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,160
them dig into that

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
automation so we automate wherever we

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
can

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
infrastructures code and ci cd are

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
really the only ways we can manage at

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,199
our scale with the engineers that we

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
have

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,880
and from the start the engineers

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,800
developing kafka have been

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,360
in the flows as we call them so we use

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
flow flodoc pretty heavily within optum

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,639
so they've been interacting with the

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,839
community directly

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,320
initially the kafka flow was started

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,399
in an effort to create that community

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
but without that clear definition of

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,320
what the intention

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
was for that it turned into a room where

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
we began

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,480
offering support and i think that that's

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
kind of overburdened that kafka flow

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
to date but regardless our engineers

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
have been

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,600
interacting with the users from the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,000
start which has really allowed us to

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,880
improve and address issues that our

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,480
users feel are the most important

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
next is documentation i think

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
documentation is literally one of the

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,799
most important things

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,559
for any open source software there's

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,480
endless documentation on these platforms

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,000
on the public internet

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,039
and we link heavily to those offerings

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
and those

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,960
information hubs in our own internal

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
documentations

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
but we also internally outline the

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,039
specifics to our offerings

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,039
walk people through getting started and

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,160
describe the nuances for operating

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,400
within our network

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,799
uh whether or not we are in the dmz or

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,799
within the core those types of things

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,480
and we really rely on our users to read

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,799
the documents first

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,799
again we can't always be there to point

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
people on to the right section of the

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,360
markdown and so it's really imperative

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,080
that we rely on our documentation to

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,600
scale and not the people

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
one place that i'd see us i'd like to

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,480
see us get even better as an

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
organization is through

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,200
contributing to the docs um so i think

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,440
that

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,440
99.9 of the kafka documentation has been

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,140
written by the kafka engineers

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,000
i would like to see more of a community

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,240
[Music]

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
environment where people feel if they

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,039
see something that might be wrong or

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
might not be as clear going in and doing

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
their own pr

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,160
which has happened a couple of times but

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
i hope continues to become

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,520
more and more popular as more of these

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,919
open source technologies are out there

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,400
and then don't just rely on official

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,360
kafka docs you know i always tell people

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,160
there are 600 teams using kafka across

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
the enterprise

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,440
and internally everything should be

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,679
public so

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
browse the uhd github for other code

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
examples see what other people are doing

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,760
out there

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,039
and and really what we try and how we

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
hone in on this

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,480
in our flows is you know where else have

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,400
you looked for

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,240
an answer to this before asking in flow

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
doc we don't really say it to call

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
people out

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
but really as an encouragement to get

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,039
people looking other places

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,080
um google it google it first please

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,799
um kafka is so widely used and there are

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
examples

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,520
of almost everything on the public

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
internet that you can do with with kafka

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,039
um so for example if you get an error

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
google it first rather than posting it

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,360
directly into the kafka flow

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
not only will our users get a quicker

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,080
answer

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,160
but then they'll learn from others

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
outside of the organization

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,760
or from others even within our internal

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,760
organization without having to go

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,480
directly to the kafka engineers

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,240
for that type of an answer this is how

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,760
we built the platform ourselves right we

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,200
googled everything

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
and it continues to be how we

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,480
troubleshoot so it works for more than

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,480
just kafka

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
clearly defining roles and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
responsibilities is also super important

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
and that's always

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,880
clearly defined within our terms of

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,440
service but we

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
run the platform and our client teams

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,240
manage their configurations and

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
implementations

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,159
so some teams want more assistance than

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
we have the scale to offer

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,360
and in these situations we can connect

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
them with third-party

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
consulting firms who may be able to

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,080
provide better services or

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,000
more timely services but ultimately this

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,640
is another spot where we really rely

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,559
on the community to come into play share

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,039
best practices

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,280
join together and not make the kafka

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,120
team the single source of truth

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,799
so giving the space for our community to

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,799
lean in here i think is really what will

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,440
be needed to help take kafka to the next

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
level

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
and like i said this kind of goes back

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,919
to the the chat right

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,440
um we had initially started it to bring

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
that community together

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,200
but have found over the years it's

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,760
mainly just pull requests

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,440
so how can we back that up and make a

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,440
community within the enterprise i think

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
is going to be really important

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,440
and becomes you know really one of the

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,559
backbones to offering out open source

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,360
software

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,400
um it's also one of the hardest pieces

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,120
to create

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,280
um so kafka user groups i think would be

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,880
really powerful in another um

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,400
i don't know maybe covet has actually

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
made this easier right but one of the

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,919
things about united health group is that

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,039
we're extremely distributed

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,799
and so you know we have offices in

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,640
new jersey and connecticut and north

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
carolina and california

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
and colorado and minnesota and even in

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,640
minnesota there are literally

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,640
i think like 15 different headquarter

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
buildings throughout the state

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,720
and so it really makes it difficult to

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,520
form groups that come together for

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,080
brown bag lunches or happy hours but i

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,960
think that

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,640
covid has made me just think outside of

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
the box a little bit more and realize

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
that we still

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,159
can really lean into this community and

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,280
create that space for community to come

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,600
together

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,760
um if we put that focus to it

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,360
um and so another thing you know is

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,200
really answering questions

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,880
our kafka flow has over 1500 users now

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,799
most of whom are using kafka on a

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,039
day-to-day basis

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,960
and so you know people that are in the

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,080
kafka flow encouraging those who aren't

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
on the kafka team

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
to also come and answer questions i

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,240
think is going to be really really

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,159
important

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,840
um and then i i would be remiss if i

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
didn't mention github as well

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,520
um we're still working towards making

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,720
sure every team

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,760
has their github internally public um

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,440
but i think that

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,039
you know all of these things together

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,919
will will really help

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,280
create that community that we need um to

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,799
ensure that

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,000
open source is successful um so we are

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,919
really just beginning

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,200
and great i left enough time for

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,720
questions i sometimes

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,280
feel like i'm gonna go and talk about

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,799
kafka for an endless amount of time

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,039
um but like i said we're only just

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,400
beginning um and if you want to

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,120
join us and be a part of this

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
modernization evolution we are hiring a

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,360
ton

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,919
um and so on this next slide um i've

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,520
listed

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,640
out our careers website um careers

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,480
dot unitedhealthgroup.com um my email

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
address is also on there and then i've

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,240
listed the job codes for a couple

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,000
of the positions within our our team

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,360
my team the healthcare cloud data

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
platforms team

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,280
falls under the broader healthcare cloud

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,360
organization

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,480
and so you know i went deep into kafka

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,039
today

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,039
but there's even within just my team

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,440
there's kafka cassandra and elastic

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,080
and then across the broader healthcare

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,919
cloud

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,159
umbrella there's a ton of other

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,000
technologies that people are rolling out

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,440
um there's the osfi team and i forget

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
what all of the letters stand for but

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
they basically manage the the openshift

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,440
the kubernetes as a service

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,279
um their kubernetes is a little bit

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
different from our flavor of kubernetes

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,080
given that we're building the data

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
platforms on top of that

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,360
um but there's you know there's a lot

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,320
out there and

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,520
you know cloud is in our name um my team

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
is one of them that's a little bit

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
nuanced because we have

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,400
quite a footprint on premises as well as

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,720
in the cloud

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,520
um but it's really about the internal

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,360
public

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,960
internal private cloud as well as the

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
public cloud and how

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
how we're bridging um some of those

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,919
barriers and

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,120
and i don't like to use the word hybrid

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
but thinking about

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,720
you know workload placement and when

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,000
should something be on premises versus

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,279
um in the cloud

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
and those are really important things

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,320
that we're thinking about

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,960
um so i want to i want to leave this up

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,400
but i also want to get to questions let

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,799
me see if i can figure out how to make

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
this work

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,960
all right so i will just like blank it

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
open it up for questions

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,039
um i think that there are the three

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,360
paths for doing this

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,200
um chat might be the easiest you can

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,559
also use like the actual

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,320
q a um or third option

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,679
is you could raise your hand and then i

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,720
think that i

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:57,919
i or ato will unmute you

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,919
so you can verbally ask your question

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
any i mean the questions can range right

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,799
um about optum

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,559
about our use of open source about kafka

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,640
about how we manage

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,840
um 600 users of kafka as a service for

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,200
the enterprise

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,360
um really anything that you're

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,679
interested in

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
how we're working to get more uh women

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,240
in tech is always fun

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,960
question two um okay so i got one

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
question

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,840
as a platform team who just started to

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,080
offer managed kafka cassandra

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,000
solar and elastic search on kubernetes

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,080
to other teams in our company what are

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,159
some things we should avoid

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
any blind spots or major problems you

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
faced

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,159
um so i think you know one of the first

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,799
things

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,919
that we made a conscious decision of

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,159
early on

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,000
is that we would only be offering out

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,279
these platforms

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,120
to teams that were doing that that flow

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,000
that i showed early on right

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
of taking raw data standardizing it and

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,480
then making it available

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,000
in materialized views for the enterprise

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,600
and i say this because

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,400
i think that that's really important to

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,039
have a specific use case defined

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,360
and not thinking that your specific

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,440
flavor or your type of elastic search is

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,679
going to meet everyone's needs

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,279
and so right now you know the flavor of

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,200
elastic search that we offer doesn't

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,600
even have our back enabled

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
which is probably a miss but because we

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,240
were working on it for just very

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,720
specific use cases

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,400
we didn't have that many customers that

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,640
were looking to

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
um you know have a ton of people working

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,480
within their elastic

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,080
and so it worked now we're getting to

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,000
the point in our maturity curve where

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,440
we're thinking about offering out

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,520
elastic search more broadly

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
and we really still focus in on what's

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,120
your use case are you building those

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
materialized views are you pointing apis

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,960
at what you're building

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
because there are other solutions out in

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,440
the enterprise that are going to meet

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,559
the needs

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,159
for different things right so logging

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,760
the elasticsearch is often used for

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,559
logging

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,360
but there's a team at optum that manages

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,400
splunk

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,159
as a service and so there

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
that's not something that we want to get

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
in the business of supporting that

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,720
logging specific use case

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,679
and so my advice is just be very kind of

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
intentional about what are the use cases

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,440
who

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
are the customers that you're going to

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,520
support and really go through a vetting

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,559
process to make sure that those

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,039
those customers

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,320
are fitting within that use case i think

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,080
specifically

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,440
one thing that we're also struggling

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,360
with right now

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,200
in deploying on kubernetes is the

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,600
ability to scale

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
um so we've we've given customers the

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,399
ability to

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,919
define the size of their initial cluster

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
and those initial clusters meet their

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,960
needs for a couple of months and then

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
they say

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
hey i'm going to need more capacity and

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,360
so scaling in place

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,200
is i think one of the the harder things

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,440
to do with kubernetes

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
we're getting pretty close to it i think

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
it's something that we'll have

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,240
early next year but customers are always

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,600
going to need more use cases are always

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,399
going to grow footprints are always

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
going to grow

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,440
so think about the ways that you'll do

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
that going forward and it doesn't

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
necessarily mean that you have to be the

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,720
one to enable that

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
scaling but in in the case of you know

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,360
cassandra elasticsearch

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,159
make it relatively easy for a user to

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,919
migrate to a larger cluster um you know

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
maybe even with with copper right

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,679
um stand-up mirror maker as a service so

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
that they can replicate their data

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,640
pretty easily

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,039
and then get off that smaller footprint

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:41,760
and and move over to the larger one

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:44,799
um when they inevitably need to scale up

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,399
um so we got another question i'm a

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,480
graduate student are there any full-time

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,360
opportunities for new graduates

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,120
i'm so for both undergrad and grad

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,080
students i usually recommend

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,760
the technology development program tdp

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,159
and that program i think is is really

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
great

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
one because i started in a rotational

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,720
development program myself

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,360
and i really like the ability to rotate

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,880
through different teams because

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,480
i mean i guess i'm a director of

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,200
software engineering but i literally

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
still don't

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,120
know what i want to be when i grow up

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,880
and so the ability to

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,480
start a new career or start you know at

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,159
a new company and be able to rotate i

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,840
think through different teams

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,120
really sets someone up for success not

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,520
only you know in navigating the

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,360
ambiguity and figuring out how to like

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
jump jump into a team and ramp up

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,080
quickly but seeing

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,120
how different teams work and function

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,120
you know my team it i absolutely love my

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
team but my team is very different than

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,480
you know a lot of the other teams across

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,360
the enterprise and you're not going to

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,279
know that

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,559
what the team is like that you're

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,240
joining right away

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,320
until you get a chance to explore a

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,799
couple so it's the technology

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,840
development program and you can

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,080
just search for that on

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,480
thecareers.unitedhealthgroup.com

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,480
website

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,159
um any other questions that i can answer

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
otherwise i'll talk about the fact that

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,480
i'm wearing a cape today these things

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
are awesome

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,240
all right i will give give everyone one

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,679
more minute to ask a question otherwise

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:37,840
i will wrap it early and you can have a

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:37,840
lunch break

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
i'm so piggybacking on the last question

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,919
i was a data processor

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,200
analyst at a university is optum a

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,679
friendly environment for

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,880
career changes and starts um

00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,159
so yes i think so i

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,640
in 2017 literally ran through four

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,240
different

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
job shifts i just finished grad school

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,320
and didn't again

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
really know what i wanted to do

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,120
and so i was i did digital marketing

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,399
data analytics for a little bit and then

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
i joined a startup

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,840
where i was employee number seven at an

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,360
artificial intelligence communication

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,120
software firm and then i

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
got i mean it was a small startup i got

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,600
laid off after a little bit from that

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
um and then was a campaign manager for

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
someone running for reelection for

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,000
minneapolis city council

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,600
um so this is all to say that like you

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
can have like any kind of journey and

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,399
then like the next job that i got i

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,320
started working at optum

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,919
um this is now officially the longest

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,519
that i've ever been at a company

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,519
and so i think that you know as long as

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,600
you're able to tell that story and tell

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,240
how um what you've done helps build to

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,399
what you will be doing at optum there's

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,440
no reason you you have to have had

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,720
direct experience in

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,640
you know even like the specific

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,000
technologies or in

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,600
the boots on the ground work that you'll

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,519
be doing if you can show that journey

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,080
and how you learn and adapt to new

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,080
environments

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,039
am i eligible to apply for tdp for june

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,760
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,120
2021 start if i graduate in august 2021

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,720
uh technically no

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,640
um but there are four different start

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,360
dates throughout the year

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,120
so you still just apply to that same one

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,880
you just wouldn't start in june you

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
would be placed probably in the october

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,320
class because i think it's

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,480
april june october

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,679
and december might be the four classes

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
that they do every year

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,799
and so you would just be joining into

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,080
the next one then um from whenever you

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,720
graduate so you just won't start in june

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,600
what is the most important value when

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,880
hiring

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,720
candidates um this

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,799
varies uh greatly obviously depending

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,360
on who who the hiring manager is i've

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,720
hired

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,120
quite a few people already this year um

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,960
i look for the ability to like

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,279
troubleshoot and learn on your own right

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,320
i usually will ask people to

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,960
walk me through a recent

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,600
technology or software that they've

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,760
they've self-learned or recently learned

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
and walk me through how they began that

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,240
learning process

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,919
so yay spoiler if you apply for one of

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,840
my teams i'll probably ask that question

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,960
um but what i'm looking for is an

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,279
understanding of

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,960
how does someone tackle something that's

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,679
ambiguous how do they get started in

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,440
learning to

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,720
new technologies what are they googling

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
what do they do when they get an error

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,320
message

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,279
what are their trusted sources i'm just

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,480
really trying to

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
tap into how they learn because

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,240
i'm fully anticipating that you know the

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,519
next person that joined my team isn't

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,440
going to have

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,279
three years of kafka two years of

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
cassandra

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,640
you know experience with kubernetes

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
right like we use a lot of

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,240
technologies that and some of which are

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
going to probably be new for people

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,279
and so i'm just more curious about how

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,360
do they learn how do they

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:10,639
ingrain themselves within the team

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,200
uh is there a degree requirement for

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,200
the tdp program uh

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,599
i think that there used to be i think

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,200
that they at one point required computer

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,599
science

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,240
but related to that i see the other

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,520
question

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,599
of no college degree and just having

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,119
completed a coding bootcamp

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,200
on this year things have changed for tdp

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,639
and they're actually opening it up um so

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,639
as a part of that they now

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
are accepting applicants who have gone

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,200
through coding camps so

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,079
yes to the question about having done a

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,560
boot camp

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,320
um but i don't and i so i would assume

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,919
that they have also opened up

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,919
which degrees courses they

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,599
accept applicants from but i do not know

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,160
100 that answer

00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,839
if you email me though i can um research

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,839
it and follow back up with you

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,440
all right well like i said my emails are

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,000
still on the screen

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,240
um there's our website and then just a

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
like a sampling of a couple of the job

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,760
codes

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,280
um you know for example one of those um

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,320
software engineering jobs

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,480
would be joining the the mq team

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,800
so helping to modernize our messaging

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,880
platform into a self-service offering so

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,400
taking kind of an established product

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
within the organization

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,160
mq that exists today and and really kind

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,839
of

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,200
mimicking in some ways you know like the

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,960
self-service model that we have with

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,520
kafka where anyone can come and

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,960
and spin up their own topic um so how

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,320
are we doing that across the other

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,520
technologies that may have

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,359
more legacy roots within the enterprise

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,680
and then for our product roles in

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,119
particular you know we're looking for

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
i only have two listed here but i think

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,280
that there are at least three open

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,359
positions

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,119
for innovative product managers to join

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,760
the healthcare cloud team

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,400
across the board i have one opening for

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,640
akafka

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,440
product owner specifically but there are

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,040
a couple of

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,200
others across the other products but

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,880
really looking for people who can help

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,640
advance our products and services to

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,240
making sure that you know critical

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,320
healthcare applications

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
and data are available in a secure and

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,520
reliable fashion

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,040
so thinking more about the road maps the

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,839
funding the strategy

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,119
and of everything that boils into

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,640
creating these products

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,560
across the enterprise is something that

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
we look for our product owners to lean

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,920
into

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,599
so with that thank you so much for your

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,160
time thank you for the great questions

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,680
and follow up with me if you have any

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,119
questions or if you're interested in any

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,079
of these roles and you just want to chat

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:49,520
some more

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,520
