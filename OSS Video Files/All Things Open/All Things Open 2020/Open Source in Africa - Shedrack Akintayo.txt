Abstract: According to Github reports earlier this year, A certain number of African countries have been listed amount top contributors to open source and also users of Github. Countries like, Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana were all listed. In this talk, I'll talk about how open source is shaping the future of software development in Africa, very important communities supporting open source in Africa, and key players supporting open source in Africa. I'll also suggest better ways companies in more developed countries around the globe can support Open Source development and Software in Africa.

organized by

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,280
open source community africa the i think

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
the one the biggest

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
open source community here in africa i'm

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
going to talk about

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600

advocate at cloud foundry foundation

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
um we're an open source um platform as a

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
service

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
and we provide one of the best developer

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
experience on kubernetes

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,079
and i'm also technical writer i write

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,720
some of my doing my free time for log

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,640
rockets

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,600
on my personal blog and magazine

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,479
so africa let's talk about africa we all

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,399
know africa

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
that's right africa is one of the most

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
populous um black nations

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
black continent of the world um it's

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,240
basically a continent with various

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
countries in it like microchip country

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
in nigeria

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,159
it's based in africa um we have various

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
countries ghana namibia

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
etc um africa is quite populated i guess

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
one of the most

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
most popular black um continents in the

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
world and the only black continent in

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
the world

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
um uh africa is populated by about

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
point two one six billion people that's

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,480
about 2015 this should be

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,879
about 1.5 billion now in 2020 um

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
currently africans major so the way

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
we've painted africa is africa

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
has food oil africa's mineral resources

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
etc but

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
currently as i think africa's major

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
resource

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
is talent we have various challenges

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,959
designers developers engineers

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
across the world working for different

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,920
companies in silicon valley

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,440
in canada etc so we have a lot of

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
africans watching working for any of the

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
five fortune 500

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,680
companies um google um shopify

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
et cetera now let's take a look a

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,599
look at the git object of the october

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
2019 i mean most of us here when you're

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
in open source

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
most of the code open source code we

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,800
have is hosted on github

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
so i mean the details of the october um

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,159
2019 report

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,200
it shows that a couple of

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
places have increased over um over the

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,840
course of 2019

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,319
and the highest growth is seen in the

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
increase in nigeria with 59 percent

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,640
growth as of

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,360
last year as of 2018 which is not a big

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,440
um a large number of growth um we've

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
seen contributions from

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
kenya which is also an african country

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
about 45 percent

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,200
um tunisia morocco it's like

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,239
so digging in basically this particular

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,599
countries here have one of the highest

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,440
countries the highest growth and

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,120
contribution into open source

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,920
so africa is becoming a very global

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
um a global community for developers

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,560
contributing

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,920
in um open source and we as opposed to

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
coming to africa we are trying to make

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,519
this even much more bigger as that by

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,480
the time the twin 20 reports

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,400
out you can get this um report by going

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,959
to october the github.com

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,439
um the next talk the next thing we

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,920
should

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,799
see is division of spotlight to africa

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,879
so code and creativity are obviously in

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,920
russian so penn africa like i said

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
africa's major

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
resource is the talented people

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,280
individuals that we have here in africa

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,759
um developers here created 40

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
more open source repository in the year

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,720
in 2019 than 20 2018

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,320
which is a higher potential growth than

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
any other continent

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
in the world this is a very very big um

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
growth for us so we saw about 65 percent

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
increase in morocco

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
kenya about 54 percent then nigeria we

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
saw 50 percent

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
um egypt we suffered 90 cents and south

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,320
africa

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
we saw 45 which is a lot of goods coming

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
from africa

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
from larger developer communities like

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
those in morocco kenya

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,960
we saw about 70 more percent in growth

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
and contributors

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,320
in 2019 than 1820 and just imagine how

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,759
the numbers would be like numbers would

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,960
be like in

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,039
um 2020 or 21.

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
so let's talk about oscar now open

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,840
source community africa like i said is

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
the biggest

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
um open source community here in africa

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,840
where we

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
um are creating the community of of

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
course that are driving the open source

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
movement in africa

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,320
it was created basically to encourage

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
more african developers

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,840
to contribute to open source projects

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
and advocate for

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
open source movements in africa its main

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
goal

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,800
basically is to ensure that africans

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,880
not only use the software and hardware

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
created by other continents but also

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
create

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
these technologies this open source

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
technologies that a lot of us are using

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
or a lot of people across the world are

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,400
using

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
now oscar x2633 is about five countries

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
looking forward to

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
crossing the um whole of africa in the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
coming years

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,199
um we have on people in utopia

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
we have countries in um communities in

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
kenya we have communities in nigeria

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,720
we have in syria alone we have in

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,800
zimbabwe

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
this is where our marks are currently

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,919
have we've currently reached

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
uh we're looking forward to reaching the

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
entire africa

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
we have currently in 11 cities and we

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,400
have a thousand plus members

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
and we're going to talk about i'm going

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
to work further about the open source

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
festival that we had in february and how

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
the structures of soccer harry had over

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,800
visit us from various parts of africa

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,919
and the world

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,960
so these are cliffs short images from

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,160
various people across africa in

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,199
the meetups we've um we've done to talk

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,759
about open source

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
in africa so this particular one is

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
basically about um

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,720
we also encourage designers also to get

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
into open source not just

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
um developers we also encourage more

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,000
women as you can see from the images

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
here we have a lot more women

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,919
um in contributing to open source so our

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,599
community community here open source

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
community in africa is really diverse

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,840
because

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,599
we are encouraging every single person

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
you respected for your agenda

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
whatever you do i think that you can

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,319
create you are

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
you are eager to learn about open source

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,000
we encourage ourselves to get

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,360
into open doors so oscar project so this

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
is what um the open source community in

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
africa has been

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
up to so the first thing i'll talk about

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,199
is the open source festival

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
so the most successful that happened in

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
cincy um between february 2020 earlier

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
this year before the whole kobe 19

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
happened

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
um it's basically going to be an annual

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
open source garden of uh enthusiasts and

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
contributors from

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
all around africa and other parts of the

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,280
world so we had folks from

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,759
google we had folks from um

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,759
from github we had folks from a couple

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
of big organizations in silicon valley

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
50 for us we also from macbooks

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
visit us here in lagos nigeria because

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,440
it was hosted in lagos nigeria

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
to come and talk about um what they are

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
doing open source and how to

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
get people other people involved with

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,319
the open source we saw about it was a

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,479
three-day event and we saw about

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
5 000 people from different parts of

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
africa and also other parts of the world

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
come to africa to

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
um talk about open source it was really

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,039
a moment of glory for us in africa

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
it shows that the amount of people that

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,039
are willing to get into open source here

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,720
is very very high so like i said our

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,319
community here in africa is

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,800
very very diverse so we encourage women

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
to come into open source women and young

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
girls and

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,319
girls in general to come into um of

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
opponents also with women of oscar so

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
women of australia open source north

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
africa

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
is a joint effort by shikha africa so

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
she could africa is a non-governmental

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
organization here in nigeria

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
and africa generally that brings young

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
girls and women into

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
um coding so we added a joint effort to

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,719
dance to introduce

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
and train more women into um women and

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,360
girls into open source

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,839
generally um we saw an increase in

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
um the attendees for the attendance by

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,320
of women

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,160
and girls grew by a very large number

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
when we started the agreement of open of

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
oscar

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,320
and we're looking forward to be more and

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,519
getting more women and girls

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,560
into open source so oscar and so

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,680
while um we're expanding we're growing

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,000
um we are collaborating with open source

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,360
um open collective bounds to the uh to

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
generate advanced creative bouncing

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
program

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
i mean while open source is supposed to

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
be free i mean there are some times

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
where you need to actually encourage

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
people

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,640
by giving themselves in certain

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,120
incentives to do um open source

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
um so a collaboration with um open

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
policy basically we needed to introduce

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
more people

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,959
in open source by paying contributors to

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
pick bug on

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,480
um open source collective projects so if

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
you go to any open source collective

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,240
and specific projects and open source

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,600
collective on your github repo you with

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
two setting tags

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,720
titled oscar bounty so those bounty

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
when you finish um you send the pr to

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
that they would

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,839
um send you uh maybe 100 depending on

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,760
the price of the particular

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,800
um open source um

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,320
um um a particular issue so

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,519
this has we've seen a lot of growth from

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
this because it's a lot of people like

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
that you got to

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
um a lot of students a lot of young

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
people that are eager to

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,440
complete the bouncing program which i

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,000
think is a good idea

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
um a incentive for growth in the um open

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,920
source space in africa

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,720
um so the very important one i

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
personally like

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
i'm a developer but i feel like um

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
designers are not like not really

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,720
um giving the chance to show their work

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,000
in open source so here in africa we

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
like i said our community here is

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
diverse so we're able to gather

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,360
on designers by starting the open source

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,920
design africa

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
so it is done by the wonderful um effort

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,640
of the design team

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
of us of open source communities just

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
because the shop designers get there we

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
contributed to open source

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
so here uh a lot of people i love i

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
don't know how they will contribute to

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,959
open source they love that i don't know

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
so

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,079
what we are um here is trying to change

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
the nicest that just developers

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
can change i can contribute to open

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
source so we have

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,959
technicalities and we also have open

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,160
source um

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,160
diners here that try to get more

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,440
than us into open source and we'll be

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,519
seeing like a good number of

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
designers that have contributed to open

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
talk

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,920
so connecting with um open source coming

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
into africa so you can check the website

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,040
www.oscar osmc africa.org for more

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
information

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
also you can also follow them on twitter

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,760
and you can also donate to the call on

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,600
open collective.com

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
oscar so that's basically it for oscar

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,480
now let's talk about key players in

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,640
africa

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
ecosystem if i'm about to show you all

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,720
now there are people that

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,000
have fought defies to fight basically

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
for on people to take

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,480
open source tops and development open

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
source um contributions seriously in

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
africa here

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,079
we have a very good number of people i

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
will not be able to talk about every

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
single person but we have

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
really really great people here and the

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
amount of people here do not do justice

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
to

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
the number of people that we have here

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
pushing the open source ideas

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
in africa so the first person i'd like

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
to talk about is something

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
so something is a special developer who

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
believes in changing the world

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,440
he's an open course advocate he has been

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320

years now

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600

whole open source community in africa um

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
a movement that promotes and educates

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
everything

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600

library that helps you create accessible

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,799
websites and apps by speed i would like

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,880
to say

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
i'm sure we just got into open source by

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,919
accident he built

he was a user interface designer and an

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,360
engineer before

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
from who he had the passion he had the

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,240
passion for design system accessibility

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
and product design

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600

for chat ui which um shows how

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
well open source would um stick um if

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,559
that's a cloud project that can take

stars on github and

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,039
it was built here in lagos nigeria which

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,559
wordpress

say is to sponsor more

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,240
