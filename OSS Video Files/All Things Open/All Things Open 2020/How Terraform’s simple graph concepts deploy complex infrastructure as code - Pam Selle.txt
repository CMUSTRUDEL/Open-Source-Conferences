Abstract: Terraform is an open source tool that allows you to define your infrastructure-as-code, and when you "apply" your configuration, your resources get made in the right order, but how? Graph theory! In this talk, we’ll go from assuming no knowledge of Terraform or graph theory to looking at how Terraform does what it does … and where it uses graph theory to ensure things happen when they are supposed to. We’ll even take a small, guided journey of Terraform’s source code and what paths it takes to load the config, build the graph, and how it walks that graph to turn it into real infrastructure. You will walk away not only understanding the basics of a really powerful tool but also seeing some of the awesome magic that makes it work!
