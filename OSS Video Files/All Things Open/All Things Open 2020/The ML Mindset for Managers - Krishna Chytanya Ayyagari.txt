	Presented by: Krishna Chytanya Ayyagari, Google
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Machine Learning/AI Track

Abstract: Machine learning is an important part of all tech products today. But not everything beyond excel sheets is Big Data and not all big data problems need Machine Learning. Machine Learning should supplement the product in the right way. In this session, we will discuss on (1) how a machine learning mindset differs from traditional software development mindset, (2) when and how managers (product managers or C-level executives) need to think of Machine Learning in their products, (3) how managers need to plan for Machine Learning in their products & (4) where to invest to achieve desired results with Machine Learning in their products. If you are a C-level executive or a product manager looking to understand and validate ML requirements in your products, this session is for you.

good afternoon everyone

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,679
this is krishna chaitanya casey uh i'm a

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
specialist customer engineer working for

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
google

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,520
based out of new york i'm here to talk

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,199
about ml mindset for managers

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,119
uh i have you know been working with

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,320
enterprise customers for quite a while

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,240
now i've had experience over 13 years

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,359
architecting solutions building

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,439
solutions hands-on

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
everything from end to end so in this

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,120
session we're gonna take

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,320
i'm gonna talk about my experiences in

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,360
terms of what it makes

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,440
or what what what it makes uh

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
good for having what kind of mindset you

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,559
need to have if you wanted to start

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,480
another project in your company

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,680
now what is that we want to do in this

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,520
session

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,520
we focus on first of all what is machine

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
learning i just wanted to bring everyone

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
on the same page here

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,480
i think i don't want to go into deep

00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
dive into what is machine learning and

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,719
the basics of it but

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
just as an introductory understand what

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
i'm all about

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
how different is machine learning from

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,840
normal software development

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
i wanted to talk about that because

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
that's a mindset which

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
you which your developers would be

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,080
having

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
which as a manager you need to be

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,560
understanding uh to

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
understand the different phases of what

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
it takes to build a machine learning

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960
model

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
i'll also take you through how to

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
represent

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,200
physical problems in data like you have

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,079
so many problems in your company how do

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
you think

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,159
what is the mindset also what is the cap

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
you need to wear to take that physical

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
problem

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
and understand represent that in form of

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
data

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
and then we will talk about those stones

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
and what to focus that's exactly our

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,240
point of discussion

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,479
and i'll i'll conclude by what should be

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,840
you thinking as a manager in your

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,360
products

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,360
now this is a standard definition of

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,840
machine learning if you go ahead and see

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
it's a study of computer algorithms that

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
improve automatically

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
now the important part is this is gerard

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
from wikipedia nothing fancy here but

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
important thing so which you wanted to

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
you to high understand here is

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,120
few things these are algorithms that

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
improve automatically all

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
through experience i'll talk about that

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,959
this is a subset of artificial

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
intelligence

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,440
these are there when you know i mean

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
this particularly our models are

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
so algorithms where you are predicting

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,640
something without being explicitly

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
programmed

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
i'll talk about that that's an important

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
thing which you need to be understanding

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
about machine learning

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
and it is also somewhere it's it's if

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
you

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
apply machine learning when difficult

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
when when you have solutions or when you

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
have

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,840
tasks where it's infeasible or difficult

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
to develop

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,040
conv conventional algorithms for the

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
requirements you have at place

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,680
so very important these points which we

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
will be keeping on talking as we go in

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,440
the session further

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,200
but try to let memorize these because i

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,280
think this this will help us aid in our

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,680
discussion

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,519
now on a high level artificial

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,360
intelligence is something where it talks

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
about or learns about all the programs

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
that learn and reasons like human beings

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
machine learning is a small subset

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,519
within that where we are

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,599
talking about studying algorithms which

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
can which can learn by itself

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
without being explicitly programmed deep

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
learning is again

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
based on a concept called artificial

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
neural networks

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,480
that learn and adapt from vast data

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
so uh this this this is a big picture of

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,440
what machine learning

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,040
difference differentiates itself from

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
art of insurance and deep learning how

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,440
it is associated

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
now quick question to you all i know i

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
cannot

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120
uh see your chat but a quick question to

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,319
you all is how do you learn your native

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
language

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,640
when we were born we typically have two

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,599
options to learn your native language

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,799
you i give you a dictionary you learn it

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,480
i give you like

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,360
all the dictionaries and usage and

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,360
grammar and ask you to learn it

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
the second one which typical i mean this

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
this will never work

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,319
even if you try to learn it it takes

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
years and years because that's not how

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
we are adapted

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,239
now how we are adapted as human beings

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,959
we typically learn by

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,600
examples your mom teaches you saying

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,359
that hey

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
this is how the word looks like this is

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,360
how uh rhymes

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,160
are there and we we are trying to be

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
adapt to more and more examples as we go

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
now imagine same goes with any pictorial

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
representation

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
you see an animal with long nose and

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
ears

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
and a tail and your mom when you're a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,040
kid

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,240
tells you that hey that's a dog you

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
understand that's a dog

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
you know how do you you kind of have

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,720
your

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,320
brain which you know creates a memory of

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,000
what dogs look like

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,919
and imagine the next day a fox comes

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,919
and you try to touch it your mom will

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
say i mean she slaps you and say hey

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,560
that's a fox

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
that's not a dog but you try to

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
understand what's different

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
what is this nuance between talk and a

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
fox it has

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,199
obviously the same kind of nose ears and

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
for

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,720
tail the teeth might be different so

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
what you're trying to do is you're

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,320
trying to reduce the error in your brain

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,360
to identify a dog versus fox

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,240
so all of what you do in your life

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
is to reduce that errors what is the

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
truth

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
how i can go with that with the data

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,560
available

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
and your brain is actually processed or

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
created

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
in such a way that it takes the memory

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
footprint and try to reduce the errors

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
as we go further

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,479
now that's exactly what we do mostly

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
that's the kind of thought process

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,440
which goes into machine learning by the

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,280
way this session is more intended on

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
the strategy of employing your machine

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,240
learning not in details about what is

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
exactly amal

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
because i think that's a discussion for

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,319
another

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
now if you look at and employ that same

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
logic

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,639
to a common problem which you always

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,960
face

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,759
explicitly writing programs to

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
understand

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,240
a male contains is a spam or not you can

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,840
raise if those conditions there is

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
nothing wrong here if you look at

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
this referrals condition is perfectly

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
valid you are not doing anything wrong

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
but the point is

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
if you keep on doing this all of us will

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,800
get mail next day because

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
there is no way you can actually capture

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,759
all the

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,000
spam logic or the requirements

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
in an if else condition even though you

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
tried a conventional program doesn't

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
work

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
now what is an alternative and best

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
approach to do that

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
maybe if you think out of box the best

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,520
other alternative approach

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,600
is going and understanding hey let's

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,280
classify some emails

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
and change oneself basically what i'm

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
doing is

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
and try to reduce the errors when we are

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
trying to classify

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
and we keep on repeating that until that

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
the reduce the error

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
rate is within a limit which is

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,800
adaptable which is

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,120
okay to actually use that so this is how

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,479
we kind of think in machine learning

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
language or

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,759
that's a mindset of an ml developer

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
where if he says

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
this is how traditional programming

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
looks like and

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,759
how it differentiates to machine

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,319
learning here

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,919
now quick differentiation if you are in

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
a company a large scale company you will

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
see this more often

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,639
beyond reporting is more descriptive in

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
nature machine learning is more

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,080
predictive in nature

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
when it talks about sophistication

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
obviously there is a lot more

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
sophisticated that

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
which which you are going to do in

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,479
machine learning

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
now let's quickly jump and understand

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
the power

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
and what it takes to be now this is a

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,800
research paper

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,639
where the bunch of research scientists

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,639
played atari you know atari game this is

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
based on like deep learning scientists

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
actually started playing

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,360
you know training or playing atari games

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
using reinforcement learning

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
so if you look at i mean this this

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
wrapper is online you can actually

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
search for it but what we're going to

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,000
talk about is

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
how impactful is machine learning or

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
what is the use cases that are trying to

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
solve

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
you might have all seen this game this

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,639
is atari breakout game

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,720
now what it does is if you the

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
the the research paper talks about a

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,120
situation where

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
the pixels on the screen are given as an

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,680
input

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
and the paddle on the down is something

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
which is predicted the position of the

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
paddle

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,760
is predicted as part of

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,440
how the game is actually being played

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
now it's a combination of conventional

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
neural network

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,080
trained with a variant of q learning and

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,839
obviously

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
it's more of a reinforcement learning

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,399
and conventional network which is at

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
play here

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
now the whole point is can the paddle

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
the down paddle

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,720
be accurately placed are

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
you know kind of actually predicted the

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
way the paddle goes

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,080
if you keep on actually giving input as

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
the screen here the pixel as a screen

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
here

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,240
now with 10 minutes what the observed is

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,279
it's a random lag

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
always the paddle fails with no signs of

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,600
intelligence

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,160
and as in when it is playing with itself

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
in 120 minutes a flawless play started

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
it's actually

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,959
competing like as if a normal human

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,000
being is playing here now

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,880
the next level to this is

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,680
with 240 minutes a strategy emerged the

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
strategy here is if we break up the ball

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
if the ball

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,440
break ups the wall the corner of a wall

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
the game is over it actually breaks up

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,959
everything this is a strategy

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,399
which was not there before like point in

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,519
time this strategy was

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,760
unknown and it was uncovered when

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
the variations of this game is being

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,320
played by

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
a combination of conventional neural

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,360
networks and reinforcement learning

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
now the whole point here is i mean

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
obviously they started playing all the

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,720
games

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
and tried and saw that it's the

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
reinforcement learning is much

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
more accurate and it's being actually

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,320
performing above human

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,440
level so it kind of bring to your point

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,360
that all these

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,040
models or machine learning is going to

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
give you an advantage

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,360
or uncovers something in your programs

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
which are in your solution

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,880
which is something which you never have

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
thought of or known before

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,720
now to suffice what we are doing is

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,880
we're solving problems without knowing

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
how explicitly creating a solution for

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
it

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
now there are so many use cases to this

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,160
i don't want to go deep dive into all

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
these use cases but yes there is a

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,320
section of use cases where machine

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,120
learning can be applied

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,079
now how it is different from being an

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,160
animal software

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
this is where things i wanted to like

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,480
talk about and take my time here

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,680
this very important topic of discussion

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,800
imagine

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,920
you're a person who wanted to

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,680
go for a coffee take a coffee like you

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,160
go and search in your application

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
coffee shop near me or you wanted to

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,519
decide

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,720
which coffee shop is near to you there

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,720
are two coffee shops

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
three minutes walking you get coffee

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
shop eggs

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
five minutes walking you get coffee shop

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,399
why

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
which one you choose or if i am an

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
application if i wanted to give you a

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
search result or if i wanted to give you

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
an application which suggest you which

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,640
coffee shop you need to go

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,920
how would i do it there are so many

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
variations here

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
is the quality of coffee shop x is

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,120
better than y

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,079
or is it like you need coffee shop white

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
i mean your regular

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,959
coffee shop why if it is five minutes

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,360
walk you can actually bear with it

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,880
or imagine a situation where you have a

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
bridge in between coffee shop

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,399
y and you but you love coffee shop why

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,800
do you really wanted to go there these

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,760
are all hard problems to solve

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
how would you decide which one to go for

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,639
now

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
the solution to this is instead of you

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,800
being judgmental and saying that hey

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,639
this guy might like actually coffee shop

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
why because he's been there for a long

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
time

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
because the bridge is actually a barrier

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,079
he cannot walk so instead of you

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
concluding this

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,079
maybe the best option for you is to

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,399
start with

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
understanding imagine let's take office

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
of x

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,720
how does his experience change with

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,399
the distance if he's always trying to go

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
for x

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,639
this is how you need to first of all

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,000
understand the data

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,680
how his experience with x

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,880
changes with the distance based on how

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,279
he traveled

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,160
now all you just need to is take all the

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
data

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
put it on a diagram put it on a graph

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
you're not doing anything here all

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,639
you're just doing is

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
mark how his experience how user

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
happiness here

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
is changing with respect to time the

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
distance is traveling

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,000
when he wanted to travel to coffee shop

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,279
x now once you plot this diagram

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,200
or graph all you see is you see a

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,839
pattern emerging here

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,839
if you keenly observe the pack the

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,160
pattern here

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:27,519
is you are trying to be in a place where

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,880
coffee shop x is if you're traveling a

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,360
lot of distance

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
it clearly indicates that you are

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,240
actually

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:40,160
not happy now if you look at

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,160
this situation and this situation

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,320
you your user happiness is not improved

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,639
even though the distance is less

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,240
so how do you do it now the best way you

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,000
can actually try doing it

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,279
is draw a straight line

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,480
can be one of the options the trend is

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,120
if you draw a straight line and observe

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
and you can find out a pattern of how

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
his

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
user happiness is actually being trained

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
if you reduce the time

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
that the distance your happiness is

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
increasing

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,279
which is perfectly fine but there are

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
scenarios where which are

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
off the graph there is so much it's it's

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,839
actually giving you so much error

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
which means there will be some scenarios

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
which

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,720
cannot be predicted but that prediction

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,440
will give you us a very big error which

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
impact your experience in the product so

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,240
your job

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
is yes you found out your pattern but

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,360
how do you reduce this error

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,760
now if you understand like calculus and

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
and mathematics this is more of a linear

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
model

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,639
the problem with this model is it's too

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,519
rigid or underfitting because

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
the error here is obviously very high

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,360
now

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,639
maybe if i'm being you know little smart

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,720
and try to create or build up a graph

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,120
which is connecting everything like it's

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,040
a curvy line which is almost connecting

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,199
what you're trying doing here is you're

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,079
trusting the data too much

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
you're exactly saying this guy actually

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,720
is

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,639
not happy when the distance is three

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
kilometers it it doesn't look that way

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
there is no pattern here

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,760
in this case it's actually too flexible

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
or over 15.

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,000
now what would be the right solution

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
maybe if you draw a smooth line

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,440
the distance or the curve between these

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
two kind of actually

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
is is readily increased or as we go

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
further the

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,680
experience obviously drops down but the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,839
experience is quite high if the distance

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,920
is quite small

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,120
so this is kind of a good learning which

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,160
you wanted to have

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,040
in your product like what we did

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,839
we understood the user data and

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
translated

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,079
that data to a graph or

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
understood the data found out a pattern

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
which is what something we are missing

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,759
or we didn't know that

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,560
and tried to come up with is a pattern

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,320
which might

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,639
look like what is that going to look

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,120
like in future or what is the

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,639
path which we need to take if i wanted

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,880
to give him most

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,240
user happiness so this is how a typical

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
machine learning scientist would

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
actually think when he's building any

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,959
product

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,480
now few learnings out of it the first

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,000
learning obviously

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,000
it's smooth monotonic respects examples

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,279
it should not be quite linear but doing

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
all the right things

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,560
machine learning is all about good

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
parenting so if the data is wrong

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,240
obviously your data output is wrong

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
if you are giving bad examples you get

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
bad examples out

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
and i mean it's garbage and garbage out

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
and if you give the right examples and

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
flexibility you will get the right model

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
out of it

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,759
so three things important which in in

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
machine learning is obviously data

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,320
algorithm and insights

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,160
now let's talk about managers by the way

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,800
i'm gonna show you quite

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,399
two of demos as we go further uh i'll

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
take your questions i cannot see what

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,519
questions are being asked but i'll take

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,839
questions as soon as i switch to demos

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,640
i'll have some time there

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,120
now let's talk about mindset with what

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
kind of mindset as a manager or a cx or

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,400
a product manager

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
you need to have while you are

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,919
incorporating machine learning into your

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
models or in your product

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,280
the first one i would definitely talk

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,079
about

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,880
is oh there are so many to cover by the

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,640
way i

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
i'll go one by one i'll take you through

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,280
all of them and i'll pause after this

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,880
two slides and then take some questions

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
the first one is obviously don't be

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,760
afraid to launch your product without

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
machine learning

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,039
by the way the first one i'll give you

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
an example

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,080
when i wanted to build an ecommerce

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,240
website and

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
when i wanted to show recommendations

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
for products you wanted to buy

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,080
or search i mean list out all the

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,480
products based on your preference

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,080
on the day one i don't need to really do

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
machine learning all i just need to use

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,000
maybe

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
try to do an alphabetical order of

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,799
showing listing out all the products

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
simple i'm not trying to be fancy i'm

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,600
just putting alphabetical order

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
like for example i'm building a

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,440
streaming service like netflix

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,760
i just put the most viewed

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
videos on the home page i don't really

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
customize that on the day one

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,200
so don't be afraid of launching your

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
product but one thing which you need to

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,799
be very sure is

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
you need to identify which are the

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
problems

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,200
customized for machine learning which

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
you cannot use

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
traditional programming methods the best

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,160
example i would say

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,799
is what is the view time if you are

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
building

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,520
some portal like netflix a streaming

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,320
portal the view time or what is the next

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,320
video you need to promote or show to

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,440
make sure that or the user continuously

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
watches it

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,760
that's a problem which is not something

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,640
traditional programming models can solve

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
so you need to have that idea of list of

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
problems

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
on the day one to understand and use

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,320
machine learning models well

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,919
the reason you need to take

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,160
those inputs to kind of build heuristics

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,919
into your application so your

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,039
application has to be properly

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,039
ha you know kind create logs

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,640
and heuristics which are destined and

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
designed to make sure that

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,960
you are you you have the solution to

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,200
your problem as we go further

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,039
now the third thing is it's not just

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,039
about predictions

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,200
you're not trying to say okay this this

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,559
might be a probable

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,720
video which the person choose to see

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
that's not how it looks like you need to

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
aim for a decision

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,919
yes i understand i wanted to bring out

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,240
the video

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
or about you know which video wanted to

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
watch but what is that i'm gonna do with

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
that

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,679
maybe i'll build a recommendation bar

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
and such as that on the top of the list

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
or maybe i'll actually make that

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,520
clickable on to the video link

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
so there are decisions which actually

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
impact

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
here rather than the predictions which

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,840
obviously are there

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,799
which you wanted to achieve the next one

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
is

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,440
choose machine learning when there is a

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,360
complex and unmaintainable heuristic

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,760
for example popularity of a product

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,000
launched is combinational complex

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,240
or popularity of any new movie coming

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
out is always complex

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,960
now look into those areas where you have

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,000
unmanageable and complex heuristics

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,919
to choose machine learning now the next

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
important the fifth point obviously

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,320
where you need to focus on

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,679
is you don't need to always worry about

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
the data

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,120
i'll give you an example for that in a

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,400
while but the point is you don't need to

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,240
worry for the data

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
there are so many internal and external

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
data sources within your own

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
infrastructure

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,760
your team logs your click stream data

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,360
your product logs your customer

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,200
interaction data which you actually

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
understand from a lot of application

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,480
logs

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,080
all that will aid your application those

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
are the input talk

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,600
and very important you need to also get

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,440
your infrastructure right to make sure

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
that all the logs are collected

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
from the day one if your infrastructure

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
to

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,480
manage this in machine learning models

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,640
is not right

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
it's going to be a problem as we go

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
further and build

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,600
bigger and bigger models which requires

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,120
petabytes of data

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
now having just merely the data is not

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,640
import not not

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
not the end of it you need to transform

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,240
that filter that

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
and and there is a saying that the data

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
is beyond six months or seven months i

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
think the data is not useful anymore

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,840
so you have to have a real-time

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
processing engine in your own

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,640
application

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,640
which kind of transforms this data and

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,240
normalize massage this with existing

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,559
external data sources

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
and make sure that the data is ready so

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
by the way there are outside data

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,480
sources in a lot of open source data

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
sources

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,039
uh in in in kaggle and other external

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,400
sources where you can take advantage of

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:54,080
it for example if you wanted to

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,159
imagine uh understand which

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,919
place uh yeah bit by the way bitcoin

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,720
entire transactional data is out in the

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,200
market

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,080
it's it's it's public now what you can

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,000
also do with that

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,559
is i'm just throwing an idea out is take

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,039
the data put it into a data source or a

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,799
warehouse search it and understand what

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,760
is the first ever transaction recorded

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,919
in bitcoin

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,520
how much transactions are happening and

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,520
what is the areas of

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,360
uh transactions which people are using

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
bitcoin for maybe

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,960
launch your application in those areas

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
to make sure that you take advantage of

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,080
it

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,919
one of the use cases or when you say i

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
wanted to hire a person who is very good

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
at java

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,960
now where do you find good java people

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,720
with good java experience

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
maybe stack overflow data is actually

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,799
out in public take that

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
and understand just search for it and

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,159
see

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
where from which place i mean i'm just

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
throwing it out

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,520
you know massage that data with external

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,600
ip data and see where

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
in which areas people are actually

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
answering a lot of java questions

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and and go to that area and do your

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
hiring and if you wanted to use any open

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
source

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
application in your project which

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,880
application

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,320
obviously is most reliable which has

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,559
more contributors

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,679
search on github data github data gives

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,360
you insights

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,360
on which is has more contributors

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,280
obviously kubernetes has today

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,039
a lot more contributors so you can you

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,520
can get all these insights

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,200
from external data sources which can be

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
combined with your existing data or

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
resources

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,919
so build your data model in the initial

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,080
days to make sure that

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
you're taking advantage of all these

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
insights which you are

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,520
never thought of and you have to have a

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,880
baseline heuristic so baseline

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,480
heuristics is

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
directly dependent on what kind of

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,960
problems you're trying to solve

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
now when you launch on the launch date

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
make sure that you implement all the

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,159
metrics in your product

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,000
you should you should have your login

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
for example in this case i wanted to say

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
which video user watch next

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,600
you should be able to understand the

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,520
watch time and the video content

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,279
classification of these videos

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
all that has to be implemented in your

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,159
product to get that

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,159
experience into into your data source

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,559
so i'll just pause here maybe take a

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,559
question if you have any

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,559
uh i'll just check questions once

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,840
excellent looks like uh there is no

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,840
question like let me continue

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,799
so second one is once you have your

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,600
application ready and open

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,440
identify the predictive power so what is

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,080
the predictive power here means

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,799
i'll give you a small example i started

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
a company

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,039
a startup and you also started a startup

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,559
now tell me

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
both of us are in a business of

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
predicting which horse will win in a

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,919
horse race

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,039
now why do an investor invest in me

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,720
versus you

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
or why should a company actually give me

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,640
an offer versus you

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,720
now the point is there are so many

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
examples to this i can say you can say i

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,760
have the

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,039
latest data available you can say i have

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
the

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,720
old data available i have the best

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,559
resources available the point is all

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
these variables can be changed for

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
example you have the best resource maybe

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
i can

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,559
he can actually join my company or you

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
have the best data

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,000
you can i can also acquire the data or

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
procure the data or find

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
some ways to actually get the live

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,760
stream data out of it so

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,520
all the things which make predicting a

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,000
horse race win

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,799
always are interchangeable like you can

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
always

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,640
be a point where i have a lead sometimes

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
and you have a lead

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
now what changes the entire outcome

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
imagine

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
i went to a stanford or a premier

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,960
university

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:43,679
fund a research and found out that

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:47,200
eye of a horse the the water on the eye

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,320
of a horse is actually it can give me a

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,320
better insight on the

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,520
horse health and the stamina of the

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,919
horse

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,559
that's something which you might not

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,760
have

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,640
that is a feature which you might not be

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,039
even knowing

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,799
so if i include that feature maybe my

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,200
advantage is i have better

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,120
options to get more details out of it or

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,760
more more predictability out of it

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,200
so identify the product predictive power

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,440
with the features

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,520
in your product i'm going to show you a

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,400
demo of these features on how they

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,080
impact

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
the way the prediction actually changes

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,600
and works

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,080
now once you have the features ready

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,240
you need to be having an ideal outcome

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,400
what is your ideal outcome

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,679
you need to be answering you should be

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
knowing that

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,919
my ideal outcome is the hearts win or at

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
least the third one two three top three

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,320
horses

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,200
or the time limit so you need to have

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,120
some ideal outcome to test it beforehand

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,240
and you need to also have a success and

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
failure metrics

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,320
of the model if it is performing good or

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,320
not sometimes whatever it comes out of

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,000
machine learning looks good

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,520
because that is something you trusted

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
and you don't know what it is but you

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,720
should be having some test

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:02,000
validations like for example

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,159
someone need to say i always

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
encounter this problem where you talk

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,360
about

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,520
how the pricing has to be changing like

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,799
the the variable pricing for

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,720
uh cabs so how do i charge a customer

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
in the morning to evening so there

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,240
should be some validation where

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,240
people already knowing that would be

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,000
able to validate your pricing

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,760
beforehand to make sure that whatever

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,679
you're doing is right or wrong

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,960
so you have some failure metrics and

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
success metrics

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,440
how for your model beforehand and that's

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,840
like the next one is

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,440
have good output which is directly

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,960
connected to your outcome

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,240
so make sure that you're taking

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
decisions and the decisions are

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,679
impacting

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
how it is uh how your input is being

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,559
accessed

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
and last few steps are very very

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,960
important don't

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,720
i would say bias is the biggest enemy of

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
machine learning

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,080
and and and people are combating that

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
like every day

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
so make sure that you don't trust

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,399
machine learning as on the face value of

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,640
it

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,080
have humans in a loop make sure that you

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,720
are validating your model

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,559
every day make sure that there is a

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,039
validation in checks where humans

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,640
decide some of the gates where the major

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
learning is performing in the right way

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,679
or not

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,840
for example you might all see where you

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,520
will see a thumbs up on the thumbs down

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,360
for every suggestion you get in

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,039
for machine learning whether you like

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,360
the solution or not so you're taking a

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,679
constant feedback here from the audience

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,120
or the users or the humans and

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,480
understanding and readjusting your

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,600
machine learning

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
machine learning is all about

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,760
experimentation it doesn't stop as and

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
when you build a model

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,440
it's evolving as if we humans are

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,840
evolving in terms of learning something

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,039
new

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,159
every day now freshness of the system is

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,399
paramount important and uh the reason

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
if it is a old data which changes like a

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,279
decade data which is changing the way

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
your narrative is

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,120
there is no point in having that in your

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
system and using information learning so

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,159
understand what is the freshness of your

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,399
requirements

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
and play with that play with that data

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,919
wrong

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,120
and and obviously last three steps are

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,440
mostly for testing

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,159
make sure that you export data i mean

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
test the

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,360
models before exporting remember that

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,360
you are not the typical end user

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,760
always have a third eye or a third

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,679
person or an agency testing your models

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,360
thoroughly as if a third person because

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
all these biases are the main problems

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,720
of your product not performing well

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
i always plan to launch a night rate

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,360
continuously as we go

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,200
further so just to summarize

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,480
first of all don't be afraid of

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,440
launching a product without

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,159
ml solve understand your problem very

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,480
very well

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,080
identify your data sources there is

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,960
enough data already available in the

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,919
market

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
take advantage of that build heuristics

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,360
launch

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,559
and look into your team information team

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,240
logs a lot

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,640
uh instead of worrying about finding

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,640
data outside for your problem statement

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,279
design your product with all the metrics

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,679
to be embedded into that on the day one

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,200
and create some decision making process

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,480
for the predictions which machine

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,120
learning create

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,399
identify the predictive power with

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,880
features

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
and obviously test the model very very

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
well

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
before you even validate it and have

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,840
your ideal outcome

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
beforehand understand there is always a

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
bias which

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,960
goes into your models have humans in

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,840
loop maintain the freshness of the

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,679
system

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,880
launch and iterate the product

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,960
continuously

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
and typically test it as you are the

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,760
third

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,960
in the way that you are not the only

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,960
person testing the system

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
this is what i always say machine

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,399
learning is

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,799
a prop it's not the entire product

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,960
if you look at the cake i buy that cake

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,760
for the icing on the cake or the design

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,480
on the cake

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,679
but i will eat that cake only if it is

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
actually tasty

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,720
the repetition value of that is if the

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,120
taste cake is actually baked properly or

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,840
it tastes properly so your machine

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,559
learning will

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,760
make people to buy that but it's it's

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,039
not something which

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,679
is defining your entire product treat it

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,000
that way

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
and make sure that it is just a prop and

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
make sure that your project or your

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,720
product has paramount important

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,480
and obviously to create that edge of

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,840
your product over others

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
machine learning has a lot of value

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
so let me take you through a

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,080
practicality of how we've designed this

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,840
or or how features actually changes or

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,840
creates a change within your company

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
so

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,640
i'll be monitoring question and answers

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
if you have any questions

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,399
but do let me know if you have any now

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,399
let's take

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,760
a problem statement where i wanted to

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,799
show you

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,120
a model where you wanted to identify

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,919
with all the pictures

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,440
whether you have a picture i mean you

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,679
have a ton of pictures

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,720
i wanted to understand which pictures

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,880
has

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,480
uh which pictures are bizarre or not

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,320
what are what are the pictures of pizza

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,600
here or what are not

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,880
now the first thing is i split my entire

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,640
data into like 80

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,240
for training and obviously 20 for

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,480
testing as we said

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,799
we are going to use for testing now when

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,360
you train the model typically

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,399
imagine you take a feature which is

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
which you think of

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,799
out of box the features can be like it

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,880
can be baked it has meat

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,039
it has it is cooked in pan for example i

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
took features where it has

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,799
anything with red sauce cooked in pan is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,240
going to be a pizza

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,919
imagine and i want training

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,279
the data for 92 percent training

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,000
accuracy

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,200
and let's see how it actually works in

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,159
the test

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,760
so if you look at that kind of model

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,440
gives me like 75 percent

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,919
data accuracy so why it is not accurate

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
here what i'll actually try and tell you

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,279
is

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,440
splitting you can choose to split i

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,279
would typically go for 80 20 always

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,679
but you can choose the training data and

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,320
testing data also changes the way

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,279
the model actually behave now once this

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,679
is what i wanted

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,600
you to understand very clearly is if you

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,000
look at the features

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,760
so what we said is anything red sauce

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,039
and a cooking

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,840
in a pan is going to be a good dessert

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,960
but that's not the case always maybe

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,120
think

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,240
creatively here where you wanted to say

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,760
hey

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,039
i wanted to define carbs and anything

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,720
which is round have

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,799
a lot of carbs maybe can be a pizza

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,279
nothing wrong in that for example what

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,919
i'm saying is i'm selecting carbs

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,760
and round as my features in my model

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,679
why i'm doing that because i thought

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,720
this it would be the right solution to

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,840
have

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,000
uh to be incorporated in my uh

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,200
model which which is nothing wrong so

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,240
let's see how

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,000
this goes when you test this

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,960
okay and if you look at there is a lot

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,359
of improvement

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,639
in the data accuracy so what i'm trying

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,960
to say is

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,960
the images are the same the training

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,000
data set is also the same the split is

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,240
all the same

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
but what changes here is the features

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,560
which you select

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
that the predictive power which you

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,240
bring on to the table i think this is

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,480
the takeaway for this is

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,520
you need to always think of how you can

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,480
bring in

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,000
the the features into consideration to

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
make sure that the models are accurate

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,079
and it's a thumb rule this is what i

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,960
learned over a period

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,200
anything you write rules for you can use

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,119
machine learning mostly

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,960
typically if you are very very new to ml

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
and wanted to try understand where your

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
problems can be solved

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,680
this is the place where you can start

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,200
with

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,079
now one ml is not a super ml

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,440
for example you wanted to have a stock

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,200
uh uh what is the stock on the

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
supermarket how many models you might

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,280
need there is a combination of models

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,280
here

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
you're not trying to use one api or one

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
model to predict everything that's not

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,560
how it works

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,480
for example you wanted to see what what

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,000
stock goes out in the supermarket

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,200
you need to know the demand you know to

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,520
the inventory you need to have

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
restocking time etc etc so you need to

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
predict

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,760
a lot of stuff and then actually use

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,720
these predictions as a chain of events

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,079
to create this impact of what is that

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
model look like

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,079
so never think of that that there is one

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,320
solution to this

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,320
now

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
here is what i want to take you through

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,640
this is where i wanted to be more

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,960
interactive

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,240
as you can actually chat take time to

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,839
chat

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,359
let's see this is a question for you all

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,160
who are learning here

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
let's say you're a meteorologist so what

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
you

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
what what the problem statement i give

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,320
you is

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,440
i want you to predict whether trends on

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,440
flight plans for example i wanted to

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,119
see simple case i wanted to see if my

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,079
flight is actually taking off

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,119
whether it goes into turbulence or not

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,119
how would you do it

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,400
go ahead and chat if you have a quick

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,760
i'll give you just

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,040
30 seconds how do you solve this problem

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,280
where

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,800
i want you to predict if my flight

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,480
actually is taking off

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,480
will be going into turbulence or not

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
anyone

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,000
okay looks like no one but i'll try to

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,040
answer that maybe

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,839
a chat if you have any kind of answers

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,160
for this

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,000
but there are different ways to solve

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,400
this one of the best ways

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,320
obviously is to collect a lot of weather

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,680
data predict that i mean that's a good

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
way it's nothing wrong

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,320
but here machine learning is all about

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,079
experimentation finding the parameters

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,440
which are unique and different which

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,800
your competitors

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,960
doesn't have now how do you do it maybe

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,079
i'll go back to the basics where i'll

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,720
tell you

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,320
there are different types of clouds

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,119
called cumulative numbers

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
seras there are 10 to 10 plus different

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,920
types of clouds

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,839
for example kimberly numbers is

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,240
associated with hurricanes

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,200
it is a dense cloud whereas serous is

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,040
more of

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,800
open cloud so there are as a

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,880
meteorologist what i will do is i know

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,520
there are different types of clouds

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,079
and there is open data sets out in the

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,280
market

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,280
which gives me the cloud data like the

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,320
cloud images

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,040
now what i do with this image maybe

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
those can be

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
my data sources yeah that's a great

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
answer

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,240
input weather flight patterns uh

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,599
historical data wind patterns all of

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,160
them are right exactly

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,599
compare existing wind data yeah i mean

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
come on keep on getting

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,800
keep keep coming with more and more

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
answers yes these are all

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,800
excellent uh uh different ways of

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,440
actually solving the same problem

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,280
now i i'll give you my suggestion one

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
one thing which i thought will be useful

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,599
is

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,440
maybe i'm a no wise guy i don't know

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,320
machine learning i start with actually

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
the data

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
images of different types of clouds and

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,800
why not use them

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,720
which are public open now what i do is

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,160
imagine this is criminal numbers and

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,839
this is serious

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,599
but if i go to cumulative numbers i'm

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,119
going to have a very tough time it's

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,400
going to be a turbulent

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,599
now i can say this as i'm as a weather

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,599
guy but

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,200
imagine if i give it to any commercial

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,680
api

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,480
this is what it gives you it just says

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,119
cloud

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,119
daytime blue atmosphere so the

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,320
commercial apis are not designed for

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,760
your use case

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,520
by the way always look at if there is

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,079
any api already in open

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,599
uh 80 of the times i have seen startups

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,119
and products and companies trying to

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,880
reinvent the wheel

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,240
try if there is the approach which i

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,760
generally take is put it into a

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,119
commercial api and see if there is an

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,240
answer coming out

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,359
no here in this case i don't have maybe

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,079
the best option is

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,280
i'll try to use services outside in the

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,760
market

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,440
uh maybe let's build a prototype so i

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,359
used one service from google

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,880
you can choose to use any other service

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,960
according to your choice

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,000
one service which typically i used is

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,839
called auto mla

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ai it's more of a autopilot mode

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,520
or a service which can do multi-label

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,040
classification with

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,000
no coding experience thank you so what i

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,960
did is i

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
imported all these images which are

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,240
public

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,040
put it into this service i tried

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,359
labeling them

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,200
into different types of clouds here if

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,560
you see auto criminals to auto status

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,520
there are excluding numbers

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,280
i trying to do that and what i did is i

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
just clicked the new train model

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,480
i can say i wanted to download this

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
continue

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,160
i can say for higher accuracy or better

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,400
trade-off i'm okay

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,400
i'll set a node budget which is like how

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,680
many time how many hours it can try and

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,119
start training

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,760
so once i do this i'll get a model like

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,760
this

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,280
where i can see the average precision or

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,200
i can see the evaluation

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,400
how it is doing what is the confusion

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,240
matrix uh

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,240
you know what kind of precision and

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,720
recall are there so for every model i

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,240
have

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,000
to build it with different uh taggings

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,440
i'll see a different pattern so i'll

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,640
take one of them

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,680
and deploy that and maybe

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,640
upload image and see what kind of cloud

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,760
it looks like oh this is clearly numbers

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,480
i have a model ready now i can download

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
this

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,960
put it into a machine like or a

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,440
uh or a small hardware

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,079
which can take a picture which sits in

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
the flight

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,480
which which sits where the flight is

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,680
taking off take pictures of the clouds

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,000
and immediately say what is the

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,640
probability of that flight getting into

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,160
turbulence

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,240
in the cloud as in the flight is taking

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,880
off this is one way of

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,920
many ways you can think of now this is

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,240
easy to develop

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,000
easy to build and maybe i can actually

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,440
quickly iterate it to market and give to

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,880
a poc

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
rather than worrying about a lot of data

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,400
which is outside the market

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,400
this is one way of doing that i mean

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
this is not the only way to solve it

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,880
but obviously out of 100 different ways

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,760
this can be a good way to start

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,880
so this is where i i would love to have

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,440
my company

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,040
to see if the validation is done and i

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,560
know the cloud data here i am a

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,920
meteorologist i know how to test the

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,160
validate the data

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,640
and i learn this from there and i try to

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,880
tag or get better quality images

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,400
tag them properly and give them training

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,440
one more time to see how the precision

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,440
is improving

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,599
so i can reiterate multiple times when

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,960
if whenever i'm actually growing big and

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,960
i have enough funding

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,119
in my product then i can actually

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,640
include all what you said like forecast

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,960
heat change

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,960
historical wind patterns and and their

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,800
radar delays current radar

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,800
all that information we i'll keep on

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,640
collecting as in when i know that this

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,119
is going to be successful so it's like

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,640
start small grow big i trade multiple

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,720
times until you get a better model out

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,839
of it

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,280
now uh five minutes yeah now

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,839
let's final uh a word

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,800
for for me is in your organization

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,400
always maintain high quality data sets

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,160
better have your infrastructure ready

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,280
for machine learning have a lot of

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
compute

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,040
make sure that you have powerful tools

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,119
at your disposal

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,359
default everything open in your company

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,359
your company should not actually have

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,440
hold silos of information within each

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,520
other be productive have governance

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,280
nothing wrong in that but at least make

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,720
sure that people know different types of

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,440
data is available within your own

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,359
company

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,680
the reason is your employees does you

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,880
never know how employees come up with

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,400
huge values value sets out of your data

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,640
if they know what kind of data is

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,960
available in your company so create that

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,880
model where everything is shareable

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,680
within your company and create that

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,359
uh create that experience to employees

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,319
that this is the kind of data available

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,000
and see how

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,240
beautiful different applications they

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,160
come up with

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,520
set up principles of air in your org

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,520
never take it for granted

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,720
ai comes with is an advanced technology

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,640
it empowers people

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,040
but it also comes with a lot of issues

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,920
of bias safety accountability privacy

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,319
so make sure that you have a principle

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,640
in your organization to safeguard this

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,400
do a valid mandatory audit checks

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,440
continuously in your organization make

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,960
sure that you are

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,079
you're doing it in the right way for

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,599
next generations to use your products

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,520
and yeah i think i'm just out of time

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:55,280
and thank you very much for listening to

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,280
