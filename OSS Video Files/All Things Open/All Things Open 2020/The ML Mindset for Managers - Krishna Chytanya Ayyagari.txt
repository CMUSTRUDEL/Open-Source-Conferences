Machine Learning should supplement the product in the right way. In this session, we will discuss on (1) how a machine learning mindset differs from traditional software development mindset, (2) when and how managers (product managers or C-level executives) need to think of Machine Learning in their products, (3) how managers need to plan for Machine Learning in their products & (4) where to invest to achieve desired results with Machine Learning in their products. If you are a C-level executive or a product manager looking to understand and validate ML requirements in your products, this session is for you.
