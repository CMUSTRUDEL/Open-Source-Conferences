	Presented by: Matt Asay, Amazon Web Services
Presented at All Things Open 2020

Abstract: It’s 2020 and some open source companies keep fighting one of the best things to have happened to open source: cloud computing. This is a mistake, but it’s not one we need to keep repeating. In this talk I’ll dig into what's happening in open source licensing and strategies and how cloud will shape (and improve) our open source future.

	00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,719
so i'm first of all

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,200
very grateful for todd i have i think it

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,800
might have been 2007 was my first year

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,240
uh presenting at what was then called uh

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,720
poscon and has since become all things

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
open

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
todd has been very gracious in the past

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,960
of asking for my

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
uh my opinion on things as to what he

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
should do to make this event even better

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
and

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
fortunately he has not heeded any of my

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,559
suggestions which is why

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,000
all things open is as fantastic as it is

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,480
today and he's just done an amazing job

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,719
i want to talk a little bit and

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,960
appreciate todd and the

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
other speakers that we've had so far i

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
want to talk a little bit about

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
open source in the cloud which has been

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,079
a

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
contentious issue in the in the past

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,440
but in the spirit of the people who have

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
already spoken i don't want to talk

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,520
about it from a contentious angle

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
i want to talk about it in the spirit of

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
partnership

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
but i'm going to start with something

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,040
that might sound a little contentious

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
and that is

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
in a conversation that i had not too

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
long ago with a colleague of mine matt

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,799
wilson

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,320
he made the observation that most

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
enterprise software

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,240
is garbage he might not have used the

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,479
word garbage but he said

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,960
we talked about why enterprise software

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,240
is so incredibly bad

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880
and his suggestion was that the reason

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,119
for that

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
ultimately comes down to the fact that

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
the vendors of the software are not the

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,799
ultimate users of the software

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
and the closer we could get and this

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,240
goes back to something that

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,720
uh now ibm president then uh red hat ceo

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
jim whitehurst said back in 2009 which

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,399
was

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,759
we have so much waste in in the software

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
industry

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,200
we really need end users there's not a

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
great

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
word for that but let's say end users or

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
customers

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
also not a great way of expressing it

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,679
but end users of software we need

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,360
more end users of software contributing

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
to open source so that instead of

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
reinventing the wheel

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,280
we can collaborate so that's what i want

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,720
to talk about today i want to talk about

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,920
how we get there

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,959
and how we bring down the wall between

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,400
open source and cloud

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,840
because there's been this myth that's

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
surfaced over the last few years and

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
that is that

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,200
in some way cloud and open source

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,239
are in contention are in conflict

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,160
and i would argue the opposite is true

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,040
uh recently in a new stack series

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
that that i wrote and i got so much

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
great feedback from people

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
on twitter and uh and quote unquote in

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
real life

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,440
that said the cloud would not be

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
possible without open source

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
and i think that's true i think it might

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,159
have been erica who started this

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
day off who said it really i mean part

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
of it comes down to economics but it's

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,280
not

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,640
really a matter of economics it's really

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
a matter of how

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
how would you count up all the licenses

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,920
if you're thinking of

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,840
thousands or tens of thousands or

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
millions of servers

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
how do you do that with open source you

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,840
don't really have to think about that

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
with traditional enterprise software

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,720
proprietary software

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,440
you did and it makes it such that

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
the cloud would be if not impossible and

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
i would argue impossible

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,200
least extraordinarily difficult and

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,400
chris de bona who i think is speaking

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
tomorrow

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
made that contention years ago that

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
google would not be possible without

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
open source

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,200
so we know that the cloud enables or

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,120
that open source enables the cloud but i

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,239
want to talk a little bit about how

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,080
the cloud is enabling open source

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,439
so and and as part of that a good friend

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
of mine sam ramji

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
who's now chief strategy officer at

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,040
datastax

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,799
used to be the open source guy back when

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,480
that was a thing at microsoft but that

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,840
was a long time ago

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,040
now open source is everybody's thing

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,160
at microsoft sams

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,919
likes to say if you want to go fast go

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
alone

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,000
but if you want to go far go together

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
it's not his saying but he says it a lot

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
so i want to talk about that and i'm

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
also going to talk about pie in part

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
because

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
at that first poscon all things open

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
that i spoke at todd

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520
uh taught fedesal because that todd's

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,199
like that it's at southern hospitality

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
but also because i like to bake pie so

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,479
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
pie

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,400
when you think of the biggest

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
contributors to open source

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
i'd be interested and we can't take a a

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
poll here and ask everybody but i'd be

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
interested who you think of when you

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
when you think of that when i say the

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,600
biggest contributor that you can think

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
of to open source

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
put it keep it in your mind

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,360
i'm pretty sure you're thinking of a

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
cloud vendor right now and if you are

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
you if you're playing your odds of the

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,039
top 10

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,080
open source contributors seven of those

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,720
top ten

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
are cloud vendors and i use the term

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
cloud

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,919
um a little bit loosely i shouldn't say

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
vendors i should say cloud companies

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
because

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,919
in that number is facebook for example

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
in that

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,919
in that group is amazon

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
in that group is google microsoft red

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
hat

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,280
ibm but also other companies

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
there are a few other companies that

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
don't fit that cloud label like

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
intel for example but intel does a fair

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
amount to enable the cloud

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
with with chips and other saw in

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,600
software

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
but think about that why would that be

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
that the vast majority

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,120
if you if you tally up the biggest

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
contributors in terms of

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,039
raw contributors um to open source why

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
would they be cloud companies

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,720
and i think it's i think it if you if

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
you step back for

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,639
for a second it's a little bit obvious

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
why that would be the case

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
it's because cloud companies don't

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
really

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
have anything to lose by contributing

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
software

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
they don't sell software facebook

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,479
doesn't sell software

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,199
aws or amazon doesn't sell software

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,199
we sell services so the software itself

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,000
can be given away and if we look again

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
at the

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
at the things that have come out of the

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,520
different cloud companies

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
amazing software like kubernetes that

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
came out of google

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
this is the sort of thing that the cloud

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
enables because it takes away the

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,600
competitive

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,840
uh need to keep software proprietary

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,840
so if you

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,919
if you run some sort of calculus as to

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
contributes equals to benefits well it

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
also makes sense

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
that the cloud companies would be big

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,199
contributors

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
uh because we're benefiting a great deal

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,360
from open source

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
and i want to talk about that but really

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,680
i want to get away

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,360
a bit from talking about

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,400
the big companies behind open source

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,280
and i want to talk about the people

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,759
behind open source and how people are

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,800
making

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,319
software open source software better in

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,919
the cloud

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
and the first person i want to talk to

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,160
about is dre

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,880
a friend of mine who uh much more

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
importantly

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,919
well much more importantly to you as to

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,520
why he's important he's

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,720
the founder of drupal but that's not how

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,479
drees started when he started drupal he

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
didn't start drupal he was looking for a

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,879
way to share

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,800
a quote-unquote high-speed adsl

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,160
internet connection as a student in

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,199
belgium

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,560
and he and his friends

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
were just looking for to build a

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
bulletin board well that little bulletin

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,120
board evolved into drupal which

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,440
last year or for the last major release

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
had

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,000
10 000 different contributors to the

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,080
project it's an amazing example

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,280
of open source success but getting from

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,479
dries and his friends to

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
dries and 10 000 of his friends and by

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,199
the way

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
dries so he started a company called

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,440
aquia

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
and despite being the largest single

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,159
contributor to

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,680
to drupal accounted for less than five

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,959
percent of those total

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
contributions to the last release so how

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,599
did he get from

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,720
one person to ten thousand

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,399
well along the way in 2000 um dries in a

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
conversation that i had with him he said

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
in 2000 it was a they were really

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,240
struggling to scale

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,480
drupal and part of that was mysql

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
mysql is a great open source database

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
but he was struggling

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
with all that as he said the hundreds of

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,839
knobs that he had to fiddle with

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,720
to get it to scale circa 2006

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
aws launches and suddenly that he's in

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
his words

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,160
that became dramatically easier and he

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,080
says you have no idea

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,920
the change that it made for drupal in

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
enabling them to scale it

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,320
so on the one hand thinking about cloud

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,360
one thing that cloud does is that it

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
makes it so that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,760
individual open source entrepreneurs and

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,360
entrepreneur i don't mean that they

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
necessarily start a business i just mean

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,320
that they start a project

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,000
an open source entrepreneur finds it

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
dramatically easier

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,519
to start and scale their project it's

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,720
one thing that the cloud does

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,600
another example a more recent example is

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
matt klein

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
with envoy envoy is this fantastic open

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,519
source project

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
that matt started as uh as an engineer

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
at lyft

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,320
in matt's words when he when he uh

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
started the

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
envoy it started off just as an initial

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
in

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,880
an internal project they were trying to

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,519
move from

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,600
a monolithic a monolith based

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,519
architecture to a micro services based

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,800
architecture and so

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,800
they he and his team created envoy

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,160
great but then they decided

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
well maybe we should open source this

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,839
and in matt's words

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
he did this in part because he thought

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,959
it'd be good for his career

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,959
lyft did it in part because they thought

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,360
it'd be great for recruiting

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,279
but it was an example of an of an

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,720
individual

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,320
uh person uh matt deciding that he

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
wanted to open source this thing and

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,680
then taking it out now

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,279
it's become this great service mesh that

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
a lot of different people use but it

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,880
started as him scratching

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,240
an itch for lyft and in thinking about

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
it in terms of we're seeing

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
again coming back to that idea of the

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,200
best software

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,360
will emerge from those who use the

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
software in dries's case it was

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,839
restarting it to

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,079
to share internet access at a university

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,720
in belgium in matt's case

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,800
it was him sharing the software that

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,120
would enable

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,200
lyft to get a higher return on their

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,040
investment and envoy

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
but they built it to to support cloud

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,200
native applications

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,200
at at uh lyft um

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,560
incidentally i asked matt recently

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,279
why don't we see more user driven open

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,480
source and user driven open source

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,560
and i try not to swear so i won't quote

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,000
him verbatim but he said

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,480
it's because it's so effing hard

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
he said but for my naivete i never would

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
have done this

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
but we're grateful that he did and now

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,320
today

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,399
he's we have this great open source

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,399
project and by the way

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,800
um if you look at the contributors to it

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
at least 40 percent roughly 40 percent

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
of that

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,200
code to contributed to envoys coming

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
from google

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
and so we see the cloud contributing

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,279
back

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,200
to uh to what it's created i want to go

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,760
to one more example

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
and this is a madeleine olsen and it's

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
the story

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,920
of reddest but that story starts not

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
with madeleine it starts with salvatore

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
san felipo

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,480
he was the founder of of redis and what

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,880
salvatore started uh

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
reddis he did it this also has another

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,639
mysql angle

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,760
he did it not because um he really

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,200
wanted to start a

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
build a new database he had no

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,880
experience with database he says i had

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,880
no idea what i was getting into i broke

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,839
all the rules on on database design

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
uh no one really would take an in-memory

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,959
database

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
seriously at the time but he did it

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,440
anyway

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
and he started it one thing that it

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,480
didn't have was

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,480
encryption built in so madeline is an

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
engineer on the elasticash team at

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,279
at aws and i think roughly two years ago

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
she and her manager decided hey you know

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,519
what

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,720
we depend in significant part on redis

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,720
we should contribute back

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,600
well you don't just walk into mordor

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
and you don't just walk into an open

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,279
source project and take over as

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
take over that project so madeline

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,680
started small and in her words

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,760
she continued to be a relatively small

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
contributor she did things like enable

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,040
greater communication by starting a

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,839
slack channel

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,279
for redis contributors she did other

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760
things like

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,959
preparing other people's contributions

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
to make it help them

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
pass muster with salvatore and she did

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,519
one thing

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,680
that she didn't get actually her code uh

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
accepted by salvatore

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,880
but she came up with the idea of how to

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,440
get encryption built into redis and

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,000
yasi got lieb one of the contributors

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,920
and

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,839
salvatore reviewed it said decided that

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,160
they didn't want to take that

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,360
her code but liked the approach and so

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
they

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
used that approach and built their own

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
code but it was little contributions

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
like that

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,040
that earned her goodwill with the team

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,079
and then recently when redis decided

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,800
or the the redis uh salvatore decided to

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,760
leave

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
redis to go pursue other things they

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
came

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
up with a new governance structure and

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
madeline was asked to be one of the five

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,560
maintainers

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,160
along with uh three folks from redis

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,199
labs and zouzou from

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,240
alibaba it's a great story

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
of how an individual

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,279
working in a cloud company because it

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,519
was solving a

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,120
particular cloud companies or scratching

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,040
our itch

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
how she went from a small contributor to

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,399
now a significant maintainer

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,519
but i think it also says a great deal

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,440
about how open source can work in the

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
cloud so here you start with salvatore

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
who by the way

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
i wish i looked like salvatore these

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,839
rugged good looks kind of looks like

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,480
michael hutchins um the uh

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:05,120
former uh vote lead vocalist for nxs

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
salvatore if you're listening man crush

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,240
on you

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,519
the but you look at what it went from

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,120
salvatore

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,880
to redis labs starting to help

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,519
fund the development of of radis

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,399
to where we are today with redis labs

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,160
continuing to

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
to fund a significant amount of the

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,880
development around redis

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
but also a number of cloud vendors

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,639
building

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,560
managed redis services around redis it's

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,959
a fantastic example and you say

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
well surely this is cratered redis labs

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,880
revenue

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,800
i don't i'm not privy to their to their

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
numbers and i wouldn't divulge them if i

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,759
were

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,920
but in my conversations with them and

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
they're a great partner of of aws

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,920
they're doing really really well it

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,519
turns out that sharing

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,959
code and sharing and growing a pie

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
is a good strategy so let's talk about

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
pie

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,240
because like i said i really like pie

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,720
and bake a lot of pie

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
let's do some pie related math so

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,759
gartner said

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,560
that in 2020

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
even with coven global i.t spending

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
should top

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,360
about 3.9 trillion dollars a lot of

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,199
money

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,959
cloud and we spend a lot of time talking

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,360
about cloud and like figuring out who's

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,480
winning in the cloud wars

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,759
well it's a relatively small piece of

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,079
that overall pie 266 billion

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
it's it's significant money but in the

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,120
grand scheme of things

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,480
it's a really small pie

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,759
i was an english major and so i'm not

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,199
necessarily great at math

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,560
but i think what that means is that

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,839
when we spend time agonizing and

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
fighting

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
over who's winning in the cloud and

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,240
who's

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
is cloud chewing into open source etc

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,720
we're talking we're fighting over six

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,720
percent of that global i.t

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,839
spend which is a little ridiculous

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,360
now we could say that well

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
you know we've been conditioned to think

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,839
about um

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,120
in this way of we're conditioned to

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,120
think about small pie

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,360
martin mikos is a good friend and about

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,839
15 years ago when he was ceo of mysql

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,199
he's now ceo of hacker one

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,559
but he went he was ceo of mysql and

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,520
he came up with this great quote saying

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,240
for in open source he wanted to take a

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
big market

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,600
make it smaller and then take a big

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,679
chunk of that market

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,720
and we're kind of used to thinking about

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,240
um when we talk about open source that

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,919
like saving money

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
and we're we talk about cloud we talk

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,760
about in the same way

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
and so we end up with this little small

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
pie it's a cute pie that's my

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
um strawberries and cream pie that i

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
like to make

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
but it's a small pie and i like pie so i

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,559
don't really want small pie

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,280
so i had this conversation with simon

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,160
wardley many of you have uh

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
know simon and and i think he's i'm sure

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
he's spoken here before in fact i think

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,919
i've heard him speak at

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
all things open before he introduced me

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,039
to this idea of

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,039
jevon's paradox and in a nutshell that

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,760
idea is

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,480
we normally think that when we save

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,559
money when unit costs go down

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,919
that the overall pie is going to shrink

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,280
that the market will shrink because

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,760
people will spend less money because

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,520
they'll pocket those savings and move on

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
turns out that's not how things work in

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,559
real life

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,280
when we save money on um

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
on our cloud spent because of our cloud

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,240
spend

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,080
we spend we end up spending more when we

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,919
save more by moving to postgres

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,760
we end up spending more on databases or

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,640
on or on other services around it

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,799
so the way that i read that is that

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,200
instead of

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,039
instead of the lower unit costs

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
that cloud and open source together

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,000
bring us instead of

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,039
that turning into less pi it turns into

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,559
more the pi isn't shrinking it's getting

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,440
bigger

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,280
and by the way that applies to to the

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,760
open source companies

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,240
i saw just last week that data bricks

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,520
they i think i think they actually

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,080
announced this that

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,679
they are now on a 350 million dollar run

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,200
rate

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,240
selling managed spark and other open

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,080
source software

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
well guess what databricks has healthy

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,880
competition

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,320
from from my company and from others

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,120
and they're doing great in part because

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,559
a variety of contributors are growing

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,520
that pie

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,000
look at mongodb doing phenomenally well

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
i think

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
roughly 500 million in revenue now

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
almost half of which getting close to

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,360
half of which comes from their cloud

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,400
service atlas

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,799
which is fantastic and you go down the

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
list

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,440
confluent recently well last year

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,039
raised money on a huge valuation doing

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,200
really really well in terms of revenue

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,640
elastic same thing redis labs data

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
stacks

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,480
hashicorp all these open source

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,039
companies doing really well

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,360
and i would argue they're doing really

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
well precisely because they've embraced

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,640
cloud

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,320
and early on we had some friction

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,360
because

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,039
over licensing gymnastics but i think

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,840
that was just a moment in time

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,440
i think it was just it it gave us time

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
until we got to the point where we

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
realized the cloud is not

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,720
competitive to open source it's an

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,679
enabler for

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,919
open source it makes it so that end

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,400
users can focus more time

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
on getting work done rather than on

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
doing the undifferentiated heavy lifting

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,400
of

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,400
setting up and managing infrastructure

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,240
it's a really good thing what we have

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,280
now

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
i want to end with um somebody who i

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,919
think is

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,039
extraordinarily smart adam jacob he was

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,400
the

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,400
co-founder and cto at chef and

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,760
uh and now the co-founder of system

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
initiative

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,440
and he talks about cloud and open source

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,559
in this way

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,520
he says you can think of it as

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,559
competitive or you can think of it

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,280
as a way of growing that overall

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
um the top of funnel or again in my

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,360
words

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,880
uh growing the pie

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,720
and i remember having this conversation

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
with a friend that i had worked with

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,919
when i was at mongodb

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,039
and we were at re invent aws re invent

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,000
back when we were

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,559
able to go and talk to people in person

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
and

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,880
it just struck me at that time that

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,960
we those two companies but in general

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
we were wasting a lot of time fighting

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,919
over relatively small

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,640
pieces of pie and that it would be much

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
better

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,080
for each of us to go out and build that

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,360
pie contribute to that upstream

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,440
open source project and we've seen that

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
at my company we've seen that with um

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,200
most recently with

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,240
radiss but also graphql and a number of

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
other projects

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
and if you look across those cloud

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,240
companies people are doing i think

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,159
a pretty good job of doing that we've

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,520
had to figure it out over time but my

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,240
sense

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,840
is that there's this great opportunity

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,960
for all of us

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,600
to build these open source pies

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,559
open source communities together we need

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
to be a little bit

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,120
patient with each other there's it's

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
easy to make accusations and assume that

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,159
we know

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,080
what other people are thinking we assume

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,720
we know why they do the things that

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
that they do whether on an individual

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
level or on a

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,760
macro level on a company level

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
i just ask that we be a little bit more

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,919
thoughtful of each other and

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,360
we remember open source is ultimately

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
about community

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,720
it's ultimately about people it's

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,400
ultimately about enabling those people

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,520
and as we do that we do something that

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,360
makes me really happy and that is we

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,440
grow the open source pie

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:30,320
thank you very much and todd again thank

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:30,320
