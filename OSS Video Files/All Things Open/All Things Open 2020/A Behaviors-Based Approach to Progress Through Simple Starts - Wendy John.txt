it's great to be here

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
everyone so hello and good morning my

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,920
name is wendy john

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,679
and i'm the head of global diversity and

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,119
inclusion at fidelity investments

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,880
and my pronouns are she her and hers

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
i'm thrilled to be joining you today

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,039
from my home in the state of north

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
carolina although i'm sure we all would

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
love to be

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
in the convention center but this

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
opportunity taking it virtual

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,320
allows many others who would not have

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,680
been able to attend in person to join in

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
with us

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
before you think i've stumbled into the

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
wrong zoom webinar

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
i wanted to clarify that yes you heard

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
that right

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,520
i'm here from fidelity investments you

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
may be wondering what in the world

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
a dni leader from a financial services

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
company is doing

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160
amongst the inspiring open source

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
speakers you'll hear from this morning

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,800
and the first reason is this we are not

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
just a finserve company we also like to

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
think of ourselves as a technology

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
company

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
we spend billions annually on technology

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
that spend covers everything from

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
customer platforms

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,439
to tools that help us collaborate to

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,759
building virtual reality experiences to

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,200
help

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,720
onboard new employees firm wide

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,360
25 of our employees work in technology

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
and in north carolina home to all things

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
open

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,880
60 of our employees are technologists

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,880
you heard me right 60 percent of my

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
fellow colleagues in north carolina

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,040
are not financial advisors not customer

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
service reps

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
but people like you who build technology

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
we pride ourselves on having an

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
innovation culture built around

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,759
continuous development

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
and a growth mindset our employees

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
participate in our blockchain club

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
join our women in technology special

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,439
interest group

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,240
and get involved with fidelity labs our

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,159
incubation lab for new ideas

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,479
we have a long history of investing in

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,799
the cutting edge with recent commitments

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,800
around cryptocurrency and blockchain

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,080
an exciting collaborations like our

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,520
quantum computing efforts with aws

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,640
fidelity is always creating in fact

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,599
we hold 259 patents on a variety of

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,599
topics

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,000
a great testament to our consistent

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,560
focus on innovation

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
one area specifically around open

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
collaboration is our work to release

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
more of our machine learning efforts as

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
open source

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
these have been focused on making common

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
algorithms available

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,599
and also for creating more simplified

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
interfaces for frameworks like

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
tensorflow

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
and pytorch you'll hear more about our

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,599
open source approach and efforts

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
from my colleagues justin ratcliff and

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
sachin sulkin

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,959
in their respective sessions at all

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
things open

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
okay so now we know why fidelity is here

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
today

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,959
but what does inclusion and diversity

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,159
have to do with technology

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,800
and more specifically open source

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
everyone attending today's event is on

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,760
the hook for co-creating something

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
innovative

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,000
you sit on teams and manage projects

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,959
that create tools and platforms

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,239
that improve people's lives maybe even

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,879
in ways they haven't

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
asked for yet the connection between

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,799
diversity and inclusion

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
innovation and profitability has been

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,760
proven

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,599
here are a few data points to ground us

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,080
all

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,080
mckinsey's 2019 analysis found that

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
companies in the top quartile for gender

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
diversity

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,920
on executive teams were 25 more likely

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,000
to have above average profitability

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,200
and this goes even further for ethnic

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
diversity

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,000
where companies in the top quartile of

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,440
ethnic diversity outperform others by 36

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
percent

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
and this holds true for times of

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,239
uncertainty like we're in

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,599
right now several reports showed that in

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
2008's global financial crisis

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,439
banks with a higher share of women on

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
their boards were more stable than their

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
peers

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
although we all know that diversity and

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
inclusion is important

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
technology and other industries like

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,600
financial services

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,759
remains largely white and male

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,359
since june of this year there's been a

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
larger spotlight on the importance of

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,120
diversity and inclusion

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
there's tremendous energy around these

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,479
topics and how it applies in all that we

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,880
do

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,280
people want to take action but often

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
don't know where to start

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,720
it's the same problem that has stalled

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,440
this work for decades

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,600
sometimes it just feels too big to solve

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
at fidelity we approach diversity and

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
inclusion a little differently

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
with a behaviors-based approach that

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,720
taps into the science of habit change

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
we have a concept called simple starts

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
which prompts our employees to make

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
adjustments to the behaviors and

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
business processes

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,720
that make up their day-to-day work by

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,240
focusing on behaviors within your

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,479
immediate control

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
rather than trying to shift an entire

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,759
organization's culture

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,680
all at once we see incremental changes

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,000
that add up significantly over time

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
our concept may be called simple starts

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
but there's nothing simple about the

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,400
work of diversity and inclusion

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,800
it's a complicated ingrained problem

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,560
that can't be solved overnight

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,479
getting started though can be a lot

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,520
simpler with some of the ideas that i'll

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,280
share with you today

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,240
i'm going to cover a few simple starts

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,199
in three distinct categories

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
team management and dynamics everyday

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
pivots

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,039
and of course technology

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
since open source is all about coming

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,160
together on collaborative teams to

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
create and build

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,919
let's start with team dynamic team

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
management and dynamics

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,120
here are a few simple behavioral changes

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,039
you can implement on your teams today

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
rotate work assignments on your team

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,639
regularly including

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
team housework like note-taking or

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
meeting scheduling and higher profile

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
projects

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,560
versus only going to the well-known few

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,880
members of your team

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
set team members up with mentors or

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,639
sponsors with different backgrounds

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,639
to expand their view of the world

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,600
encourage participation or development

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,319
of employee resource groups or ergs

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
at fidelity we have six ergs and four

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
special interest groups

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
more than half of our employees

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
participate in at least one of these

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
groups and some participate in three or

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
more

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,759
consider starting affinity groups and if

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,080
your organization does not yet have them

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,160
these groups provide ready access to

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,800
diverse thoughts and perspectives

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
they can serve as focus groups talent

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
pools

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,319
and or business partners in your work

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,160
audit the membership of your team seek

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,919
participation and contribution from a

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
diverse set of people

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
and when an underrepresented person

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
leaves your team

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,840
dig into understanding the why in case

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,160
there are changes that need to be made

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
reconsider your team participation

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,599
criteria

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,759
balance the need for specific skills

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,319
like coding which can be taught

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,960
with the value of fresh perspectives

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
which

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,759
might be impossible to teach at fidelity

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
we have a few programs focused on

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,960
non-traditional sources of talent

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,800
in technology fidelity made introduces

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,199
associates from traditionally

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
non-technical roles in the enterprise to

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,919
apply their business experience to tech

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
problems

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,560
and we partner with reach hire to

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,039
provide career paths for a diversity of

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,759
life

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,360
situations now let's talk about everyday

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
pivots

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
these are changes that everyone can make

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
regardless of their role on a team

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,879
or in an organization to be more

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,440
inclusive

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
and they span across work life and home

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
life

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
it's difficult to influence one without

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
the other and what's the difference

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,560
especially these days

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,280
you're here with me in my home language

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
matters so pay careful attention to the

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
words you use

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
use pronouns in your introductions to

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
create safety for others to share how

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,800
they

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,840
identify use more inclusive terms

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,840
for example stop using guys as a way to

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
refer to mixed groups of people

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,360
and look for something that might be a

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
little more gender neutral

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
like folks we use that a lot here in the

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,760
south of

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,519
of us capitalize the be in black

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
in your writing when referring to black

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,159
people or communities

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,279
for the open source community eliminate

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,800
terminology

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,800
like whitelist blacklist or master slave

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,279
and consider alternatives for other

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
gendered language

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,560
monitor your information diet this means

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,320
paying

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,720
careful attention that the books you

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,560
read podcasts you listen to

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,160
and the shows you view aren't all

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,880
created by people with the same

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,200
backgrounds or perspectives

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
demand a seat at the table and bring

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,279
someone new

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,760
along with you where or when possible

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,240
for the woman in the audience make sure

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,640
you're representing the work you've done

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,839
don't be shy or self-deprecating when

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,640
sharing your accomplishments

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,279
overall exposing ourselves to new

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
thoughts

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
ideas approaches and people makes us all

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
better

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
and as a result we create better

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
products and solutions

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
and last but certainly not least

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,200
technology

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,440
the good news is that due to

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,320
advancements developed by technologists

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
like you

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
we the humans don't have to do this all

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
on our own

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
here are a few ways we can use tech to

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
help us create more diverse and

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
inclusive workplaces

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
use artificial intelligence to audit the

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,519
language and job descriptions

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,760
at fidelity we run our jobs through a

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
tool that scans for bias language

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
it takes about six minutes per role but

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,320
has greatly improved the number of

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,279
female

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
applicants we receive meet diverse

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,880
people where they are

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,399
implement processes that post all of

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
your open jobs

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
to a variety of diverse online job

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,240
boards

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
remember that data isn't the end all and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
be all

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,560
my friend and leading ai ethicist and ai

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,079
activist renee cummings reminded us in a

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
recent talk at fidelity

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,440
that there's no such thing as raw data

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
the data points we use to build

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,680
technology

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,680
often comes with built-in bias because

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,519
it originates from an environment where

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,519
racism is systemic

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,959
and stereotypes have been baked in for

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
centuries

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
ensure you're evaluating all of the

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
components

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
into your technology solutions for bias

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,240
and

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,000
engage diverse stakeholders throughout

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,120
you'll hear more from another of my

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
colleagues

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,720
melinda thalbar on our approach to ai

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,440
bias and mitigation at fidelity

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,360
invest in places to come together online

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,399
of course the open source community has

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
been practicing

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,360
true online collaboration for years for

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,320
example at the linux foundation

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
covid19 has exemplified the importance

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
of creating virtual spaces for people to

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,440
gather

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,720
and share ideas ensure these online

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,079
spaces are accessible

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,320
and open to all using tools like live

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,640
closed captioning

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
as i shared those three categories

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,200
doesn't it sound a lot like people

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,480
processes and technology a framework

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,320
many of you are already familiar with

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
i hope that these simple starts i shared

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
today can help you and your teams get

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
started

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,800
if you've already started perhaps i've

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
given you a few new ways to continue the

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,920
journey

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,000
it can be easy to let the problem

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,720
paralyze you that analysis

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,560
paralysis we all know our country's

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,279
diversity and inclusion challenges may

00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,440
feel too big to solve if you zoom out

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,600
so focus on zooming in and get started

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
zoom in and shift from trying to change

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,519
the world or your company

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,320
to changing three to four behaviors on

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,079
the teams where you contribute progress

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
against diversity and inclusion is a lot

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,880
like open source in that way

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,519
most of us will not unveil a shiny new

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,600
product or solution to the problem

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
this is something we will all build

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,760
together

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,760
right out in the open bringing the best

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
of ourselves to contribute

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
and the first few attempts might not be

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
perfect but with some iteration

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,680
we can create transparent solutions that

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,560
amount to real change

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
thank you all for the time and enjoy the

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:50,079
rest of this year's

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:50,079
