all right good afternoon everybody or

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
morning or evening wherever you happen

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
to be tuning in from

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
um thanks for the opportunity um to all

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
things open to be able to talk about

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
some of the work we're doing at the

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
national security agency really excited

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
to be with you today

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,199
and talk through this um and then uh

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
this probably will not the talk won't

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
take 45 minutes so hopefully we'll have

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,480
some time at the end for

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,160
for q a and uh we've got a few folks

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
from the team on as well so we can

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
we can answer things for you all right

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,079
let's get started

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
so a little bit about me i'm a senior

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
executive technical leader at the agency

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
i've been

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,680
at nsa for almost 15 years now

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,360
which i know is a really long time in

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,280
tech but

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
it's been a great place to be i still

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
enjoy working there

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
uh i've had the opportunity to kind of

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
reinvent myself

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,440
three or four times now in terms of the

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
things i'm i'm working on

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
so i started out as an rf and computer

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,320
engineer

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,799
building systems working on kind of

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
software-defined radio

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
efforts and frameworks and things like

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
that and

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
uh ended up building something called

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,119
the red hawk software defined radio

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,560
toolkit with uh we started a whole

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,759
program and we ended up releasing it

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
open source

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,240
um from the agency so did kind of

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
development system building all those

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
things and then as we released red hawk

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
open source really got

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
into open source in general and i've

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
been doing it my whole career but that

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,880
really kind of catalyzed

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,880
my passion for it and so um

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,600
kind of been pushing that at the agency

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
and a part of it my entire career

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
and i had the opportunity to be a

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,040
technical director after that for a

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,520
little while

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
and then i was accepted into we have a

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,399
lot of development programs at the

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
agency so i was accepted into something

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,600
called the

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
senior technical development program

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
which is kind of like

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,920
um a technical phd

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,280
internally for uh techy folks inside the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
agency it's not quite a phd but

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
basically

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
you get to devote you put a proposal

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
together for a board you get to spend

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,200
some time

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,599
focused on learning something for

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
several years and so one of the things i

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,840
asked to focus on when i got in that was

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,920
open source and helping the agency

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
to catalyze where we were going to go

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
how we were going to do it

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,879
and and our processes the other thing

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,360
was software development and

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
developer advocacy and so that led to

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
something called devex which we'll talk

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
a little bit about

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,599
later and then that's all evolved now

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,640
i'm i'm the organizational chief

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,360
leading a lot of our unclassified i.t

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,040
efforts and trying to help the agency uh

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,480
move into a place to better

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
uh support telework and and our

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,599
unclassified it and i'll talk about that

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,239
a little bit as well

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,560
all right so let's start with open

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
source

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
nsa has a rich history of open source

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
software we've been doing open source

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,080
publicly for 20 years we released

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,400
se linux almost 20 years ago now

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,120
and have just continued to release and

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,840
be a part and contribute uh ever since

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
and so uh most recently guidera which

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
many people heard about those

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,599
was a big release last year uh the

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,000
reverse engineering toolkit

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,599
and that was a huge release for us a lot

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
of effort and time went into that one

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,120
and then most recently skill tree

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
was just released last week and so

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
terence pugh one of my colleagues is

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
giving a talk on that at this conference

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
so

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,840
encourage you to tune in to that it's

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,920
really exciting

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
and we're we're very excited to see that

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,360
released to the open source community

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,959
so so why do we do it why does an

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,200
intelligence agency for the us

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
government care about open source what's

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
the point

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,440
well we use a lot of open source

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
software um

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,640
you know we're a tech we're part of the

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,239
tech industry we hire lots of developers

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,400
uh lots of mathematicians and

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,760
we have a really kind of rich history

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,000
around all that

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,200
and so we want to be able to contribute

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,560
back to that we want to be able to give

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
give back to the community and um

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,599
you know i just realized that one of my

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,640
slides

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,320
didn't make it over um

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,239
from a previous thing that's all right

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,759
we'll keep moving

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,120
so um we want to engage the open source

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
community we want to be part of it we

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
want to not just release things but we

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,520
want to contribute back as well

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,199
and there's proven results right i think

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
there's no question now in the tech

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
community

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,520
how foundational open source is and

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
uh i think the tech industry is just

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
adopting it

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,919
and making it core a core part of the

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,360
way we do business all the big tech

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,759
companies are doing this and so i don't

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
think that's up for debate anymore

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,759
but it's it's really critical that the

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,320
federal government and and

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
nsa in particular is part of that

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
community as well

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,199
and its policy in 2016 um the federal

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
government released

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,320
the us federal government really source

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
code policy m1621

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
which encourages the use and

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
contribution back to

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880
open source software so i'm going to

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
take just a quick

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,759
second and talk a little bit about

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
nsa itself um because we lost i lost

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
that slide somehow today sorry about

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
that

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,440
when i was transitioning things over so

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
for those of you not familiar

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
national security agency is um part of

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
the us intelligence community we've been

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
around since 1952

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
we have two primary missions we have the

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,360
foreign signals intelligence mission

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
which is to penetrate sensitive uh

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
networks and communications for our

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
adversaries

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
with the goal to understand the plans

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
and intentions

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
and be able to give those insights to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
our u.s policy makers

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
military commanders cyber defenders and

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
our allies support military operations

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
that kind of thing

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,759
the other primary mission for the

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
national security agency is cyber

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
security

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,479
to safeguard the national national

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,600
security systems and then protect and

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,360
defend those and then

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
provide general cyber security advice to

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
us network uh defenders

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
and to our allies and so that's kind of

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,039
what we're about um

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
as an agency and you can imagine with

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,400
those two missions

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
we have a highly technical workforce we

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
are the largest

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,160
um employer of mathematicians in the u.s

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
and um we have um

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
over 40 000 affiliates so we're a big

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
company uh

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
or in line with kind of big companies a

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
very large

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,919
tech workforce and so open source really

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,199
plays into that for us

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,800
as as kind of a key driver for our

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
technical success and we want to be able

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,600
to be part of that community

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,720
okay so let's talk a little bit about

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
some of the challenges

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,199
and the support inherent to

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
being part of the federal government but

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
also wanting to contribute to open

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
source

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,280
so there are some challenges um

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
copyright is one of those

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,639
so federal employees are not afforded

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
copyright protection under us law

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,919
it's a little different when you start

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
looking at overseas

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
and so that's a bit of a challenge

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,880
because a lot of open source

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,280
licensing is based on sort of the

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
fundamental principle of copyright

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,000
the second thing is if you're in the

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
intelligence community and you're

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
working on classified things as part of

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
your job you have a

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
uh we have an obligation for those

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
things to be reviewed before we put them

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
on the public pre-publication if it has

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
to do with your job

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,039
and so you know you can imagine

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
somebody's working on some some cool

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,360
tech

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
we figured out a reasonable sensible way

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
to separate the things that are

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
sensitive from the things that aren't

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
sensitive

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
we still have to do uh equity kind of

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,400
process to make sure

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
that that's reasonable so we'll talk

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,759
about that a little bit more but there

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
is a lot of support so i talked about

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,080
the policy earlier from 2016.

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,160
we've got code.gov 18f usds and the

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,000
defense digital services gsa

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
have all spent a ton of time on this are

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
still spending a ton of time on this

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,960
uh providing a lot of support guidance

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,319
repositories for people to kind of

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,199
document what they're doing how they're

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,440
doing it

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,800
and it's really incredible kind of the

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,360
support across the federal government

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,680
um okay so let's talk a little bit about

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,720
our approach specifically nsa

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
so there is some some cultural uh you

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
know

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,479
things that are interesting as part of

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
nsa right we are a part of the

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
intelligence community

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
we can't talk about most of the things

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
we work on and so

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
there is still some sort of questions

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
that we answer

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
and get in these interesting

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
conversations where folks maybe aren't

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
familiar with open source they're like

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
hey

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
can we do that can we just release code

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
out there is it is it secure is it more

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
secure is it less secure

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,639
and thankfully because of the federal

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,000
source code policy because of the

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
precedent set across the federal

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
government and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
just sort of the overwhelming

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,399
understanding

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,279
across the tech sector a lot of these

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,880
questions are

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,080
are pretty straightforward to answer now

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,360
more so than they were 15 years ago

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
when i first started kind of getting

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
involved in open source at the agency

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,279
i will say our processes have come a

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,600
really really long way

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,040
so uh the first kind of open source

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
effort i was involved in was

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
was red hawk as i mentioned before this

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,640
was back in 2011 and

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
by the time we decided that we wanted to

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,320
open source and kind of got

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
general buy-in from our management it

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,640
took 18 months

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
from sort of that decision to actually

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
flipping the switch on github to make

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,000
that that public release

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
and uh that was incredible amount of

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,440
hard work

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,360
by a lot of people on on my team and

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
other folks from support from our legal

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
and policy teams

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
but that's really a long time to go and

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
so a group of folks over the years

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,480
myself included but i'm not the only one

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
have been working to say

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
how can we improve that process so

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,800
here's what it looks like uh today and

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
again we're continuing to improve this

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
there's kind of three main

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,000
um steps to this there's the pre-release

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
release approval and post release and

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
we'll talk about that a bit

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
as i mentioned before federal employees

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
aren't afforded copyright protection

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,640
under u.s law and so

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,080
traditionally these projects that we've

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,200
released from the government have been

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
public domain

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
but that doesn't jive very well with

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
kind of

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
the open source licenses and how people

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
are normally

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
accustomed to contributing to projects

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,720
and dealing with

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,360
with various open source licenses and so

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
we have partnered with defense digital

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
services and the code.mill

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
folks to kind of put together a draft

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,240
approach we're still kind of working to

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
finalize some of these things

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,760
but generally speaking we kind of start

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
with with this flow and so it starts

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
with the pre-release why are we doing it

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
uh what's the approach we're going to

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,760
take is it going to go

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,959
on github are we going to be supporting

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,480
it right we don't want to just put

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
projects out there

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
um and then never touch them again right

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,160
because somebody just wanted to release

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
their code right it's got to be a

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,279
commitment

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,440
um to kind of be active now now some

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
projects do fall off right and we don't

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
you know every i think every open source

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
area and community has that where

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
you don't always support things forever

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
but generally speaking that's one of the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
questions we ask our teams is why are

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,440
you doing this what's your commitment

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
are you going to be around and support

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
this and be part of this

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
and then ultimately does management

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
support that and buy off on it

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,120
and then we go through the release

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
approval process and you kind of see the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
flow chart on the right

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
of all the types of questions we ask and

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
the paperwork we go through here and

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
this is really important it seems

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,079
it seems heavyweight but for a large

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,519
intelligence community agency it's

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,200
really critical that we

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,040
are sensible and uh well

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,480
kind of intentioned we have kind of

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
clear intentions of

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,959
of releasing intellectual property like

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
this and so the idea here is

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,839
well you know has to be unclassified

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
right we can't be releasing sensitive

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,120
things

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
um what sort of legal implications are

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
there if we

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,760
we often work with industry partners

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,519
through defense contractors on

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
software so we've got to make sure all

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,839
the contract legal things are in place

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,519
for intellectual property there

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,120
and then kind of what are the pros or

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,480
cons like is this the right thing to do

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
for the agency and i think

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,000
some of those decisions are very similar

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
to what any large company would make is

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
this the right thing to release

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,279
is it good is it kind of good for the

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,839
the sector in general and good for the

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
community

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
in general and is it something that we

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
support um

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,839
at a large level and then finally we

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,040
kind of get to the post release

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,040
and um this is um

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,839
yep sorry this is um i was making sure i

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,200
was tracking the right things

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
this is where we talk about how to

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
accept contributions how we're going to

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
communicate to the community

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
remember i talked about pre-publication

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
before and this is where we want to

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,600
make sure that our teams understand how

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,959
they're allowed to communicate

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
with the open source world folding in

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
all the constraints we have as being

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
part of the federal government and part

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
of the intelligence community

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,000
and then how we're going to accept those

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
contributions and so we're tentatively

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
telling teams right now to kind of pick

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
one of two ways although this isn't

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,920
these aren't the only two ways for sure

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
and it's not the only two ways we do it

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
either

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
but if teams don't know how they want to

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,519
accept contributions we say hey

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
inbound outbound is really the easiest

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,040
it's the default for most projects

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
it's the default for github if you put

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,120
things on there and don't label it

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
which basically says uh whatever license

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,519
you put on the project

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,160
that's how you're gonna accept

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,240
contributions based on that license

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
and then we've got the dco the developer

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
certificate of origin which has gained

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
lots of popularity over the last few

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
years

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
uh it's the linux kernel communities

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,399
where it came from

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,279
and um docker and android and openstack

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
and a few others

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
use this to accept contributions or have

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,320
historically

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
and so this is kind of the approach

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
we're working through now we're still

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,000
trying to finalize this and kind of

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
to bake it in but we've we've seen a lot

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
of success with our teams and our and

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
our current

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,839
skill tree release this week went

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
through this process as well

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,199
all right let's talk about devex a

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
little bit

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,079
so the open source efforts have kind of

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,000
been going on as i said for 20 years

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,320
and one of the things is we were really

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,920
digging into this about four years ago

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
and trying to figure out how to make the

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,480
processes better and make it more

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
accessible

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
to developers across the agency not just

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,920
big teams that are well funded but

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,240
but an individual who just wants to

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,240
contribute we realized we needed a

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
central developer nexus

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
for the whole ecosystem open source was

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
critical

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,120
but without the rest of kind of a common

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,639
place for developers to go and ask

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
questions and get support and have an

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,880
advocacy group

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
it was tough to really have the platform

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
to improve open source

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,839
by itself and this is this is how devex

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
was born there was a group of us who got

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
together and said

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
we really need a central team that's

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,440
kind of

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,560
focused on the developer experience and

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,160
uh so that's what we did and

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
the kind of the big goals of that are to

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
deliver world-class software developer

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
tools

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,800
we have amazing talent at the at the

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
national security agency and there was

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
lots of

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
tools and flows and development

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,240
practices

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
all over the place that were fantastic

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,160
the challenge is if you were a new team

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
didn't have a lot of funding you maybe

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
didn't know where to go

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
and who was going to support that and

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
who was going to make sure the latest

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,399
tech was coming in and who could you

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
call if you had an issue

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,560
and there wasn't really that place

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
before and now there is

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,760
we also wanted a place that could

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
advocate for developers needs

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,600
that could promote uh best practices

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,560
like devops and then elevate the

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
security

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,839
practices through all parts of the

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
development

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,120
and so that's what devex is so there's

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,040
there's kind of five main

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,120
pillars in devex brief summary that our

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
our main goal here was to increase the

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
throughput and velocity

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
velocity and quality production software

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
delivery to nsa it's a pretty generic

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,079
goal

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
but we are passionate about that and it

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,800
really motivates

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,560
how we do business uh in the devex arena

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,560
so from a productivity space this is

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,880
kind of our atlassian product suite

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,240
digital kanban boards really trying to

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
provide those tools that

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,839
allow developers to to track things have

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,440
the workflows they need and the

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
visibility they need to get their

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,519
their work done we have a security team

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,920
that's focused on things like supply

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
chain

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,120
code security cloud security and

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,320
really elevating that and kind of

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
providing common

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,519
best practices for all of those things

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,120
and

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,440
really making that better every single

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
day our ecosystem team which is where

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,759
the skill tree

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
program lives is focused on all those

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,320
things

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,000
that are are critical to making

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
the lives day-to-day better for

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,800
developers at the agency

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,720
we live most of our folks live on an air

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,320
gap to network a network that's not

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,000
connected to the internet

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
and so there's some challenges presented

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
in that space right we can't just go out

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
through federal because of federal

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,279
regulations security regulations

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,279
and then some of the regulations we have

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,199
at the nsa we can't just go out and use

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,120
internet services to track things and

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
kind of look at various aspects of the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,160
job like we like maybe a small startup

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
company could

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,399
and so this team is really dedicated on

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,399
providing a rich ecosystem

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
inside for nsa developers and it's

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
really critical so there's a program

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,880
called dev hub which is

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,480
sort of a central place for all things

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,240
documentation related

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,839
and guidance related for software

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
development that's where our

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,800
open source program lives and then

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,559
you'll you'll hear more about skilltree

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,919
which is a microlearning gamification

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
platform

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,600
we have a community team that's focused

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,520
on outreach to our ic partners our

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,559
intelligence community partners

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,640
across dod and the ic and providing kind

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,679
of common tools and services

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,600
across those uh

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
agencies where it makes sense and kind

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,480
of building those partnerships

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,319
and then we have our pipeline team and

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
this is where our a lot of our gitlab

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,400
and devops work happens and i'll talk a

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,720
little bit about there

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
and devops is just critical to how we do

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
business um

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,679
and and you know it's it is kind of a

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
buzzword and can be a buzzword but for

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,880
us it means more than that right we

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
really want to get

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
development teams and production teams

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,640
to think about things like

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,160
lead time deployment frequency mean time

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,200
to restore change failure

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,039
percentage measurable quantifiable

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,760
values to track progress

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,280
towards reliability over time so to that

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,600
end this is one of the teams we worked

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,480
with the chief architects at nsa

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,640
to build in some devops best practice

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,679
metrics and measurements

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,360
and practices to our program reviews

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,039
that can get applied to every program at

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,640
the agency and so it gives us the

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,080
opportunity to ask those questions as

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,000
programs come through that and so

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,280
we're really committed to that from a

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
devex perspective and

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,039
trying to help the agency under folks

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,480
who don't understand it folks who do

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,280
uh have a place to go to get the

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,799
resources they need

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,320
all right so we'll talk a little bit

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,280
about github i mean gitlab

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,799
so uh one of our our lead for this

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,960
program eric mosher gave a

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,480
presentation recently at one of the get

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,400
lab conferences but i'll just kind of

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,799
give a quick summary here to kind of

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,320
summarize what devex is all about

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,160
and this is kind of how we went from

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,640
scaling

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
to a very small effort to a very large

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,000
well-supported effort for

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,000
our devops pipeline at the agency and so

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,240
we kind of started we have i mentioned

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
before we have a very

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,679
kind of rigorous security environment

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
and a lot of federal guidelines that we

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,480
have to abide by it's really important

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
because of the work we do

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
to really kind of make sure we're doing

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
that right but that can be challenging

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,960
because we do have

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
an air gap environment we aren't

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
connected to the internet

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,520
and we but we still need our developers

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
to have the latest and greatest

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,320
capabilities

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,240
security is our middle name so we have

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,919
to we have to be very careful about this

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,679
stuff

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
so in the early days we had several

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,559
gitlab kind of projects floating around

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
volunteer-led big kind of big monolithic

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
instances that were really customized

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,080
heavily to fit into our environments

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
and so they kind of got bogged down they

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,799
weren't as performing as we wanted to

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
and it was really easy to get out of

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
date because we heavily modified the

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
source code

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,840
which is we all know if you're if you're

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,280
heavily modifying the source code it's

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,080
not getting back up into the mainline

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,440
branches and trunk then it can present a

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,559
lot of challenges and so we really

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,960
wanted to provide

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,640
the best experience here possible in a

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
secure way

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
and reduce the numbers uh the number of

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,520
instances there and so

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,960
what we did is we had the opportunity

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
nsa does a lot of public private

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
partnerships with a lot of

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,760
industry partners and so we worked with

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,000
gitlab

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
inc public sector and some aws solutions

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,159
architects to design

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,960
a cloud-native version that worked on

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,159
our top secret instance of aws

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,600
and we wanted it to be high availability

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,280
credibly performant and really work um

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,440
uh the like people would expect

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
on the internet right and so we went

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,000
away kind of from the volunteer-led

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
and monolithic instance there to a

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,600
funded

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
team we created a two pizza team that

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,520
went

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
that kind of came together to work with

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,280
our industry partners and we practiced

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
the deployment we practiced the

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,120
transition

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,799
we built kind of a core model

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,720
where we plugged in our security in

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,720
modular ways as opposed to kind of

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
modifying the core source code heavily

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
so we could keep up and be more agile

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,679
with the deployments and the new

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,240
security features that are coming out

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
and then we were able to deploy uh

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,880
gitlab onto

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,400
our internal aws cloud with success so

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,440
we use cloud formation

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,159
saltstack we actually used a gitlab ops

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,720
instance to deploy gitlab so we kind of

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,840
really

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,640
bought into the infrastructure's code

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,159
model and

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
practice that over and over and over

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,440
again the migration of years and years

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,799
and years of intellectual property we

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,799
wanted to get that right

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,240
and developers need that service every

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,840
day and so

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,200
it took a couple months to really kind

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
of plan all that out get all the

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,600
practice done

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,520
but it was very successful and now our

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
developers are really happy

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,960
we serve thousands and thousands of

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,000
developers every month

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,400
and it is a much more performant uh

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
usable system than it was previously and

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,440
so it's it's really exciting to kind of

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,840
see the principles

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
that were built up in devex of devops

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
and infrastructure's code and kind of

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
all the things we've learned over the

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
years

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,760
applied into something like gitlab

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
if you want to know more about that i

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,080
would definitely encourage you to check

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,720
out eric's talk

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,640
he went into a lot more detail about the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,039
the tech behind it

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
okay so last thing is here i want to

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,200
talk about a little bit is telework

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,200
at nsa so i know this is a big topic

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
across the world right now with covid

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,159
right it's how agencies are figuring

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,600
this out how companies are figuring this

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
out whole industries are figuring this

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
out

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
and so one of the fundamental questions

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
i think people have now is canon

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,720
intelligency

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,120
can an intelligence agency figure this

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,840
out is this something we can support

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
and do the short answer is yes and we're

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,600
working on it

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,960
historically though telework it was not

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,480
that prevalent at nsa

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,400
right most of our work was done on the

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
top secret network um

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
most of our folks were able to just go

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,120
to work every day and do that work and

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
it there just wasn't a big need for it

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,640
some folks still worked here and there

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,720
but it just wasn't something that we

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,520
pursued and didn't necessarily

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
need to go after our work has evolved

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
over the last

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,360
five or ten years though with software

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
development our engagement with cyber on

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,200
the cyber security front with

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,159
industry partners academia government

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
there's a lot of

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
more need to be on the internet and

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360
collaborating on the internet than maybe

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
there was 10 or 15 years ago

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,200
a lot of the work we do requires and

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,880
thrives on that collaboration

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,799
so there was already these conversations

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,840
happening over the last five years 10

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,000
years of

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
supporting more unclassified

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,760
internet-facing work

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
to that end we'd actually already built

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
about four years ago

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
something we call a protected low side

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,520
development environment it's on

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,679
commercial cloud services

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,120
we wrapped a lot of security around it

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,480
and some of our developers had been

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,360
leveraging that

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,480
primarily from our office space though

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,480
to do

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
this unclassified we call it low side

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,760
work versus high side which is the top

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,520
secret network

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
um and and we've been doing that for a

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
while and one of the big kind of

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,440
revelations there was

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,679
um when covet hit and we were kind of

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
driven to this posture of trying to

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,360
to support social distancing and things

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,960
like that was wow we built that so

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,080
securely

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
that we could probably let our folks use

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,799
that from home

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,000
and that there's no additional risk

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,000
there and so that's what we've been

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,440
doing uh from a software development

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
perspective which has worked really

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,559
really well

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,080
some of the other things we're pursuing

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,760
right now is

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,880
standing up and embracing microsoft

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,600
office 365 for clap for collaboration

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,200
for kind of virtual meetings and

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,960
documents and things like that

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,640
i talked about our protected low side

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
development environment we're also

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,039
building out a variation of that

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
uh to allow for even more collaboration

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,720
with folks who don't have clearances

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,400
right so we can do technical work with

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
folks from academia and other government

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,880
agencies

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,240
and industry partners and so um we're

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
really just trying to

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,960
figure out how to scale these things

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,679
even more and we're investing a lot of

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,080
time and energy into this

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,159
we've put a lot of work into it over the

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,480
last eight months in particular

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
as kopi 19 has really forced that

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
conversation

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,679
and that look the great news is we were

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,120
already on a path to do that

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
and all the solutions we're putting in

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
place today they're here to stay we're

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
not

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,640
standing up temporary things that are

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,880
going to go away

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
you know next year or the year after

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,520
these are things that our agency was

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,919
already on the path to do

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,600
we've accelerated some to meet the meet

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,840
the need and meet the demand

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,279
from a telework perspective and so we're

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
really now focused on what are the

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,039
processes procedures and guidelines

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
we need to put in place to make this a

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,320
sustained approach that we can

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
look at year over year and how to do it

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,679
and so

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
there's there's kind of three main

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
questions we ask when it comes to the

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
space

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,000
can and should this work be done in a

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,520
sensible way in the unclass environment

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
right that's that's first and foremost

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
right

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,640
um we have to start there we can't move

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,400
all of our work down to

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
the unclassified side some of our work

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
is very sensitive and needs to stay

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,679
protected for national security reasons

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,360
and that's okay but the things that that

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
can be moved down let's take a hard look

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,120
at those and there's

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,279
there's a cross kind of a full full

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,200
directory across the whole agency team

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,200
looking at that right now

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
and okay then the next question is what

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
it is needed to support that right

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
if it's a software development thing can

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
we use our protected software

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
development environment

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,799
if it's for virtual meetings can we use

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
something like microsoft teams

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,840
and how do we how do we map that to it

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,840
and if it's something new

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,600
can we stand up a new program and is

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,799
that merited and is there support for

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,159
that and things like that

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,159
and then the last thing is kind of the

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
fundamental question uh that i think is

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
true everywhere is does the employee

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,440
have the proper training and all the

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,840
approvals to go go ahead and move into

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,640
the telework environment and so

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,080
it's been a really incredible um effort

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
over the last eight months a lot of

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
people put a lot of work into it

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,640
but the good news is it's building on

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
a foundation that was already in place

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,600
before and is going to continue

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
uh hopefully long after uh the current

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,159
pandemic

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,919
subsides so that's where we're at today

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,919
okay so that's all i had kind of for for

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,480
the prepared slides happy to take some

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,400
some q a now and really appreciate the

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,880
opportunity to talk to you today about

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,559
our open source uh devops and and

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
telework efforts going on at the agency

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,520
right now

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,799
all right i'm going to flip over i think

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,360
we've got some questions coming in

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,360
as well

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,799
okay here's one when you decide

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,399
whether some code will be publicly

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,159
released before you start so you can

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,760
tailor it properly or once it's complete

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,279
so it's proven useful so when do you

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,600
decide that question

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,760
um so the answer to that is

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,279
is a bit of both to be honest there are

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,679
some times where

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,679
we have projects that have been built

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,480
for a very specific use case

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
inside the nsa and we realized later

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
that there's nothing sensitive about

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,760
them and it would be a really useful

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,880
tool

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,240
for the outside world but as the

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,799
prevalence of open source

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,720
and kind of our internal developer

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,640
evangelism and advocacy has gone on

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,760
particularly the devex team

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,200
i think people are starting to think

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,880
about that more and we're encouraging

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,320
people now to say hey if

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,000
if the thing you're going to go build

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,360
you know up front doesn't have anything

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,880
sensitive in it and it'd be useful the

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,200
community why don't you go ahead and

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,039
start thinking about that from day one

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
go ahead and be careful with the

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,880
intellectual property decisions you make

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
be careful with the the way you

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,640
architect that solution

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,039
and think about open source from day one

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,760
and i would say skill tree is more that

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,000
more the latter than the former it was

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,559
started out as a specific way to help

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,840
train a particular tool that we had

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,279
inside

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,960
but i think very quickly that team

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,760
realized wow this could be a powerful

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,039
tool that

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,799
the rest of the open source community

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,480
would really like and so they kind of

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,679
baked that into their mindset

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,919
from then on so um

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,960
okay which chat application do you use

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,520
um so

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,799
i mentioned this a little bit i think um

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,320
at the end there

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,520
so we are heavily invested

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,559
in microsoft office 365 um actually

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,200
on all our networks and so um when we

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,799
talk about

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,320
sort of the telework environment

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
microsoft teams is what we're using

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,799
there

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
but we're also that the agency's working

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,440
in effort um

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
to bring that capability to our internal

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
networks as well

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,159
for the ic so that's that's kind of our

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,679
primary

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:20,080
method there um

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,080
okay let's see

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,039
all right for your telework initiative

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,320
this talks about the how do we connect

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,120
into the infrastructure and how do you

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,679
allow

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,159
external connections that really depends

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
on

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,360
the environment which we're talking

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,039
about and so

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,960
i can't get into too many details there

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,679
about the architecture and the design

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,159
but generally speaking we are leveraging

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,320
cloud services commercial cloud services

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,159
and we're also leveraging some internal

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,919
kind of on-premise capabilities as well

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
and so it really just depends on

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,200
the environment and how we're

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,000
approaching the problem what the right

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
tech is to use

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,080
when you say devex it that is the term

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,320
being developer experience and not

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,679
devex.com i haven't heard of devx.com i

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
should probably know that but yes it's

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,799
an internal term

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,919
we were using to describe developer

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,919
experience at nsa

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,000
all right let me click these done

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,880
um okay so we have a question here

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
about um nsa is doing these great

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,600
initiatives do you think it will become

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,799
a trend in the intelligence community

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,919
with telework

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,279
and devex or just specific to nsa um

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,679
it's hard to say you know i don't want

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,320
to speak um i don't want to speculate on

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,000
that i will

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,919
i will talk a little bit about what

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,799
we've seen in the devex front so every

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,080
year

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,760
devex sponsors an ic wide

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,520
kind of developer conference internal

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,720
to the intelligence community and it's

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,080
really widely attended and really

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,919
popular and so

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,519
you know i can say that kind of the

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,600
trends of

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,440
adopting devops practices adopting

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,200
modern software development practices

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,720
adopting sort of the cid cd models the

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,960
infrastructures code is just as

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,159
highly embraced inside the federal

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,679
government technical

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,720
agencies as it is in the outside kind of

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,559
tech industry

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
now we may have some different

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,919
regulations and different security

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,679
constraints that have have made some of

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,600
those go faster slower that just really

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,399
depends on the agency in the project but

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,679
you know our folks are kind of going to

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
all the same conferences reading all the

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
same books

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
learning all the same things that a lot

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,760
of the tech industry is and are really

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,080
trying to adopt that and scale and build

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,120
out

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:47,840
our expertise as well

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,840
um okay got that one

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,919
um okay so this question do we maintain

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,000
separate code bases or branches of

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
public release projects specific to

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,120
msa's uses of the project

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
like do we maintain a generic or in

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,200
specific versions of the project

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,559
that just depends i think most of that

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,799
comes down to the architecture what we

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,120
really try to encourage teams to do

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:14,640
is build their projects in a modular way

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,240
so they're fundam there usually is going

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,159
to be a sensitive application to some of

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
the things we build not always

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,279
um and so when there is that separation

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
it

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,399
we encourage folks instead of trying to

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,960
maintain separate branches

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
or may maintain different uh baselines

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,279
to really focus on modularity

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
so add in in a modular way the things

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,399
that they need to be able to do the

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,600
specific mission we need done

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,880
um and not you know not trying to create

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,559
a more complex

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,080
configuration management problem so

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,519
that's kind of general principles but

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,919
the actual specifics are

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,120
are really um down to each project and

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,080
what sort of architecture they have and

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
what decisions they've made

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,799
has adopting telework limited restricted

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,799
hiring in the ic

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,399
i don't quite understand that question

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,360
but i will say

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,720
to this one of the big things we're

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,279
trying to do

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,799
as part of our initiatives with with

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,640
telework and all these things is allow

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,080
our recruiters and our hiring folks

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,760
the flexibility to really um

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,679
be able to do their job in this really

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,159
kind of heavily virtual world right a

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,000
year ago most recruiting events

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,440
um that we seem to be a part of were

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,679
physical right you went to a campus you

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,799
went to a recruiting fair you you did

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,960
um these other things and

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
um now it's all shifted to virtual and

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
so one of the big pushes from an i.t

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
perspective that we're really trying to

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,279
support our hiring and recruiting folks

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,720
is to be able to adapt

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,320
and be in that world and be really

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
successful and do that

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,760
okay it seems like there's a lot of

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,440
specialized security related knowledge

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,640
needed to work at nsa do people tend to

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,159
come in with that knowledge or do they

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,559
learn as they go

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,080
that's a really great question um it's

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,720
probably

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,679
both um depending on where the person

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,200
comes from so

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
a lot of our security kind of knowledge

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,560
and and the

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,599
guidelines we have to follow are federal

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,960
we have to follow all the nist

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,520
guidelines and so

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,359
we kind of talk about nist 853 a lot of

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,960
federal agencies most federal agencies

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,960
have to um

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
abide by all those guidelines so there's

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,119
there's a chance you've kind of been

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,320
working with the federal government you

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
may have been exposed to some of these

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
things before

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,639
uh but then in addition to that we have

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
another set of

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,079
security related things that we are very

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,839
focused on

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,320
when it comes to particularly deploying

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,879
i.t and securing that i.t

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,839
inside nsa and so those are things that

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,560
in some cases

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,919
you have to learn kind of as you go

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,359
applying obviously

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,119
the security knowledge that you may have

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,119
gained in other experience or in

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,839
education and things like that as well

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,919
um but we do take it very very seriously

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,839
and spend a lot of time and energy on it

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,839
for uh i think for very good reasons

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,839
okay

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,400
what do you consider top secret versus

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
public in a code sense

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,079
that's a good question um that's part of

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,880
the question we ask our developers

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,480
and our managers to ask on a regular to

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,240
ask themselves on a regular basis right

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,320
what's sensitive about what you're doing

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,680
what's not when it comes into the

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,839
different classifications there's all

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,599
sorts of guidelines

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,440
across across the federal government

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,040
about those classification levels

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,119
so i'm not going to get into that here

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,040
and it's very specific to the topic

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,720
but generally when it comes to software

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,160
i think probably more the fundamental

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
question is

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,280
you know is there any anything sensitive

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,480
about

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,160
the effort that um that shouldn't be

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,520
that would that would compromise

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,640
anything from our mission right that's

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,960
the real question

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,560
and a lot of times with software

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,440
particularly we talk about frameworks

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,440
and things like that

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
it's the data and how it's used that's

00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,760
sensitive versus the actual software

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
itself and so

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
that's we're finding in a lot of cases

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
it's like oh like skill tree or some of

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,160
these other things that we're working on

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,000
that can totally be released

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,599
um we might use it on a system on the

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,119
inside that's sensitive but the actual

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,640
software itself is okay to release and

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,920
so that's that's kind of an ongoing

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,560
conversation per

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
per project

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:27,520
okay got that one

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,760
that one

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,000
um okay this is a great question i love

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,920
this question is oss participation

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,839
um being seen as a recruitment retention

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
tool if not what does nsa get out of

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,320
participating in open source

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,960
um i would say primarily that's not our

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,119
goal

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,359
but it is a side benefit of it so let me

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,119
explain um

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,480
i think our primary goal with open

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,960
source is

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
that community aspect that we hire tons

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,240
and tons of really smart people

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,760
who come out of school come from other

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,280
jobs and industries where they've

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,800
participated in open source right and

00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,599
they really enjoy it they're passionate

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,839
about it

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,800
and we are contributing and building

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,480
great things too

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,320
that we believe and our folks believe

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,040
and want to give back to the open source

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,880
community

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,720
and particularly as civil servants

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,119
i think there there's even more to be

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,079
said personally that's my personal view

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,599
that we could uh that it's it's a great

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,680
opportunity to give back

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,839
you know our salaries are are paid for

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,000
by taxpayer dollars

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,040
and so i think that's that's part of it

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,040
but then also

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,400
it's kind of being part of the open

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,720
source community making open source

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,560
and software better has been proven to

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,599
create more secure software

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,599
better software right like a lot of the

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,040
software that's under pending under

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,160
underpinning things that are

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,079
major shifts that are happening right

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,920
now is open source and i don't think

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
that's any different than kind of

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,400
how we want to be a part of that and so

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,960
i think a side benefit

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
is that it does give us a platform to

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,599
talk about

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,359
some of the technical work we're doing

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,839
and from a recruiting perspective to say

00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,960
hey

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,160
if you're interested in some of the

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
types of technical work that you could

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,599
be doing

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,359
check out code.nsa.gov and you'll see

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,400
giger you'll see skill tree you'll see

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,480
red hawk and

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,599
things like that and so there it is a

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
nice part for

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:18,320
for recruiting and hiring but i don't

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:20,640
think that's the main goal

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,079
um i would as i would here's another

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,000
question i would think that releasing

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
certain types of software would also be

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,599
qualifies revealing capability i assume

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,280
that would be case where software

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,119
couldn't be released as open source

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,880
uh yep that's that's part of the the

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
review process is

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,480
what's it reveal what does it not reveal

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,880
is this a sensible thing to do or not

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
um what are the pros and cons and and to

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,440
be honest

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,520
from talking to other industry partners

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,680
and other government agencies i think

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,760
that math is not all that different from

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,800
what other folks do in other companies

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,400
the the difference of sensitivity that

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,760
how you rate sensitivity might be

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
different you know we might look at it

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,839
from a classification scale

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,520
whereas a company might look at it from

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,359
a proprietary or intellectual property

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,839
perspective

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,280
but the the calculus is similar i think

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,280
in some ways or at least analogous

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,160
okay i don't see oh we did get another

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,160
one come in um

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,359
all right we've got a question coming in

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,560
what would be the most important

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,240
soft skill for a new nsa technologist to

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,040
have

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,960
that is a great um that's a great

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,920
question

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,800
um i just speaking for me personally i

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,560
think

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
this is it's probably true of almost any

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640
company or any industry from a

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,760
technologist and that's curiosity and

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:50,000
a willingness to learn both from a

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,000
um technical perspective but also from a

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
kind of professional perspective right

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
what are the what are the technical

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,240
skills i need to hone

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,079
what are those other skills i need to

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,280
own in terms of being able to work on

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,440
teams

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,560
work in a large organization understand

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,560
priority

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,760
be able to communicate well and so i

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,920
think the

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,960
that kind of intrinsic curiosity and

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
desire to grow

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,000
and and become better at whatever you're

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
working on i think

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,680
is is just really critical um and one of

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,040
the things that

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,480
we at least my team we work to challenge

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,480
