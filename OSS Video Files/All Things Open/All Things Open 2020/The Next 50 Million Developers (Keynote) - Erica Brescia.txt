Publication date: 2020-10-22
Playlist: All Things Open 2020
Description: 
	Presented by: Erica Brescia, GitHub
Presented at All Things Open 2020

Abstract: We all rely on the ever-growing body of open source software that serves as the building blocks powering much of the modern world. In order to support this continued growth — both to maintain the software we already have and create the software of the future — the Open Source community will double in size in the next five years. Erica Brescia, chief operating officer at GitHub, will share insight into the incredible growth and global expansion occurring in Open Source, and the evolution that is necessary to attract the talent and potential of the next 50 million developers.

[Applause]

00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,990
[Music]

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,719
[Music]

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,960
hello

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
thanks for having me and thanks to

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
everyone joining today

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,559
while i miss seeing friends in person

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
the shift of virtual events has had a

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,600
huge impact on making conferences like

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
ato

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
more accessible to folks all over the

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
world

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,840
and that's actually pretty relevant

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,160
about what i'm here to talk to you

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,399
about today so let's dive in

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,719
the amount of software that we the human

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
race will rely on in the coming decades

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,160
will grow

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
exponentially our cars will continue to

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
get smarter

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
software will continue to help us

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
diagnose treat and even prevent

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
illnesses

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
it will help us improve the health of

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
our planet as we develop solutions to

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
combat

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
climate change food shortages and

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
resource constraints

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,040
and behind all of that is the open

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,520
source community a community that

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,159
of course many of you watching today are

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
a critical part of

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
in order to support this growth to

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
maintain the software that we already

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
have

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,520
and create the software of the future we

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
need the open source community to grow

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,119
too

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,560
we need more developers more maintainers

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,720
and more contributors

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
to meet the ever increasing demands for

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,079
software

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
it's basically more more of it all i

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,439
guess

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
and what's amazing is how quickly we're

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,479
already seeing this happen

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,119
so how do we the existing open source

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
community

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
support this growth how do we pave a

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
path for new developers and ensure the

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,479
innovation

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,479
and quality of this community continues

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,320
to grow along with its size

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,680
how do we give some of the tireless

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,200
maintainers out there

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,280
a much deserved break to support the

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
continued growth and health of open

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,319
source

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,399
we need to create an open source culture

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,800
where anyone can be a contributor

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,040
and grow to be a maintainer we need to

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
continue to unleash the network effects

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,879
of every commit

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,000
and perhaps most significantly we need

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,080
to enable local

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
and global commercial opportunity

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,000
through open source

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,520
first let's talk about contributors and

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
the importance of open source

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
development

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,239
as a viable career path today

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
there are over 50 million developers on

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
github

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
in five years we expect that number to

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
double

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
that's a hundred million developers who

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
are going to be critical to the

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
acceleration of human progress in the

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
coming decades

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,480
they're going to come from all over the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,239
world but especially from developing

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,160
nations where learning to code and

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
contributing to open source

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
is a path to economic growth and

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,159
prosperity

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
this is a map of where in the world

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,440
contributions on github are happening

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
today

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,920
five years ago the majority of open

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,440
source contributions were being made in

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,239
the western world

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,959
over time we start to see more and more

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,040
regions growing in terms of contributors

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
and now you can see that the epicenter

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,519
of open source contribution is actually

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,159
moving away from the western world

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
as we move into the future we see places

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,360
like

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
india china africa and latin america

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
really start to light up

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
just check out the map there is an

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
acceleration happening

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
in open source contributions from

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
outside the western world

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
and this is going to intensify over the

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
next five to ten years

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
i'm going to share a stat that still

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,200
boggles my mind my son is seven

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,799
and in his lifetime eighty percent of

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
the world population

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,360
will reside in asia and africa the

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
developing world is really going to

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720
drive a lot of the innovation and

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
progress we're going to see in the next

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
few decades and the world

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
is going to be richer more dynamic and

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
more inclusive because of this

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,159
interconnected open source community

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
that we're all continuing to build

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,920
together

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,400
let's zoom into the impact that open

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,400
source can have on someone's life

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
this is sonia john a blockchain

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
developer writer and speaker in kenya

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
who recently participated in the github

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,120
read me project

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,440
she was 25 when hyperinflation hit south

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
sudan and she lost her job and 90

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
percent of her savings

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
she felt like she had lost everything

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,280
and was starting to get desperate

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
in her own words she moved to kenya

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,720
bought a cheap laptop and installed

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
ubuntu because that's what she had heard

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
programmers do

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,479
and taught herself how to code she

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
didn't have a degree in computer science

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
or an internship with a software company

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,600
she had a laptop and she had

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
determination

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,120
the first time someone offered to pay

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
her for a project she just didn't

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
believe it

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,759
but she built a messenger bot earned her

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
first paycheck as a developer and

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
discovered the enormous opportunity that

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
had opened up to her

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,560
sonia's story is so inspiring there are

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,400
brilliant gifted people all over the

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
world right now who haven't unlocked

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,199
their potential to contribute to open

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
source

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,960
as we look ahead to the dramatic rise in

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
software development that is coming in

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,479
the next five years and beyond

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
we need to seek out these folks and

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,880
create a path to open source

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,960
contribution

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,039
and in turn financial opportunity

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
we need to make it possible for talented

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,759
developers to have a thriving

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
successful career in open source to get

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
paid for their work

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
to grow their careers and contribute

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
their talent to a space where it has the

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
potential to have

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
enormous impact i'll share some thoughts

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,199
on some specific ways that you can help

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
with this a bit later

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
we've seen what kind of opportunity open

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
source can bring to one person

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
let's now flip that and look at this

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
from the other perspective

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240
let's look at the network effect of a

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,319
single commit to an open source project

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,120
for this example we picked a commit to

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,520
tensorflow in june of 2020.

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
this is a real contribution contributed

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,840
by a single developer

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
that commit helps improve tensorflow

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
which we know is being used widely

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,720
around the globe

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,759
in the four months that have passed

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
since it was made more than 4500

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
developers from over a hundred countries

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
have worked directly on the tensorflow

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,840
project

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,840
but this is only the tip of the iceberg

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
let's now look at all of the projects

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
that have leveraged and directly depend

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
on this version of tensorflow

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
that single commit is now included in

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
about

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,039
23 500 projects on github

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
anchored in 137 countries around the

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
world

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039
and so far it has been included in the

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,400
work of more than 50

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,000
000 developers from 151 countries

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,319
the reach of a single commit is

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
incredible this is the compounding

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
effect of a single contribution

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
think about the exponential impact a

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
single developer can have in their

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
career

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
multiply that by 100 million and just

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
imagine

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
what this community can do it honestly

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,919
gives me goosebumps to think about the

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,919
magnitude of what can be achieved

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
i love this example of just what commit

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,000
can lead to

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
this is evan yu another maintainer who

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,639
participated in the github readme

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,800
project

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
he started an open source project called

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
vue with the intention of building a

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,199
simple javascript library that he could

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,280
reference to improve his own efficiency

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
he never intended to be a full-time open

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,639
source maintainer but

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
you can get where this is going that's

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
exactly what he does today

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,240
when he open sourced the project people

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
started using it

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,639
the community adapted his idea built on

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
it and ultimately helped it evolved into

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
a thriving global community of

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,319
maintainers

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,240
contributors and users one thing i love

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,319
about vue is that evan's vision for the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
project is to give any user a low

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,759
barrier of entry a good foundation and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
room to grow

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
he said that the ideal user is someone

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
who just got into web development and

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
they're intentionally designing a way

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,520
for folks to start building without

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
having an

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,240
understanding of how front-end

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,800
development actually works

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,960
it's this mindset that can have a huge

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
impact on lowering the barrier of entry

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,039
for new developers to open source

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
if you began with the foundation of a

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,639
single contributor

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
and has evolved to become an integral

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,280
part of developer workflows

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,240
and best of all it's now fully funded by

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,840
the community

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,520
it serves i told you about sony and john

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,519
earlier and she said something that i

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,760
think is so insightful

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
she said when i'm building solutions and

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
decide to keep them closed i recognize

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
that this removes an

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,680
opportunity for somebody else so most of

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
my work is open source

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,880
the potential the community is

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,200
absolutely massive

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,160
and every project every commit is a

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
building block

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,560
that the next 50 million developers will

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
be able to learn from and build on

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
so we all need to focus on getting more

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
people to that first commit

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,519
because of course that's where it all

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
starts

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,440
so we've talked about the impact that

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
open source can have on sony in other

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,399
people's lives

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
and we've talked about the value of a

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
commit so

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,959
let's talk a little bit about money the

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
growth of open source community has

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,680
real economic impact according to the

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,160
corn ferry institute

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,160
demand for skilled workers will outstrip

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,560
supply in the next 10 years

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,600
resulting in a global talent shortage of

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,839
more than 85.2 million people

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
if left unchecked the financial impact

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,279
of this talent shortage could reach more

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,480
than 8.4 trillion

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,800
in unrealized annual revenue by 2030.

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
this is equivalent to the combined gdps

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,320
of germany and japan

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
obviously these numbers are for a

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
broader group than just developers this

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
is

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
all skilled workers but an increasing

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
number of these jobs will require

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
technical fluency if not straight coding

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,360
skills

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,600
open source will play a key role in

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
closing this gap and in doing so has the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,560
power to help accelerate emerging

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,240
economies

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
let's take a look at one incredibly

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,720
inspiring program related

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
to this laboratory is a social

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
entrepreneurship program in latin

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,440
america that trains women who have been

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,000
unable to start careers

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,760
in web development or ux design the

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
organization then connects these women

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
with companies

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
and helps them launch a career in tech

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,200
since its inception

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,519
laboratoria has trained over 1600 women

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
and

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,880
78 of them have started technology

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
careers in 17 industries

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
that kind of success can have a huge

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,880
impact on a local

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,320
economy here's the story of one woman

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
whose life was changed thanks to

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,519
laboratoria

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,279
chireni azkaraga is from puebla mexico

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
she had to leave a career in music that

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,000
she loved she started walking and

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
training neighbors

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
dogs to make a living in order to

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
support her family

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,440
she applied and was accepted to the

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
laboratoria training program where she

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
trained as a ux

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,040
designer she's now a web developer who

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
draws on her experience in the arts and

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
in dog training to guide users through a

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,880
well-orchestrated application experience

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
for the program

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
i share this story because there are

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
several things that i talked about today

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
that form the bigger picture of the

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,480
opportunity ahead

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,399
we need the next 50 million developers

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
to continue to carry the open source

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
community forward

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
and to create the software we'll all

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
depend on in the future

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,399
there's so much untapped talent all over

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the world and so many people are seeking

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
opportunities to improve their

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,360
lives through professional achievement

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,360
financially or often both

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
that talent has the potential to have

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,920
lasting positive impact

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
not only on the lives of individuals but

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,360
on innovation

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
and economic growth both locally and

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,480
more broadly

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,040
but together we must continue to remove

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
barriers

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
in major league hacking's most recent

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200
hacker census

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
which is a survey of almost a hundred

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
thousand collegiate hackathon

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
participants

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
nearly 62 percent of respondents said

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
that they had not contributed to open

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,279
source yet

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,000
among them close to 92 percent believe

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
that contributing

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
to open source in the future will be

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
important for their career

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,680
the main thing holding them back is that

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
they feel like they don't know how to

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
get started

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,959
or that they aren't skilled enough

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,160
organizations like laboratoria and the

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
vue project are doing

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,000
amazing work bringing more people into

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
tech and open source

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
and lowering the barriers to getting

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
started there are so many ways that we

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
can all get involved

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
in paving the way for new developers to

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,600
join the open source community

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,639
i picked a few great examples but this

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
is far from an

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
exhaustive list google summer of code

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
which i'm sure

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
virtually all of you have heard of by

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
now is a program focused on bringing

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
more student developers from around the

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,959
world to open source

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
outreachy organizes three-month paid

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,160
internships with free

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
and open source software projects for

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
people who are typically

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
underrepresented in those projects

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,639
open collective gives open source

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,360
projects a transparent way to collect

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,680
funding and manage their finances

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,079
community bridge brings together project

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
maintainers contributors and users to

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,560
fund open source projects

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,079
improve code security and boost the size

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,079
and diversity of open source communities

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,560
of course at github we have github

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,720
sponsors which enables companies and

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,160
individuals to sponsor projects or

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
specific developers

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,680
making open source careers possible for

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
contributors

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
i'd encourage everyone to consider

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
sponsoring an individual or a team

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
that's doing work that's important to

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,560
you

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
the major league hacking fellowship

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,399
provides educational curriculum

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
and practical experience that new

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,440
developers can put on their resumes

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
right away companies can sponsor fellows

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
to work on specific

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,959
projects within their organization or

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
open source projects in general

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,399
to help more people enter into careers

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,800
as developers

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,160
these projects and platforms are always

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
seeking supporters

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,680
financial sponsors and mentors to fuel

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,360
their growth

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,519
so i encourage you to get involved in

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,279
one or more if you're not already

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
whether that's shining a light on the

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,360
incredible work that they do

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,360
supporting them financially or acting as

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
a mentor for folks going through their

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
programs

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,440
in addition think about the global

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
nature of the developer community

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
build your projects and your communities

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,199
with the needs of developers around the

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
world in mind

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
do you need to change anything for your

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,360
software to be useful for folks

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,560
in emerging economies and mobile first

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,279
markets

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,800
what about places without fast internet

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
what about your community

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,959
is it welcoming to new developers those

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,920
from different backgrounds and parts of

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
the world

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,480
and of course how do you think about

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,959
accessibility to be available and useful

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
for as many folks as possible i know

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,639
there's lots of food for thought here

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
and a ton of great talks out there by

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,360
others

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
on details around building our projects

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,399
and communities to be more inclusive and

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,920
accessible

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,920
so i encourage you to take a look at

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
those

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,680
what started with a small group of

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,000
academics and researchers back

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
in the 50s and 60s and led to the free

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
software movement in the 80s and the

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,680
launch of the open source movement in

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
the 90s is now a community

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,240
of 50 million people whose efforts and

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,600
contributions have helped

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,800
define the world as we know it today

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,240
because of you the pace of new software

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,759
is blazingly fast with components for

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,040
almost anything readily available

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,759
because of you there is an abundance of

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
exceptionally high quality software

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,560
freely available

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,120
for everyone to use and to build on

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,600
and because of you people around the

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,160
world can learn from the vast array of

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
knowledge

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,839
and best practices shared openly helping

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,199
pave the way

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,160
for new contributors to open source

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,440
it took decades to grow the community to

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,839
this size

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,639
with your help in just the next few

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,800
years

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
we'll pave the way for the next 50

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,720
million developers

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
so that open source can continue to be a

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
key source of innovation

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,240
global collaboration and an engine of

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,880
human progress

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,000
here's to being a hundred million strong

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,839
thanks for all you do

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,839
and thanks for being here today

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
