Abstract: For those who are underrepresented in tech, navigating code reviews can be hard. For example, a study of Github code reviews show that people are much more critical of code when they know itâ€™s submitted by a woman. Software Architect, Angie Jones, will share the 10 guidelines she follows for navigating code reviews, which have worked for every code base she has contributed to. These practical tips will help lead to a productive process that will help you get your code accepted faster, and without the drama.
