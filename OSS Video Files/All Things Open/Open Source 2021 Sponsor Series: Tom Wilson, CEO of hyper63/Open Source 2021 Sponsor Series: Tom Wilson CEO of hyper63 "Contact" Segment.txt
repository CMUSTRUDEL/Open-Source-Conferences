Why we love hyper63

In short, it solves a real problem we hear about all the time. Developers spend nearly half their time on maintenance, bugs, product upkeep, etc.  Hyper63 reduces complexity by separating business logic (the secret sauce) from general services (databases, caching, search, etc.) and enables a focus on the business solution - not the moving parts. The result is happier developers, faster production, and higher product quality.
