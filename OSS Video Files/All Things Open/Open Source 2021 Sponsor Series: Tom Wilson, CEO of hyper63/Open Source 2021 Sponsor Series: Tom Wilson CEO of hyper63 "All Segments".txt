5. About Tom

Why we love hyper63

In short, it solves a real problem we hear about all the time. Developers spend nearly half their time on maintenance, bugs, product upkeep, etc.  Hyper63 reduces complexity by separating business logic (the secret sauce) from general services (databases, caching, search, etc.) and enables a focus on the business solution - not the moving parts. The result is happier developers, faster production, and higher product quality.

hyper 63

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,880
is an open source project it's a service

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,679
and and a company but to

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
get to the problem that hyper 63 is

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
trying to solve

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
you know we look at you know here as

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
there's over 40 million developers on

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,519
github uh

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,560
that's amazing and you know

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,280
there is a real cost to development

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,000
so when you have an idea and you want to

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
put that out into the world

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
there is a cost to to build that

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
maintain that

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,960
um provide documentation for that

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,559
etcetera and one of the challenges

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,039
is that you know about

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,840
half of the time that developers spend

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
building that product creating

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,399
applications is

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,920
really spent on maintenance uh bugs

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,200
and just the constant kind of upkeep

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
of your product and you know through the

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
years

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,840
i've seen that be a real challenge over

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,960
time as a product gets successful

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,520
you're wanting to keep keep

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
more and more new features coming out

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
continue to innovate

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,759
but but you also have this law

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
or this challenge in productivity

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
because of the complexity

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
and really hyper 63 is part of that

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
solution

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
it's helping development teams you know

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
really separate their business logic or

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,439
their secret sauce in an application

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
from you know kind of the general

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,840
services

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,680
uh like a database or a caching solution

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
or a search solution

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
really hyper 63's goal is to create this

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
boundary so that

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,719
that separation basically you're

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,439
you're focused on providing business

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
value

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
and solving the business problem without

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,840
thinking about

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,360
you know kind of the the moving parts

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
and i think that that's a really

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
important

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,800
and and valuable ad for

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
developer happiness um but also

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
uh the business because they're they're

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
able to

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,120
move faster and and basically

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,680
create a better quality product

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
and and the developers are able to focus

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,840
on

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
constantly innovating on that product

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,879
so this is a demo a little tour of hyper

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,160
hyper 63 tour repo is on github

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,200
and you can look at this uh repo

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
and actually follow along uh on on this

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
tour on your own

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
um but for today just because i have a

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,680
couple of minutes of time i'm just going

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,519
to go through

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,640
a couple of features of hyper 63.

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,959
specifically the data and the search

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,400
so every application needs to store

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,280
structured data

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
and instead of making a decision whether

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
you want to use

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,319
mysql or postgres or mongodb

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
what hyper 63 does is removes that

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,799
decision from you

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,280
you just uh connect to a data service

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
and you give it your database name in

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
this case

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
open source 101 dash movie and then you

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
just

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,760
run a put to that and so we're going to

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,400
do that

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
and when we hit save we're going to get

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
ok

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,440
true and our

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,959
database is created so now we can add

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,200
some documents to that

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
without setting up tables or doing

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
migrations

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,799
we just post a document to that database

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,080
and we can just run

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
a post with slash data and the name of

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
our database

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,360
and give it a document in this case

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,680
we're going to use ghostbusters

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
and ghostbusters is just a document

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,959
object with a title

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,760
a year and a genre so we'll just hit

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
save and we'll see that that's saved to

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,440
our database

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,400
we'll go ahead and add a couple more

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
we'll add

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,360
um groundhog day we just had groundhog

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,440
day by the way that was

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,440
a fun movie you've never seen

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
that movie i'd definitely recommend it

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,000
and then we'll add

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,919
avengers another great movie

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
so we've added a couple of documents to

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,960
our database and we can

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
see those documents by just doing a get

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280
on our database

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
and that should show all the documents

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,240
that we have

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,840
nice and easy and we can

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,400
pull just the documental array

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
by just adding docs to the end of that

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,639
and

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,080
now build a search index

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,440
um so instead of going and you know

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,039
building up a search cluster using

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
elasticsearch or

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,520
kendra or any other search project we've

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
got that built in

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,800
and again it's a distraction away so to

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,000
build a search engine

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,280
in hyper 63 it's just another put

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,320
we just add a put and instead of data

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,800
we specify search and

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,880
um there's one piece we have to add to

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
it that i always forget is we got to

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
tell it

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
what fields we want to search on so we

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,120
do

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,680
fields and we'll say title

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,720
and near and now we've got our search

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
database

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
and we can go and just uh

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
add some documents to it so we're going

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
to do

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,880
a wait and to add documents we'll do a

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,120
post

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,759
and we'll say search

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,960
and then we're going to add to our rest

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,319
endpoint

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,160
a command underscore

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,400
bulk and this is just going to say you

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,639
know what we want to put

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:27,280
more than one document in the database

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,639
or the search index um

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,120
right now so we're gonna add our

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
docs and we need to get those docs so

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,600
we'll

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,800
un comment out this command here

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,840
and we get the docs and now we should uh

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,280
add those docs to our

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,120
search index and then the last piece

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,240
is we want to be able to search by

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,440
uh giving it some text so

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,639
we just um call a query command

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,039
on our search index so await

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,039
post

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,240
search and then slash ser

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
query

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
and then we pass in an object in that

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,160
object

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:24,479
we have a query property and we'll say

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,479
ghost busters

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
and once we save that we get a search

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
back

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
and matches and it's a search engine so

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,319
it'll give us a score

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,440
of the relevancy for each match and just

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
to

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
make sure that everything works we can

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
also um

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,000
search on near as well and get that back

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
so that's a short demo i hope you can

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,759
kind of see

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
you know really one of the core design

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
goals

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
is just simplicity and the ability to

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,720
keep

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,639
your business rules business logic

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
separate from implementation so you

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,160
don't have to care if that

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,560
is google behind the scenes kendra or

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,840
elasticsearch you're just wanting your

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,360
app to be able to search

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,000
as far as you know the types of

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
things we can do the services we we

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,440
provide

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,160
hyper 63 as a service but it's also an

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,160
open source

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
product so you can pull the source code

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
down and run

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
in your own infrastructure on your own

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,919
cloud and

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
we can work with you to do that to build

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,719
adapters to
