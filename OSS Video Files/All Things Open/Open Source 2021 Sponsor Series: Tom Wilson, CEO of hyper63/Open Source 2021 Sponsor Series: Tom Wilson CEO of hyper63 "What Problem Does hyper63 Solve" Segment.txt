Why we love hyper63

In short, it solves a real problem we hear about all the time. Developers spend nearly half their time on maintenance, bugs, product upkeep, etc.  Hyper63 reduces complexity by separating business logic (the secret sauce) from general services (databases, caching, search, etc.) and enables a focus on the business solution - not the moving parts. The result is happier developers, faster production, and higher product quality.

	00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,679
hyper 63

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,880
is an open source project it's a service

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,679
and and a company but to

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
get to the problem that hyper 63 is

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
trying to solve

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
you know we look at you know here as

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
there's over 40 million developers on

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,519
github uh

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,560
that's amazing and you know

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,280
there is a real cost to development

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,000
so when you have an idea and you want to

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
put that out into the world

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
there is a cost to to build that

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
maintain that

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,960
um provide documentation for that

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,559
etcetera and one of the challenges

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,039
is that you know about

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,840
half of the time that developers spend

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
building that product creating

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,399
applications is

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,920
really spent on maintenance uh bugs

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,200
and just the constant kind of upkeep

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
of your product and you know through the

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
years

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,840
i've seen that be a real challenge over

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,960
time as a product gets successful

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,520
you're wanting to keep keep

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
more and more new features coming out

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
continue to innovate

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,759
but but you also have this law

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
or this challenge in productivity

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
because of the complexity

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
and really hyper 63 is part of that

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
solution

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
it's helping development teams you know

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
really separate their business logic or

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,439
their secret sauce in an application

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
from you know kind of the general

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,840
services

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,680
uh like a database or a caching solution

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
or a search solution

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
really hyper 63's goal is to create this

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
boundary so that

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,719
that separation basically you're

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,439
you're focused on providing business

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
value

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
and solving the business problem without

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,840
thinking about

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,360
you know kind of the the moving parts

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
and i think that that's a really

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
important

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,800
and and valuable ad for

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
developer happiness um but also

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
uh the business because they're they're

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
able to

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,120
move faster and and basically

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,680
create a better quality product

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
and and the developers are able to focus

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,840
on

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
