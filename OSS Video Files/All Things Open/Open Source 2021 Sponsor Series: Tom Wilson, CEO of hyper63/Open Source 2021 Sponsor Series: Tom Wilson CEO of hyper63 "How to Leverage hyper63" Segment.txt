Why we love hyper63

In short, it solves a real problem we hear about all the time. Developers spend nearly half their time on maintenance, bugs, product upkeep, etc.  Hyper63 reduces complexity by separating business logic (the secret sauce) from general services (databases, caching, search, etc.) and enables a focus on the business solution - not the moving parts. The result is happier developers, faster production, and higher product quality.

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,320
as far as

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,800
um you know the types of things we can

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
do

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
the services we we provide hyper 63 as a

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,960
service

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,960
but it's also an open source product so

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,119
you can pull the source code down

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
and run in your own infrastructure on

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,519
your own cloud

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,720
and we can work with you to do that

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,000
to build adapters to you know specific

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,840
um you know services that you may use

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,120
or prefer to use um with hyper 63

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
again there are several ways that we can

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
work with you

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,480
to um what i like to say future proof

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,079
your product right

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,879
so build the the component so that

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,199
you can make the right decision now but

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,160
also have the opportunity to make

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,239
a um another decision in the future on

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,280
how to scale and grow your product

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:06,960
without losing or having to rewrite
