Title: Designing for chaos: The design process behind Olivero - Jared Ponchot & Jennifer Witkowski
Publication date: 2020-12-17
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Design UI UX Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Jared Ponchot & Jennifer Witkowski, Lullabot
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Design/UI/UX Track

Abstract: Olivero is a core initiative to create a new default theme for Drupal 9. Designing a core theme presents unique challenges as compared to designing traditional websites.

This talk will tell the story of what it’s like to design a theme for an open source content management system (CMS) and will answer questions like:

- What is Olivero, and why did we create it?
- What are the challenges of designing for an open source community made up of thousands of stakeholders?
- What compromises were made to make the design accessible?
- What are the challenges of designing for a CMS that will be used for a wide variety of sites?
- What approaches and methods did we use to do this successfully?
 
Throughout this session, we’ll walk through real-world methods and processes. We’ll discuss each stage, from the first conceptual “zoom mocks” to the various ideas along the way that never saw the light of day!

it's

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,440
nice to be here uh i'm jared panchat uh

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
and my colleague jen wikowski is also

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,960
going to be speaking

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,960
um we've we're both designers uh as you

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
said at a company called lullabot we're

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,279
where we've been working together

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,359
now for several years actually um

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,480
lullabot is a strategy design and

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,119
development agency

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
it with a legacy of expertise in drupal

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,880
and large-scale

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
cms projects these days we sort of

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
specialize in

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
problems of the intersection of

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,160
large-scale content management and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
design

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,559
systems work and if you're not familiar

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,320
with drupal which

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,000
is going to be at least a part of what

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
we're we're talking about here

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
drupal is an open source cms it's been

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,719
around since

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,879
2001 uh it's known by many as sort of

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,559
as a content management framework as

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,719
much as a cms because it's

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,800
very very flexible sort of like legos

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
for building the web

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
and it's known for being able to handle

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
complex content models

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,920
uh it's one of the first content

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
management systems that took a very

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
content-centric as opposed to a

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,400
page-centric

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,799
approach to to websites

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
drupal has what's called themes which is

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
what powers like

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
what a site looks like and how things

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,320
are templated and

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,439
laid out and styled and all that and

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
drupal has

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,680
a default theme it's called bartik it

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
was a project that start was started by

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,880
jen

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
simmons and that project started about

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
10 years ago actually so the out of the

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
box theme in drupal

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,240
is a design that's 10 years old

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
currently

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
um these are my colleagues putra

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
and mike putra bonacorsi and mike

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
herschel they're both

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,479
front-end developers in their background

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
at least

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
putri is now a technical project manager

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,880
at lullabot as well

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
but they actually came up with the idea

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,159
for this project early on uh they were

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,159
having a conversation

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,399
at drupalcon seattle which is sort of

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,200
the annual american conference

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,640
that happens for the drupal community

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
and they were having a conversation

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,239
about what constitutes a great cms theme

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,599
uh and that conversation led putra and

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
mike to wonder

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,840
at the fact that there was no project

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
going on to create a new

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
theme as drupal 9 was being in

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
development so

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
that got them started and then also at

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
that drupal con

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
dress boyhart who's the founder of

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,800
drupal

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,800
he's the project lead he gives an annual

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,920
keynote address and in his keynote he

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
talked about

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,480
how uh while experts still love drupal

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
beginners or cms newcomers especially

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,360
still have some negative connotations

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
and a key aspect of that is just the

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,239
fact that the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
out of the box experience includes a

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
theme design that's a decade old

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,599
um so putri and mike started creating a

00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
few just

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,879
really simple goals what got them

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,680
excited about maybe working on a new

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,000
theme

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
and they captured those they talked

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
about having an updated modern design

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
they wanted a theme that felt

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,599
more current uh potentially could last

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,599
for another five years

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,360
they wanted functionality in the theme

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,599
that could support drupal's new features

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
that have emerged over the last decade

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,519
and above all actually they wanted

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
top-notch accessibility compliance

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
drupal now has

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
very stringent standards for

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
accessibility and they wanted to make

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
sure that drupal's default theme

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
met those standards so that got them

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
thinking that they needed to

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
pull a team together to work on it they

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
reached out to jen

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,239
jen reached out to me and away we went

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
we started the process and jen and i

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,920
began pretending like we knew how to do

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,319
a theme project for a large-scale cms

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
the work that jen and i typically do is

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,360
for clients

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
and so this was a different kind of an

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,239
undertaking so

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
this talk we're going to attempt to

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,519
answer a handful of things we're gonna

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,640
first who are we why did we do this how

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
did we do this

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,920
what would we say we did hear and then

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
um and also you're all the way here

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
already so this is good news

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,519
um and we're going to try to leave some

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,359
space at the end to hopefully answer

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,959
some questions if you have any

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,639
um i want to start by framing just

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
some of the unique challenges that we

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,919
faced right out of the gate

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
um so two key questions among others for

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,960
any design

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
project especially with client projects

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,800
like what we typically work on is

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
who's the audience we're designing for

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
and who are our stakeholders

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
they're fundamental things that any

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,960
design process

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
that we take on you know we have to have

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
these answers

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
typically it's not actually hard to

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
answer this for the kinds of projects we

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,560
do but when you're

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
designing a theme that anyone can use

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
for nearly any kind of site that they're

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,680
making

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,400
with an open source cms how you define

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,199
things like

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,199
the audience you're designing for and

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,800
what approval processes will look like

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,840
and that kind of stuff is

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,039
tricky to say the least how you solve

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
for this can create

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,840
new problems in your process and there

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
are two potentially alluring approaches

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
uh to this problem that are actually

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
each

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
problematic so i want to talk about

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,000
those and kind of why we were trying to

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,880
avoid them

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
the first problematic approach is just

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
to try to include

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,000
everything for anyone thereby making it

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,520
unwieldy and unusable for everyone

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
we knew we couldn't just include

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
everything the needs are too varied

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
and we wanted to find some way to have

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,600
some focus as we began creating

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759
together the second problematic approach

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
is to design for the average and then

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,520
thereby wind up

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
designing for no one specifically it's

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
sometimes known as the average man

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
problem and if you're not familiar with

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,360
this

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
you know back in world war ii we came to

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
grips with the fact that we had spent

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,360
decades designing and building

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,919
aircraft uh cockpits and controls for

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
what

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,479
the air force was calling the average

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
man uh there's a really great back story

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,319
to this it's fascinating it goes way

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,720
back to the first astronomers and

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
the american civil war and uh if you're

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
interested that

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,080
there's a podcast called 99 visible they

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
have an episode called on average that

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
tells that story there's also a great

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
book

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
called the end of average really

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,199
fascinating stuff but

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,960
to sum it up by world war ii what

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
the air force began realizing was that

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,639
they were taking

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
the averages of all air force personnel

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,919
to

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
do approximations of things like the

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
average

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
height weight arm length etc and they

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,639
had actually designed and built airplane

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,479
cockpits around this

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
but it turned out that no one pilot

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,240
actually matched any of these averages

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,319
and it led to design thinking behind

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
modern cockpits that we have now where

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
now we have things like adjustable seats

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,440
and yokes and pedals

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
they didn't actually have that in these

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,199
planes they were having lots of planes

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,199
go down in world war ii because of this

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
actually

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
in designing aloe vera we also had to

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
figure out

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,720
um what features and controls would need

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
to be adjustable if you will

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
um so what was our approach so jen's

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
going to get into more specifics in

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
terms of the actual things that we did

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,680
and i'm going to try to really quickly

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
just talk about our high level approach

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
and philosophy

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,039
so first we established some design

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
principles

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
this helped us define success in a way

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
that was

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
easy to remember and could hold true

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
almost regardless of what we learned

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
about our audience and stakeholders as

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,919
we went along

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
and our principles were pretty simple we

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
wanted to above all have something that

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,039
was simple

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,199
we wanted to avoid unnecessary visual

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,400
elements colors effects and complex

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,759
complexity we wanted something modern

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,919
something that would take advantage of

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
the capabilities and strengths of modern

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
browsers

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,720
that were definitely not being leveraged

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,560
in a 10 year old theme

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
we wanted something focused so we wanted

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
to embrace high contrast

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,639
saturated color negative space and draw

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,680
the eye to what's most important

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
design defaults for the 80 percent and

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
we wanted something flexible

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,039
uh we wanted to provide options and

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
overrides to account for varied needs

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,319
and preferences

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
then we work to zero in on what could we

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,879
actually

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
say about this audience we were

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
designing for and the sites that they

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,000
would make with this theme

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
um when you're designing a default theme

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,399
for an open source cms there's an

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,680
ocean of things that you just can't know

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
about the people who are going to

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,360
eventually use the theme

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
but there were a few things we thought

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
were actually safe to say

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
so we knew that these were going to be

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,800
people who were probably new to drupal

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,560
we knew that they were probably not

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,480
going to have a lot of programming or

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
design skills if they're using a default

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
out of the box themes

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
these are usually people who either

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,760
don't have the resources or skills to

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
actually

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,000
create their own and because of this

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,720
they're probably also going to be using

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
default

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
content types and whatnot that come with

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,959
drupal so they'd have a simpler content

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
model

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,200
but despite all that they were going to

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,519
have varied content so the length of

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,720
things like titles and labels and

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
in different languages and the sort of

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
number of menu items these kinds of

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,440
things could vary wildly

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,040
so next we work to try to figure out who

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
the stakeholders were how would the

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
design process work

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,720
we needed to answer questions like who

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
are our stakeholders who's going to

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
provide

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,560
feedback when and how what do we want

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
from them like what kind of feedback are

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
we looking for from them and can these

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,399
people provide it

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
and what will approval look like you

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,320
know who's going to approve which

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,399
designs and how

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
i already mentioned the challenge of our

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
real stakeholders being lots of people

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,519
with

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,399
uh all kinds of needs that we couldn't

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,959
know who would eventually use the theme

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
and a broad drupal community as well

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
drupal has a massive community of

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,320
developers who contribute to it as a lot

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,240
of open source projects do

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
but we need to figure out some way to

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
rein this in a bit

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
so our approach was to first establish a

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
proxy group

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,000
we assembled a group of various core

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
maintainers who had

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,920
a lot of knowledge around different

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,640
aspects of what could get into drupal

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
core

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
as well as some designers and developers

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
who were willing to work on the project

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,839
with us

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
and these were people who could help us

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
review and refine

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
at the beginning of the process so the

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,320
goal here was to do as much

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,399
due diligence as possible to weed out as

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,480
many potential issues with our design

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
ideas as possible so that we could put

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
something

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
a bit more refined in front of the

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,480
larger community for feedback

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,320
the next we just tested and continued to

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
iterate we had a lot of help from this

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
proxy group with things like

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,320
accessibility testing along the way and

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
we were able to do a lot of refinement

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
and weed out a lot of problems

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
before we wasted a broader community's

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,560
time with these kinds of things

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
and we knew we wanted to eventually

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
engage the broader community for

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,040
feedback

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,640
so we worked to define the kind of

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,399
feedback we were looking for

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,399
and then what our timeline targets were

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,440
going to be before we actually

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,360
published it to the whole community

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
once we'd done a good bit of refinement

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
in the design process and

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,480
defined the kind of feedback we were

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
looking for from the broader community

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
we published our progress

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,320
we did this on drupal.org which is kind

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,240
of where the community goes to

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,000
hash things out and uh we began

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
iterating based on the feedback that

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,040
trickled in

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
one thing that felt like a real success

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,880
was that the community feedback

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,720
didn't feel like some onslaught of

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,160
problems and bugs and complaints

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,079
it was actually pretty straightforward

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
and the community provided really great

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
insights and helped catch a few things

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
that

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,519
hadn't been caught and helped our

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,000
designs get closer to done

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
so that was kind of a flyover of some of

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,160
the key challenges we faced in our

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,920
overarching process but

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
the really fun stuff is what we actually

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
did within that process

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
like how did we identify the look and

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
feel we wanted to achieve and how did we

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
collaborate

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
to refine and establish that look and

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,760
feel and and what were the designs like

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,680
along the way so

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,200
now for the more exciting part my

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
colleague jenn witkowski is going to

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
jump in

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,160
and actually share some of those details

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
so this is where it gets fun

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,760
jen do you want to hear let me try to

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,639
stop the screen share and pass it over

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,320
to you

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,760
yeah hi everyone um so let me

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
share my keynote here

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
awesome i hope everybody's seen my

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,839
screen

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,000
um okay so

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,680
uh let's talk a little bit about the

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
design process

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,399
um i'd love to walk you through how we

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,480
approach the visual design for aloe vera

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,760
and how we finalized the design system

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
so our big question was what are we

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,920
designing

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,160
what did the theme have to do

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,519
so it was important for us to understand

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
the scope and restrictions of the

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,079
project

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,839
and what we could change versus things

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,360
that were nice to have versus things we

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,600
couldn't even touch

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
and we worked closely with developers

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,480
specifically mike and putra

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,440
to achieve this so what we did is we

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,120
created a list

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
that captured all the components and

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
reviewed them with developers to fully

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
understand what we could

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
and could not change we also captured

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
all the different ways that the

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,279
components could appear

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,920
so what we did is we started off with

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
bartik

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,320
as a base and we went in and took a

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,560
bunch of screenshots of all the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
components that appear in bartik

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,079
and we assembled them into a document

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
and then went through

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,639
each component and discussed whether or

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
not it had to be included in the design

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
system

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
uh it was nothing fancy we actually used

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,480
a dropbox paper dock

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
as you can see here but it helped us

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,800
better understand

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,480
what we were overall designing for once

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
we had the list of components

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
what we did is we created really quick

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,519
wireframes

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
to review with my computer just to

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,800
ensure that we had captured

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
all the important bits that came out of

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,399
our discussion

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,720
so once we felt like we were in a good

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
place with component documentation

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
uh we were able to start the visual

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,920
phase uh

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,240
one thing to note is that we were our

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,600
proxy group or our stakeholders

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
i may go back and forth between

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
stakeholders and proxy group

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,639
but our proxy group they were across

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,920
multiple time zones

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,720
they already had pretty full days and we

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
also had a pretty aggressive deadline so

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
we had to shorten the visual research

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
phase

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,600
by prioritizing what the big questions

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,440
were and shortening the amount of time

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
of design reviews that we had with our

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
proxy group

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
so the big question was what should the

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
new

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,839
theme look like um we worked closely

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
with our stakeholders to help answer

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,199
this question

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
and since we didn't have a lot of time

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,079
to spend on answering this question

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
we used an exercise called the spectrum

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,959
analysis

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
exercise where stakeholders could

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,720
complete this in their own time

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,480
by a specific deadline

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,880
so you may be asking yourself well what

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,040
is a spectrum analysis exercise

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,399
um well it's a great exercise that our

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
team uses to help

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
figure out what the client is thinking

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,560
when it comes to the voice and tone

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,079
look and feel of a website or in this

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
case the theme

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,199
so what you do is you create a sliding

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,120
scale on

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
one end is an adjective that can

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,399
describe the look and feel

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,160
of the site and on the other end is

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,360
another adjective that usually conflicts

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,880
with the first

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
for example at the top here we have

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,560
formal and casual

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,399
one thing to note is that this exercise

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
only works if both adjectives are

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,639
positive if you put a negative adjective

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,079
up there stakeholders will avoid it

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,360
because they don't want their website

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,480
associated with

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,480
a negative adjective

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,279
so what ends up happening then is

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,120
stakeholders put a point on the scale

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,880
of how they think the design should look

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,399
and feel so if

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,160
they feel like the design should be more

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,800
formal they put the

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,320
point on the more formal side um if it's

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,000
they feel it should be more casual

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,160
they put the point on the more casual

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
side the end result

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
is that it forces stakeholders to choose

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
an adjective

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
and it helps initiate some really good

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
discussions around

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,120
that specific adjective often with this

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
exercise we find that the

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
why is more important than the actual

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,519
selection

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
and since we couldn't conduct this in

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
person

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
we used a tool called envision to

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
conduct

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,959
this exercise remotely and it ended up

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,800
being a great tool to use because

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
staker holders could just click on the

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,160
link

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,240
go to the the web page that shows the

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,520
the spectrum analysis they could put a

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
point on the scale

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
and then other designers and developers

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
and stakeholders could go in

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,720
and comment on that point and then it

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,520
got the discussion going

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,520
around the why

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,520
so based on the spectrum analysis we

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
identified the following keywords to

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,240
help establish the voice and tone

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,280
um so we had formal light and bright

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,480
contemporary

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,720
professional approachable novel

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,480
cool familiar and high contrast

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
we then took those adjectives and

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,919
combined them with our design principles

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,799
uh in order to complete our research

00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,640
documentation

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,440
once we had that complete we were able

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,360
to start exploring the visual approaches

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
uh one thing to note is that our team

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
tries to keep the design principles and

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,280
adjectives in front of mind while we're

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
designing

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
um so we'll use things like note cards

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
post-it notes

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
wipe white boards vision boards things

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
to help

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
remind us about the design principles

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,600
and voice and tone as we start exploring

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
different visual approaches

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,760
so before we actually jump in and start

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,320
on page design

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
our team uses something called zoom mox

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
to explore

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,160
different visual approaches to a design

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,640
and with the zoo mock what you do

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,600
is you create a wireframe then you

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,679
choose a small section of that wireframe

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,080
and then you start exploring style in

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,080
that specific section

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
it's an alternative to style tiles or

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,799
element collages

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
that works better for our team in our

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,559
process and usually when we create zoom

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,960
mocks we create

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,080
two to four zoom mocks each representing

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,520
a completely different

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,760
style or variations in a specific style

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,039
um to learn more about zumax uh there's

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
an article that i wrote that gets a

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
little bit more specific on what they

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
are

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,080
and how to use them

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,799
so these are the zoo mocs or some of the

00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
zoo mocks that we had created for

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,679
oliveiro

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
um we explored approaches that were a

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,480
bit more traditional like the ones you

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
see on the left

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,360
and ones that were a little bit more

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
modern like the ones you see on the

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,919
right

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,679
uh once we felt like we had these in a

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,799
good spot we reviewed them with

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,320
stakeholders

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
and they chose an approach to move

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
forward with uh with some minor

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
revisions

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,280
one thing to note is that our team

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,480
wasn't looking for an official sign off

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,559
of a finalized

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,559
style we would have been in a much

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,240
larger feedback loop that the timeline

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,520
really didn't account for

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
um what we were looking for our

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
stakeholders was more of a nudge of you

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,720
know what this is

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,320
this is uh this is a good style this is

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
something that we really like let's keep

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,640
moving forward with the specific one

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
with the understanding that the design

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
will evolve and change

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,200
as we extend it to other pages and

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,200
components

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
so once we had our zoom ox complete it

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,640
was time to start thinking about the

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,919
design

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,160
system but before i go in and

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,760
show the designs i just wanted to

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,080
mention some of the tools that we had

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,720
used to design aloe vera

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,159
our our main ui tool that we had used

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,159
was figma

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,080
figma allowed us to collaborate much

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,440
more quickly between jared and i

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,440
between developers and with stakeholders

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,799
we used zoom for conference calls where

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,320
we had to share work

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,280
we used slack for synchronous

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
communication dropbox paper for informal

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
notes

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
and then for more formal documentation

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
we use google docs

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,200
and we use when we talk about more

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,080
formal documentation we're talking about

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,880
um specific documentation that needs

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,159
more detail

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,159
like a style guide

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
i also just wanted to restate some of

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,039
the challenges that we had to keep in

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,120
mind while we were designing the system

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
accessibility was our number one

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,960
priority

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
the design had to be wk double a

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,880
accessible

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,880
we also had to balance the must-haves

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,679
versus the nice to haves

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
uh some ideas that we had uh were

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,280
fantastic in our eyes but unfortunately

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
they wouldn't have been able to be

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,720
implemented in time

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,880
we also had to keep in mind who our

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
audience was and their intention

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,840
there's a lot that they could do with

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
this theme and we wanted to give them as

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
many

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
options as possible without making it

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,960
overwhelming

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,360
and then finally typography we had to

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,919
find

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
a font that used the sio open font

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,640
license

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,600
so it was compatible with the drupal.org

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,600
distribution packaging requirements

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,280
it also had to support a wide variety of

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,360
font weights and fit

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,559
with the theme and the overall style of

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,720
feeling modern

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
uh in the end we chose metropolis for

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,520
our san serif and laura

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
for a serif font so now i'm going to

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,280
take

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,159
a small little break here and i'm going

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,520
to switch my

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,520
screen share to figma

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,320
and we're going to do a design

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,320
walkthrough here

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,640
so usually what ends up happening is if

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,640
i was giving this live

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,960
in-person session i would be actually

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,120
using for uh short video clips but there

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,440
tends to be a lag sometimes in uh

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,760
video sharing um so i'm gonna take you

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,880
live into the designs in figma and

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,280
walk you guys through everything so

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
so this is a guided tour of the designs

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,400
that we had uh created

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,799
for aloe vera um when we had first uh

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,600
started uh thinking about the design

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,640
system we focused on two main pages

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,280
um we focused on the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
default landing page so this would be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,760
the page that users would see when they

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,840
first activate aloe vera

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,520
and we also focused on a article page

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
and the reason why we chose those two

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
pages is because it gave us

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,559
two apps that entered the spectrum when

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,720
it came to content

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,320
so we could explore what a page would

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
look like with minimal content

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,039
versus what a page would look like with

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,480
a maximum amount of content

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,159
so this is the uh default of the box

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,240
experience when you first

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,159
activate the aloe vera theme uh this

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,080
would be the page that you would see

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,720
um and one of our main goals was this

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
page

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,120
was to arrange content in a way that

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,840
would get users started up much more

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,960
quickly

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
with using the theme

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,440
once we felt we had that in a good spot

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,559
we then turned our focus to an article

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,159
page

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,159
and what we did is we actually uh

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,799
created a mock uh

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
blog post that touted the new drupal 9

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
theme

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
and this allowed us to work out a ton of

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,880
different styles that we could extend

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,080
uh beyond to other parts of the system

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
including our typography how imagery

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,279
works

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,679
so the ratio size with imagery whether

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,960
or not it floats left or right

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,320
what quotations look like

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,799
tables list items tags and what a

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,720
commenting system looks like

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,159
so after we had that complete we felt

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
like we had a good portion

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,200
of our base styles um in a good spot

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,279
where we can start extending that

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,600
to other pages

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,720
our next step was to focus on the header

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
uh the header had

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,120
it included a lot of functionality and

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,840
we wanted to make sure that we were

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,799
designing

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,480
for that functionality when it came to

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,679
the out of the box experience

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,559
you could uh aloe vera came with

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
a one level drop down so we designed

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,039
that drop down to make it feel more

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
modern

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,880
uh and fit with the overall theme

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
when it came to navigation we had to

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,640
think about the types of

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,919
navigation that users would uh use with

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,000
the theme so

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,480
up here at the top here uh this is like

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,520
best case scenario right so we have five

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,000
words they're pretty short most likely

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,120
won't

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,320
won't happen when somebody activates and

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
uses this theme

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,000
we had to think about what users what

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,799
would happen with the navigation if

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
users were

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,200
to add numerous link numerous

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,200
links with different line lengths um so

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,559
instead of having navigation wrap the

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
two lines from that happen because that

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,960
can get kind of messy

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,679
um we decided to create a max width with

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,760
the

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,240
overall navigation and once that

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,760
navigation hits that max width

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,760
it would actually wrap up into a

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
hamburger nav um

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,880
and then you click the hamburger nav and

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,200
then you can get

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,880
your navigation appears um so this would

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,159
allow a little bit more flexibility with

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
navigation

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,919
um and gave it more of a cleaner look if

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,159
somebody was using

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,200
you know 10 links and they all had like

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,120
10 10 characters in them

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,559
another good thing about this too is

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
that it was easy for us to take the

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,440
style

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,440
and extend it down to tablet and mobile

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,760
one of our goals with the theme was to

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,799
make it feel more modern

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,520
and we did this with the design but also

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,360
we wanted to include some interactions

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,120
so we created this neat interaction

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,039
where on scroll down

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,279
what would happen is that the header

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,320
would actually wrap up into a hamburger

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,840
nav

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
and then the user can click that

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,080
hamburger nav at any time

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,080
to expose the header

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,919
we also had to think about branding so

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,679
users would be able to upload

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,480
different types of logos word marks or

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,400
just type in the name of their website

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,320
so we had to account for

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
what would happen with the background

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,080
depending on the type of logo that they

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,320
would upload

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,840
so we created backgrounds that would

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,919
we created lighter backgrounds that

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,039
would accommodate darker logos or word

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
marks

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,000
um and then we also have a darker

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
background option that accommodates

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,799
lighter logos

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,360
once we had that worked out we started

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
focusing on

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,480
the mobile experience and we focused on

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,919
the header

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,400
specifically first because the header

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
again

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
had a lot of functionality in it but

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
also when you

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
are on a smaller screen trying to figure

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,080
out how branding works

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,279
along with navigation can be difficult

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,400
uh so what we did

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,159
is we um we

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,080
took all the secondary items in the

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,200
navigation like the search

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,000
and login and sign up took that

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
out of the default header and actually

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,240
put that

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,039
into the exposed hamburger now so as you

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,720
see here

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,960
we have a sign up login and then the

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
search bar appears at the top

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,399
that would appear once the user clicks

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,600
on the hamburger nav to access

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,360
navigation so this would allow users to

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:48,240
have more room for

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:51,600
branding up here at the top

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,200
our next challenge was a listing page

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,360
and our main goal with the listing page

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,919
was to increase scannability

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,440
uh so what we did is we made titles

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
large and up front

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,720
and secondary content like descriptions

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,200
and

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,200
uh tags um smaller

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,760
we also had to think about the editor

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
experience

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,919
so when you're logged into drupal

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,880
the editor tabs are actually part of the

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,880
theme

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,720
and we had a lot of great ideas around

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,919
this but unfortunately they wouldn't

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,559
have been able to

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,440
be implemented in time um so what we did

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,840
is we just took

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
the default experience and restyled it

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,200
and finally there was forms forms

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,880
forms were challenging for us and the

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,080
reason why is because we

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,960
had to balance accessibility with making

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
forms feel modern and part of the actual

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
uh

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
theme design and there was a lot of back

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,279
and forth with

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,279
accessibility experts we are still going

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
back and forth with them actually

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,279
i think in the next month or two jared

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,559
and i may tackle forms again because we

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,840
got some feedback

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,960
um so there might be some slight changes

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,080
coming to forms but we also had to make

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,240
sure that we were

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,240
including things like focus dates error

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,440
messages

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
and hover states and making sure all of

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,360
the form elements were fully accessible

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
when it came to the design

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,559
so now i want to review ideas that got

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
scratched

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,919
um this is kind of like the bloopers

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,520
reel of the presentation

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,799
um but i think it's also good to show

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,880
this kind of because it kind of shows

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,720
our design process and how things

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
progressed to where they are right now

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,240
so as i had mentioned um we have our

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,880
uh default uh um editor tabs

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,520
um so these are what this is the design

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,919
that we had

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,799
actually ended up moving forward with um

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,760
but we

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,240
when we first started designing this um

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,440
we

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,640
had uh took a much darker approach to

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
the design

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
um but we got some feedback that this

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,200
was too bold

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,880
um we also experimented with what would

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,919
editor tabs look like

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,279
if they were uh if they took less of a

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,640
priority with the uh

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,679
overall page and they were uh

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,600
they were um in the lower left

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,320
or lower right hand side and they would

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,760
be pinned there

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,159
we thought that these were both really

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,960
great ideas because it gave

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,559
more of the user an idea of what the

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
page would look like without having this

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,679
bar

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,799
obtrusive bar going across the top of it

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,279
but unfortunately

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,159
uh due to the timeline we can we

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,159
couldn't develop this

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,799
sidebar um so the default theme

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,840
um so aloe vera includes a right sidebar

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,679
out of the box but uh down the road we

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
thought it would be nice if users could

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,799
float

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,559
the theme either or float the sidebar

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,120
either left or right

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,120
so what we did is we designed the

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,880
sidebar and then tested it

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,240
in both ways so what it looked like on

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,760
the right side and what it would look

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,679
like on the left side

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,679
just in case down the line they do want

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,399
to include that functionality

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,840
and when they do they would be a minimum

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,840
redesign needed for that

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,720
and then finally we have search um so

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,320
this is the search bar that we ended up

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,559
moving forward with

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,919
but when we had first started exploring

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,159
search we took a much

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,760
lighter approach to the search bar and

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,559
we got some feedback that

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,480
it felt more part of the page design and

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
didn't feel like a search bar

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,640
so what we did is we explored options

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,320
where we would uh

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,960
try and make it feel more like a search

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,320
bar mostly by introducing

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,000
some underlines but we

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,440
ended up going forward with this one

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,559
right here because it was the most

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,840
simplistic

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,120
and i didn't introduce any extra design

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,279
elements

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
and finally i want to review design

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,600
documentation

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,320
so with design documentation um

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,240
our main goal is to eliminate any

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,840
discrepancies that designers and

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,679
developers may come across

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,840
in the design and the reason

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
this happens is because designers

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,440
sometimes work quickly

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
i am one of them um and so you're

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,840
copying and pasting creating artboards

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
changing out styles either to hit

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,720
deadlines or

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,159
you know just quickly experiment with

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,320
something um

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,159
and so what ends up happening is when

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,279
other designers or other developers

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,159
go in um to the art boards

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,960
or to figure out what the uh what the

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,320
style is

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,240
uh sometimes they'll find those

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
discrepancies and they have questions

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,559
about them

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,559
like is typography supposed to be like

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,600
this or is typography supposed to be

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,840
like that

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,080
um and so what we want to do is we want

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,240
to create the single source of truth

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,200
that designers and developers can go to

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,000
to help answer

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
those questions

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,919
so usually with design documentation we

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,200
focus on typography

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,760
documenting the grid system styles

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,080
scale and spacing components and other

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,799
different variations

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,320
our team creates design documentation in

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,799
two different spots

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,600
so we'll create design documentation in

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,120
figma

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:30,640
and this is usually uh in the form

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,159
of styles and a component library

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
and then we'll create more detailed

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,799
documentation in a google doc

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,600
and this will usually create this uh

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,840
google doc

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,600
is usually our style guide which has

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
details around things like our grid

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,039
system

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:51,120
scales and spacing and typography

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,039
so i just wanted to show some of the

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,640
styles that we have put together in

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,679
sigma um

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,760
so this is our typography uh system and

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,919
we had actually created styles and figma

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,840
for this so it's super easy to go in and

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,679
update if needed

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,840
but what we usually document is we

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,079
document our font size

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,119
line height letter spacing and text

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,720
transform

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,399
and we do that for all the different

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,119
types of typography that

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,359
appear in the design system

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,159
we also document our colors so these

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,040
also appear

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,119
as styles and sigma um and so we have

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,560
our main colors that we use within the

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,560
design system but also

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,119
some tints of those colors that are

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,520
associated with that main color

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,520
and then we also create components and

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,800
we add them to the component library and

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,960
figma

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,639
so we create a component and then all

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
the different states that that component

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,159
can appear in

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,079
uh for example here we have our header

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,079
and this is how it appears by default

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,159
but we also have a sticky header which

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,399
is a little bit more narrow

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,320
we have our drop down and then the

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,480
navigation and all the different states

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,119
that navigation can appear in

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,960
and then what our header looks like when

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,040
the navigation collapses

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,839
into that um into that hamburger nav

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,320
we also create styles for both desktop

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,960
and

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,359
mobile because of our timeline we did

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,079
not

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,680
have the bandwidth to create those

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,000
styles for tablet

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,160
um but we worked closely with developers

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,400
to to kind of work out the tablet style

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,839
as they were developing uh to kind of

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
figure out if things were kind of

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,880
looking off

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,960
um they'd ping jared and i and we you

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,560
know hop in a screen share

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,560
and then we'd make recommendations

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,280
we also document our form fields um so

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,200
these are also components within the

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,359
figma library

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,960
and um we have all the different states

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,560
for those form fields

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,800
um so we have the focus state what it

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,359
looks like with an air state

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,119
and then the various other types of form

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
fields like check boxes and radio

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,359
buttons

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,720
and submit buttons and all the different

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,720
states that those can appear in

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,760
so i am going to uh switch back

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,640
to my keynote here um because i want to

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,480
talk about

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,960
um what's next when it comes to oliveiro

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,440
because we are in a really exciting time

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,240
right now

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
we're actually in the process of going

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,200
through some usability and accessibility

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,800
testing

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,800
this was something that we had wanted to

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,480
do earlier in the design phase but

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
unfortunately do the timeline

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,800
um it wasn't we couldn't fit it in um so

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,480
we're kind of doing it near the end of

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,920
the design phase

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,920
and we're actually in partnership right

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,079
now with the national federation of the

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,240
of the blind to conduct that usability

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,480
and accessibility testing

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,480
and kat shaw who is one of our teammates

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,560
is actually heading up that endeavor

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,400
the results have been super positive so

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,160
far which make us all really happy

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,520
from a development standpoint we're

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,760
aiming for a

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,920
beta level stability so we can include

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,359
it in the default theme

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,720
in the 9.2 release which should be

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,119
june 2021 so right now um

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,359
it is uh included in drupal when you

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,720
download drupal but you actually have to

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,800
activate it

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,240
um so right now it isn't the default

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,520
theme hoping june

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,560
2021 um that it will be the default

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,880
theme

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,640
we've been also talking about dark mode

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
um so this was based on requests and

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,119
feedback and ideas that we had earlier

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,920
on

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,440
um when first started uh designing for

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,240
the aloe vera theme

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,359
um and so jared and i will probably be

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,400
jumping into that

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,680
uh uh into that initiative

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,880
um as soon as uh we can uh get that

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
started

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,079
and then finally a color switcher for

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
the theme

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,359
uh so right now editors uh don't have a

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,200
choice

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,680
on what colors the theme will appear in

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,440
uh it's in that default drupal blue

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,960
um but we'd like to give them more of a

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
choice so it fits more with their

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
branding so the idea is that they would

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,599
have

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,520
five different color themes that they

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,440
could choose from

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,359
some in a more neutral palette so that

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,920
way it works with a wide variety of

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,920
branding

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,960
so um

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,640
i guess we have time for questions which

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
is amazing because sometimes this runs a

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,400
little bit long

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,440
um but uh before we get into questions i

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,079
did want to

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,440
point you to two resources um if you

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,599
want to learn a little bit more about

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,280
aloe vera or you want to get involved in

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,280
the initiative

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,000
first we have the project page which you

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,720
can find on drupal.org

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
and there you can find the the history

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,520
behind

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,599
aloe vera how it got started you can

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
access the figma files that i showed

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,280
today and learn a little bit more about

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,720
how to get involved if you're interested

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,000
in getting involved

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
um we also have a slack channel um that

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,240
it

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,599
is a good place to go um if you are uh

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,760
if you do want to get involved in the

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,119
initiative we do have a stand-up that i

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,160
think happens on

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,079
uh mondays um where uh

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
you know developers and designers kind

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,480
of uh

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,000
go in slack and we have up where people

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,200
can talk about you know what's happening

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,359
in olivero right now

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,359
so

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,160
so i think i think that's it uh so we

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,680
have time for questions

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,520
um so i am going to

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,320
go and see if anybody has any questions

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,839
or jared

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,720
you can submit them using the q a tab at

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,839
the bottom

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,839
of your zoom interface if anyone has

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
okay

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,760
and i'm assuming that everyone's

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,240
actually off looking at the figma files

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
right now and not

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,440

um yeah

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,520
yeah and like design systems are i mean

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,560
this

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,520
this presentation it's about a specific

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
design system

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,359
but um i think jared was digging more

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,240
into design systems

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,280
um a little while ago because i feel

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,880
like that's something

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,960
that's something that we try and focus

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,839
in as designers at lullabot

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,839
