Description: 
	Presented by: PJ Hagerty, DevRelate.io
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Design/UI/UX Track

Abstract: When we build applications for the modern world, we think of our users as much as possible. But what about those who are on the fringes, outside of the average.

This talk will take a look at accessibility, how to design applications with users with disabilities in mind.

as mark said our talk is called a

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,840
glimpse into accessibility my name is pj

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
hagerty

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,920
i'm the founder of devrelate.io which is

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,559
a developer relations as a service

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
company

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
i also work at a company called matter

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
most recently and we're going to talk a

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
little bit about accessibility today so

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:31,840
bear with me the beginning part is going

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:31,840
to go pretty fast

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:13,840
you're born

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
no so i'm not going to sign the whole

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
talk um

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,920
if some of you know what asl is that's

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
what i started this talk off with and

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,720
the point of starting the talk off with

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
in asl

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,159
is to give you a feeling what it's like

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,079
to not have access to the information

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
that you want or need

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
signing in this case instead of speaking

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
was a barrier that prevented a lot of

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
people in the audience from

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
understanding

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
the story that i was trying to tell so

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
let me start again from the top and

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
first i'll introduce myself

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
my name is pj hagerty i'm a senior

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
developer advocate at mattermost i'm

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,840
also the founder of devrelate.io

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
and i'm on the board at um osmihelp.org

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,239
most the people who pay me the most

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,000
money um is an on-prem secure chat ops

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
uh platform it's all open source you can

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
build it the way you want it

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,720
it is free there is an enterprise

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
edition if you need more help

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,640
um community and team communication with

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,959
safety and security in mind

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
to learn more check out

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,879
mattermorespot.com but let's go back to

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,519
the beginning of the actual talk

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,120
why this talk so part of this talk was

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,840
inspired by these two people

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
this is bill and lena my mother and

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,640
father-in-law they met at the deaf

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
olympics in the 1960s and it's a great

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
story and i'm sure you'd all love to

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
hear it

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,280
but this is neither the time nor the

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
place i'd be happy to answer those

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
questions

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
later um that said these are the two

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
people that i think of most often when

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,959
i'm designing software and you might say

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
why why would you worry about a couple

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
of deceptogenerians who barely know how

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
to hook up a camera

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
to a usb port believe me they're more

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,879
savvy than that but we have had many

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
conversations about cameras usb ports

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,400
usb usbc usb2 usba all of that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
and many family dinners and functions

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,440
but aren't we focused on the cutting

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
edge shouldn't we be focusing on our

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
groups of 16 35 year olds which are

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
are the largest consumer group when it

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
comes to making technology

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,599
and the answer quite simply is no

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,480
this was the true beginning of this talk

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
bill and leaner are my inspiration

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
but this was the beginning of this talk

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
and i want to make it clear before we go

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
too far

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
i'm not here to sound holier than now or

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,319
like i'm super woke

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
the idea here is unless something has

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,040
touched your life you probably don't

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
consider it

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,280
in your day-to-day coding um this

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,720
screenshot is from a tweet from someone

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,159
i really look up to someone who i

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
consider one of the best

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,120
coders in the world not only because of

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
the high quality of code they produced

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
and the success they've had over the

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
years but because of their consideration

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,080
and their empathy in the way that they

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,280
do things the way they write code and

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
the way they live their lives

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,200
the way they're dedicated to diversity

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
and inclusion even if that's something

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
they don't have to do because they are

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,799
so successful

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,000
but they do it because they love what

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,280
they do it's from november

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
of last year neither video chat nor deaf

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
people using it for this purpose

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,479
was new when this tweet came out and yet

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
this person who again

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,880
very considerate person an amazing

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
person i consider a mentor

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,639
had never thought about it before

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
because it wasn't a part of their life

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
um we like to think that we're like

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
really used to understanding

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
accessibility because the everyday

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
things we experience

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
but the same time like we can't even get

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
the names right

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
here's a discussion between two people

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
two developers talking about

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
captions note in these tweets the

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
complete lack of the word

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,360
captions subtitles are for people who

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
speak a language other than the

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
language in the video presented for

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
example i know a lot of developers like

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,080
anime and a lot of animes in japanese

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,240
and it will have english subtitles those

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
are subtitles not captions

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
captions present a person with the words

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,240
or a paraphrase of the words especially

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,240
when it comes to live captions

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
being spoken in the moment they are not

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
the same thing

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
if you really want to get an

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,600
understanding of how that works watch a

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,759
subtitled movie a

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
foreign film film foreign to you i

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
should say

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
and watch it with subtitles on then

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
watch a live sporting event with

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
captions and see the difference

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
you'll see that the captions aren't

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,880
catching exactly what's being said

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
but they try to convey the general idea

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
unless it's like a really fast sporting

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
event it's like hockey

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,160
or basketball in which case sometimes

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
they don't even get to the idea they

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,000
just go as fast as they possibly can

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,759
um names might not seem important but

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
vocabulary and communities where

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
accessibility is an issue

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
issue is crucial here we have another

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,720
example

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
can anyone tell me feel free to drop

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
into the chat can anyone tell me the

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,759
difference between these two people in

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
the job they are performing

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
and it might be tough because this is

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,240
still still image but the woman on the

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
left

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
wearing the the black outfit there next

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,680
to the nurse in the flower

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,560
she's an interpreter an interpreter

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
yeah you got it maurizio an interpreter

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
voices for a deaf person in a situation

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
when they sign and signs the information

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
the doctor or nurse is giving to the

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,360
patient

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,360
often they will not sign the exact words

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,840
the hearing person in the situation

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
is using their voice to say the exact

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
words but the deaf person doesn't need

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
they need to get the idea

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,319
this is because asl is not a direct

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
correlation to spoken english

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
uh the order of words in asl is very

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
different

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
um for example you know we'll say i'm

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
going to the store in asl it's you know

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
store go me

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
that's the importance of the words in

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,680
this situation on the right we have a

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,440
translator

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
a translator takes the exact words and

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,160
phrasing of a person using one language

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
and uses it to discuss some use it to

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
construct and relay the information to

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
another person

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
in a second language this task

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
translates word for word whenever

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
possible

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,880
there's a fine line between these two

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,319
jobs but calling them by the right name

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
helps it's super important

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
if you like to know more about deaf

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
culture this whole talk isn't about deaf

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,880
culture

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
but if you'd like to learn more about

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
deaf culture in general i recommend

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
filing

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,240
following a guy named niall demarco on

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
twitter niall's deaf he grew up in a

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
deaf family and he advocates for the

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
needs of deaf people worldwide

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,479
um you might already know who he is

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,759
because he rose to fame as a model and

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
then he had a run

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
where i believe he won the american

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
television program dancing with the

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
stars

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
um he has a super positive outlook on

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
everything he does

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
and a ridiculous sense of humor he's a

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
really funny dude

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,639
i highly recommend following him on

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
twitter watch his videos

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,440
you'll learn a lot about deaf culture

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
that you probably didn't know and

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
there's going to be some moments where

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,360
you say oops i i've done that

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
and sometimes your discomfort is is all

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
part of the learning process so if i

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
follow niall see what you can learn um

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,319
but on to accessibility

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
we're here to talk about technology this

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
is a technology conference all things

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
open we love technology

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
and there are some examples we use

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
earlier like facetime video

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,720
chat caption those are excellent

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,400
examples of assistive technology

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
all of them are more or less hardware

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
based or in the case of

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
interpreters they're physically based in

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
the real world

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
the same is true of larger solutions

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,879
like video relay services

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
back in the day deaf folks if they

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,560
needed to call someone they needed to

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
use a tty

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
how many folks have used a tty just feel

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,879
feel free to raise your hands and make

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
me feel like we're all in the same room

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,280
it was horribly slow it relied on one at

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
a time communication

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
taking turns and if you needed to call a

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
hearing person like the gas company

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
or you wanted a pizza delivered there

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,039
was no guarantee of success

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
no guarantee whatsoever now it works a

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,599
lot more smoothly

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
and the fact that direct communication

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
can be had

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,880
but what's missing like what when we

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,159
build web and mobile applications what

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,600
are we forgetting about when we build

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
things like video relay service

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,760
when we first started considering issues

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,440
of accessibility we were first concerned

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,279
with blind or site impaired users oddly

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
one of the easiest things in the world

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,800
was alt text it was a solution that

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
wasn't built for screen

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,279
readers but when accessibility tools

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,600
like jaws came around alt text was made

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
so that like our image here if an image

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
doesn't show a description would

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
so that was the original purpose of alt

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,480
text

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
luckily screen readers picked up on this

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,200
and it became slightly more common to

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,040
see in use

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
unfortunately many modern languages

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,680
especially those that generate html

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,720
dynamically do not include alt text

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,480
generators

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
these levels of abstraction have made it

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
more difficult to have an accessible

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,399
site or application

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
if you're wondering what languages i'm

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,040
talking about i'm talking about some of

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,160
the modern php frameworks like cake

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,160
uh ruby on rails does it will

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
generate an empty alt tag which isn't

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
great

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
a lot of the javascript languages won't

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
bother to do anything at all

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
um you're so you're what you're giving

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,720
up in ease of use and

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,200
faster minimal viable product time

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,760
you're losing in the accessibility war

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
so that's not such a great thing

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
so there's some trips tips to adding alt

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
tags the first being

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
make it meaningful so everybody close

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
your eyes for a second and i believe

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
that you're doing this i totally 100

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
trust in you even though this is a

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
virtual conference

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
and i have no way of proving it's true

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
close your eyes for a second

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,120
i'm going to describe to you something

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
two times so keep your eyes closed the

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,480
first description here we go

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,160
a picture of the ocean

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,000
okay the second description the ocean

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,480
with rolling waves crashing over one

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,160
another the sun high overhead

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
a seagull in the distance hovering over

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,519
the waves

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,440
one of those descriptions had value the

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
other did not

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
adding a longer alt text that fully

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,800
describes the picture adds value to the

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,399
citer application

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,839
if you can't come up with descriptive

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,880
text ask yourself if that image is truly

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,440
necessary

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
also try to add value by not by avoiding

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,600
words like

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,320
graphic of image of diagram of in your

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
alt text

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
that's not helpful to a screen reader if

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
you're dealing with someone who has

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,880
never had sight

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
telling them that it's a picture of

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
something they've never seen doesn't

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,959
really help them at all

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
this one seems like an easy one because

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,399
it does make it easier

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
for folks with no sight and parent and

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,760
no sighting parent but label your form

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
fields

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,000
beyond the design aspect of it looking

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
nice labeling form fields

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
is similar to adding all text to images

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
it allows the screen reader to

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
understand the information that needs to

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
be entered

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,320
and where in this case many modern

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
languages allow this by default and the

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
abstraction layers can be helpful

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,399
why is that true for form fields not

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
images we may never know

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
i think part of it is a design decision

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,360
uh they want the design to look good but

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,240
they're not considering the actual

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
screen reader

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
it's just coincidental that this works

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,839
out for them

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,519
additionally allowing any credit card

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,519
fields to automatically default to the

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,360
card being used instead of picking it

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,680
or using a dropbox to select the credit

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
card type is extremely helpful and it's

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
just

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,279
good design in this day and age there's

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
no reason why you can't do it

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,600
paypal has a whole set of tools for

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,040
accepting transactions through a website

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
if you need to go and get their design

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
help go get their designs their design

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,839
help

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
beyond the design aspect screen reader

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
software can get hung up on things like

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,720
drop boxes and pick lists

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,720
try to avoid them if you can

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
here's another one that kind of goes

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,440
along the same lines give button

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,760
elements inner text

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
or if it absolutely must under any all

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
circumstances be a graphic

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
label it properly with alt text that

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
corresponds to what a textual button

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,639
label would be

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
this is similar to the alt text issue

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,079
and the form issue

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,240
being descriptive makes it easier for

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,760
the sight and pair to grasp what it is

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
they're they're clicking on or what you

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
want them to click on what it is you

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
want your user to do

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,200
also similar to the form elements this

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
benefits non-site impaired people as

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
well

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,480
some of the basic needs of accessibility

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,160
fall over into just good design good ux

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
and ui strategies

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
and that's really what we want right

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,160
we're trying to build a better

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
application build a better

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
site for our users if we're true to that

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
then these these things should be

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,680
falling in line

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,839
radio buttons need labeling too it's

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
impossible to use the field set element

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,639
in html

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
to label a group of choices i'm sorry

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
it's possible to use that

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
the field set element of html to label a

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
group of choices

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
this can make it way easier to read

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,480
radio buttons and make it way easier to

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,160
to label them same logic here make it

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,839
easy for people to understand

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
what they're interacting with understand

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
what choice they are making and help

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
them to understand this is a radio

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
button this is a single choice

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
which is an interesting thing because i

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
know how radio buttons were described to

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,800
me when i first started programming and

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
i don't know if they're still described

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
that way

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,480
especially because i don't know how many

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
people actually remember push button

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
radios

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
that were in cars back in the 70s 80s

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
that's where they got their name

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,560
that's another fun conversation we can

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,839
have after the after the talk

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,199
um fonts seem like an important thing

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,399
because they are

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,920
these are super really important um

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
and i don't mean let's make everything

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
comic sans we should not make everything

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
comic sans

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,760
it's the world we don't want to we none

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,279
of us want to live in

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,000
fonts can affect though the way that

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,000
people look at your site and application

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,160
generally most sites work with helvetica

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,160
or ariel or some variation thereof

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
i know we all have our specialized font

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
sets and and custom made fonts

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
specifically for our companies that's

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
great

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,440
make sure that they're easy to read um

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,160
the ariel and helvetica make content

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,120
easier to

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
get easier to digest hence it become the

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,639
default for so many

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
frameworks fortunately these are also

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
fonts that are easier to reach

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,519
than interact with making it better for

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
both the sight impaired

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
hard of hearing people who need to read

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
content and others

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
when i say others consider this

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
oftentimes

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
when you're using serif fonts even

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
though it looks fancy and it's very

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,519
pretty

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,279
people with dyslexia have a very

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,199
difficult time understanding what those

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,959
letters are trying to do

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,639
dyslexia is the main reason to avoid

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,760
serif fonts

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,040
not just because it looks cool

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
captioning we mentioned this a little

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,720
bit earlier but it isn't always a simple

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
simple process there are so many

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
services out there

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
um live captioning at tech events like

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,399
like ato is becoming more and more

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,320
popular

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,560
but also with the abstraction layers

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
that we have on actual uh

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
presentations and things like that make

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
it kind of difficult

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,240
uh you know i know that at events i've

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
done we've done um

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,360
yep maurizio i saw your question i will

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,720
totally get to that

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,759
um but i know that devops says buffalo

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
we used a thing called white coat

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
caption it did live captioning

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,320
it's a lot harder now that we're in the

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
virtual world believe it or not

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
it's actually more difficult things like

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
zoom and

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,519
and uh and other platforms don't have

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
automatic captioning

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,480
and it causes severe delays and problems

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
and a lot of times doesn't come out very

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,519
well

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,800
but it is becoming more common to live

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
caption things

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,079
um there's a lot of video out there for

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
tutorials and how you do that on pages

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,959
making caption doesn't only aid the hard

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
of hearing but it's also great for folks

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,839
with dyslexia

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
because a lot of times they follow

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
written words better

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,959
and it helps them with their dyslexia um

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,399
and it's not just you know think of it

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
you know is reading instead of hearing

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
the content some people just learn

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,440
better that way

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,959
let's see now i clicked on that chat

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
when i first started looking at

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
accessibility one of the biggest

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,839
blockers was javascript

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
10 years ago if you wanted an accessible

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,480
ada that's the american with

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
disabilities act

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,639
compliance site it meant cutting

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
javascript down to as near to zero as

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
you could get

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,920
these days modern javascript can be made

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,519
accessible

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
every flavor of javascript has different

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
protocols and some are more accessible

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,560
than others

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
node is getting better vue.js is really

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
good with accessibility

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
um be aware of the pros and cons when

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,399
you're adding javascript to a website

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
and listen i get it this is an open

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,360
source conference and everybody loves

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
javascript and

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,399
let's be honest if you're working on the

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,800
internet at all you're working with

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,240
javascript we all have to do it

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,320
you know but maybe we don't have to do

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
it in the vanilla sense or in the horrid

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
jquery sense but

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
there's javascript somewhere in your

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,759
application try to make sure that

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
wherever that javascript is

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,439
is working wherever it's doing something

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,439
it's doing it in an accessible way

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
so the focus for many of the basics that

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,120
we've seen so far has been on the site

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
impaired

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,160
since our media is the internet it's

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,439
essentially visual media so this has

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,600
always been the case

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,839
that said the visually and impaired

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,959
aren't always blind people

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,520
the same way that hard of hearing

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,919
doesn't mean 100 unable to hear

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,679
there are gradients to this thing we

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,960
need to be aware of all the things we

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,080
need to code for

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,919
we need to be aware of our audience i

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,400
use this picture as a great example

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,799
i am not this hard sucks as a virtual i

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,720
am not a tall person

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,320
when i go to concerts a lot of times

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
this is what i see

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,200
i see some people they're definitely on

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,120
stage they're definitely playing music

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
i just wish i could see their faces but

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,080
chances are as soon as the arms go up

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,039
i'm not going to

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,840
that's life i don't have access full

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,840
access to this stage

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
youtube is an excellent example of a

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
visual medium

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,720
most visually impaired folks will not

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,520
head to youtube for content

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
the site's too busy it's ridiculously

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,559
hard to navigate with something like

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
jaws or a screen reader

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,200
um youtube is not in any way accessible

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,559
that's changed in recent months and

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,320
they've added some features to make it

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840
easier to move around

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,840
but some of them like you literally have

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,080
to pay for youtube whatever it was at

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,559
youtube right now or youtube tv

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
whatever they're calling it this week um

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,760
whatever i'm getting messages that i'm

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
never going to sign up for

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,760
but these things are hidden behind a pay

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,039
wall and that's not really fair

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
on the other side though on the

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,520
non-slated pair the captions

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,039
are pretty good they're not perfect or

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
universal

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
but deaf and hard of hearing people love

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
youtube like in the past two or three

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
years

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
it was like they've rediscovered it

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
caption videos opened up a world for

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,840
deaf and hard of hearing

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
people that they've been blocked out of

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
for a long time think of how long you've

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,360
been using youtube think of the first

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,799
time you watched a youtube video

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
and think about only having that

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,880
experience for the last two or three

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,039
years

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
because captions were only really really

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,720
available for the past two or three

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
years

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
they've been available longer but they

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
don't they didn't work properly into the

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
last two or three years

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,600
other video services like netflix and

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,200
hulu they're seeing value in it well

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,960
uh believe it or not when netflix first

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
came out you couldn't use captions at

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
all

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
it wasn't worth it now that's all you

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,480
know that's all my in-laws watches

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
netflix they love there's so many shows

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
they're rediscovering

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,120
because they finally have captions to

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,520
put to them that's about knowing your

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,520
audience

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,240
um site is kind of important it's

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
basically how we use the internet it's

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
like i said

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
there's another category of blindness we

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
need to be aware of

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
how many people can see the the number

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,200
in this image i'm curious if you can't

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
see it say something in the comments

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,440
maurizio is on point this guy knows how

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,280
to use comments

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,159
um so the number is 74.

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
mike can't see it the number is 74. it's

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,960
in green and light green and yellowish

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
green

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,159
on a brown background um

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,520
color blindness also known as color

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,799
vision deficiency

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,159
affects approximately 1 in 12 men or 8

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,840
and 1 in 200 women in the world no one

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,799
knows why men are more effective than

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
women

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
there's no clear reason that it's just a

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
genetic thing

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,400
there are different causes for color

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,760
blindness there's different types

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
red green color blindness can make

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,760
images like this one difficult to see

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
if you thought you weren't colorblind

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,320
and you cannot see that number i highly

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,080
recommend you see an ophthalmologist you

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,280
might have a colorblindness issue and

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,360
it might be easily corrected with

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,720
glasses believe it or not

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,919
it makes it important to look at your

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
color scheme when you're considering

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
building an application though

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,320
if you're dealing with colorblind people

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
you need to know that right

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
less of an accessibility but more of a

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,360
need to remember kind of thing

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
is there's a whole world of mobile

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
applications out there in the world

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
allowing for pinch to zoom capabilities

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,799
let sight impaired folks pick out what

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,159
they want to read what they're able to

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
read and interact with

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
um i worked with a gentleman named

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,080
austin who

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,240
was 100 percent blind they considered

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,159
him 100 blind he had a guide but with

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,280
the accessibility features of the iphone

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,760
and the the mac os ecosystem he was 100

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
able to be

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
a top-notch programmer and he often

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,799
built applications that worked better

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
for blind people because that was his

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,320
audience that was

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
knowing who he dealt with um

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,200
additionally mobile fights

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,960
devices mean better access to the world

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
in general if we look at the example

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
used earlier

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
facetime this is essentially a way to

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,559
replace the tty for daily use

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,400
my wife and her mother they communicate

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
daily on facetime and i'm going to tell

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
a little story here my mother-in-law is

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
from sweden

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,080
before the advent of mobile applications

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
like facetime her choices for

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
communicating with her brother who's

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
continues to live in stockholm

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,080
from her home here in buffalo new york

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,679
were to write a letter

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
and wait a couple weeks for it to reach

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,520
him send an email

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,320
which was okay but not quite the same

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,760
thing send a fax come on really

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,679
can you imagine how much of facts from

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
buffalo to sweden cost

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
and then wait for them to be or wait for

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,559
them to be in the same place which was

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,159
rare now they chat daily she's been

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,080
living here since the 1960s she's been

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
living here for 50 years apart from her

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,880
brother

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,080
only in the last five to 10 years that

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,200
she's been able to communicate with him

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,320
on a daily basis

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,600
how crazy is that and it's face time and

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
imessage these aren't complicated

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,440
technologies but the technology allowed

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,159
them to communicate the same frequency

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,400
as hearing people it gave them access to

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
something we've all had for so long

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
a tremendous breakthrough that only

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
occurred in the last 10 years

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,080
so how do we check for these things how

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,559
can we ensure that

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
an application is compliant or at least

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,880
accessible

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,799
and should i have access to an audience

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,919
with accessibility needs fun fact you

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
probably should have someone in your

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,200
realm with accessibility needs

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,679
there should be someone on your staff

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
someone on the qa team someone somewhere

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,679
who has accessibility needs so that you

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,039
can check and before we

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,520
look at these tools let me say this is

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,799
not an exhaustive list

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,000
there are a lot of tools out there and

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
there's a lot of experts out there that

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
will tell you what they like

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
i always recommend the best fit for your

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
team organization i will say these are

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
tools that i have used in the past

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,159
and that's why you know these aren't

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,960
this isn't an endorsement from pj told

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,039
me to use this

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,400
it's just a suggestion just a place to

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,039
get you started you will find other

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,039
things i'm sure

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,280
that said let's take a look

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
um first thing is the accessibility

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,840
accessibility engine or

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,320
x this tests out an html document to

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,840
find potential issues with accessibility

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
this tool gives you a score so it lets

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,679
you know how well you are complying with

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,039
the ada guidelines for accessibility i

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,520
believe at level one

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,279
which is kind of your minimum like i

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
have an accessible website

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,720
um there's level two and three and

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,279
that's like can i apply

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,200
my application to a government you know

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
for a government contract or

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,480
for university contracts or for

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,840
education and they have different

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
different accessibility needs depending

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,279
on where what

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
what your end user goal is there's

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,120
browser extensions that integrate this

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,279
in both firefox and chrome and i believe

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,039
brave if you're into that scene

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,880
and that'll help you to see what can be

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,400
fixed and where it gives you a great

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
report gives you the score it lets you

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,840
know exactly where you need to make

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
fixes

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,360
pali pa11y pronounced pali

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
is another tool that can help bring

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,720
attention to any accessibility issues an

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,799
application might have

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
pali is a script you drop a url in and

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,760
it runs the check

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,279
if you you then get a report you can

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
sort from there like what action you'd

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,679
like to take

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
again this action is going to be on you

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
there's nothing that you're going to be

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
able to run that's going to fix

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,279
everything in your application for you

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840
you're going to have to kind of like

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,559
figure that out for yourself

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,080
jaws is of course the tool that gets

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,600
mentioned most often everybody's kind of

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,039
aware of this one

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,840
for those who don't know jaws is an

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,159
acronym job access with speech

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,760
it is the most commonly used screen

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,840
reader available

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,039
it is thorough and it covers every

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
accessibility

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,679
issue that blind people might have when

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,159
using the internet

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,440
jaws unlike the previous two tools is

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,679
not free however

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,799
that said there's a free version you can

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
see it there

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
at the download you know under the

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,000
download jaws you can get it and i think

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
it it does most of what jaws does it

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
will give you a good impression of how

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,760
it works

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,840
it'll help you to understand what you

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,000
need to do and what needs to happen

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
um it will it will give you the

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
experience of what jaws is like for an

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
end user

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
and that's really what you're looking

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,960
for if you plan on doing extensive

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,960
research i highly recommend paying for

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,440
jaws

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,880
for testing things like color blindness

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,279
toptol has an excellent

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
uh filter that allows you to enter a url

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,159
and then see what it looks like

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,760
for people who have color blindness i've

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,360
done this with my own websites

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,960
both and devrelate.io

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
uh with develop.io it led to us

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,159
completely revamping our site

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
because it was clear that through it

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,039
through a colorblind reader you couldn't

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,080
read half the content

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,200
uh which was crazy um this is key like

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,679
it really clarifies

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,320
how much the issue affects colorblind

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,240
users

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,159
it is super super awesome um

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
it also i mean in general beyond the

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,960
whole application development things it

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
helps you to understand a little bit of

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,600
what

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,279
your users might go through and

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
colorblindness like i mean eight percent

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
of men

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,120
that's not a super uncommon number like

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,039
if you start crunching numbers

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
out of seven seven billion people eight

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,080
eight percent

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,679
what's eight percent of seven billion

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,919
ready go okay who's

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
who's the first answer i will give you a

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,880
chris hi five when next we meet with

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
elbows or something i don't know what

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
we're doing after coving

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
but it's a significant number of people

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,120
that's what i'm trying to say

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
so i mean just take a look take a drop a

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,200
website in

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,679
it's toptall.com designers slash color

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,919
filter

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,840
color filters all one word take a look

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,200
and just see what your site looks like

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,600
it will be an intended pun and eye

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
opener

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,520
nothing beats testing with real people

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,440
that have access accessibility issues

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
having representation in this process

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,320
often makes the difference between

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
having a complete application that meets

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
the expectations of the users

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
and missing a few key things because we

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,720
don't think like people who need

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,840
accessibility applications

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,360
this is simpler than it seems uh we've

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
all heard the story i assume we've all

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,559
heard the story but i'll say it again of

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,440
the issue with facial recognition

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,640
software

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,200
i'm not talking about the political

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,480
issue or the whole big brother issue or

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,799
anything like that i'm specifically

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,240
talking about

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,480
the issue with the fact that it doesn't

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,159
read non-white faces

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,679
make sure your team is not exclusively

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,360
white people look at that you fixed an

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,480
accessibility issue

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,320
make sure the team that tests your

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,799
software is not exclusively white dudes

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
with beards look at that we've solved an

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,080
accessibility issue

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
and we've maybe made the world a better

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,080
place otherwise

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,279
you might have problems working on a new

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,960
video application

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,320
find some deaf students in your area

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,320
high school students colleagues

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,000
interns whatever and have them grade the

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,600
level of captioning accuracy after

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,240
they've read a transcript

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,799
a direct transcript is word for word

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,200
exactly what people need to hear

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,399
but maybe they can't or maybe reading is

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
easier for them

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,120
so the deaf person reads the transcript

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
then they watch the video and they see

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,240
how much it matches up

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,159
it's an interesting experience students

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,760
love doing this deaf people love to help

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
other people understand accessibility

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,840
issues for deaf people

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
you can easily do this diversity isn't

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
just about the teams we work with it's

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,840
also about the people using our

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
applications

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
this is key to what we do we i know we

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,480
hear a lot about diversity and inclusion

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
that has to include our end users it

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,360
needs to it's a must

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
there's no way we can get around it

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,919
remember as we start to wrap up

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,880
always use alt text on every image label

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,799
your form fields caption all your videos

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
default to the sound being off that's

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,000
just good practice if you have a video

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,640
that automatically plays when someone

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
goes on your website

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,840
very not well kept secret in the world

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
of web development

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,720
everyone hates your website um radio

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
choices need to need labels too mind

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
your fonts

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
know your audience use the tools you

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
know

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,080
and are used by end users remember

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,840
there are so many groups that want to

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,960
access the applications that we're

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,399
building

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,080
we need to break out of the idea that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,080
accessibility is for a limited group of

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
people it's for everyone

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,520
everyone needs to have access and we

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,640
need to think of everyone when we build

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,159
the future and that's what we're doing

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,440
right we're building our future

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
with web applications um if we give all

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,559
of our users a better experience why

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
wouldn't we do that

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
we've looked at ways to make things more

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
accessible many of which do not

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,520
add significantly to our application

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,039
development cycle

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,640
it will at first there'll be an initial

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
bump as you start to integrate tools and

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,200
things like that

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
but once you make it part of what you do

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,640
on a regular basis

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
it will make things better and these

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
things will make our applications

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,399
tremendously better for this minor minor

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,159
amount of effort

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,919
with a few easy steps we can make the

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
web and mobile worlds better places for

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,480
everybody

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,039
and isn't that really our goal isn't

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,480
that what we're trying to do

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,320
with that i'm happy to take any

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,600
questions you might have thank you so

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,159
much for having me

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,080
my information is on the screen i know

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,039
there's qa let me see what the questions

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,480
are

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,840
i recommend to plug in your website that

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
will grade your website accessibility

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,120
mercy i think i got that one

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,440
um when is alt text too long

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,640
so that that's an interesting question

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,840
actually

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,200
there's if you're getting into

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,640
paragraphs and things

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
if you're getting to anything beyond a

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,399
sentence of description

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,840
chances are you are going to

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,240
have problems it's going to be just way

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
too long

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,080
try to keep it to about a sentence two

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
sentences if you absolutely have to

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,279
if you're getting into something that's

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,559
more descriptive than a sentence or two

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,000
maybe look at what you're what you're

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,440
presenting and wondering why it's such a

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,120
complicated thing and why you need to

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,559
present that to people

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,240
um what are some federal local or

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
non-profit organizations that we should

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,880
network with

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,760
uh basically if you look up uh

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,480
a11y you will find lots of organizations

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,960
there's there's an international

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,559
international accessibility organization

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,919
i will tweet it out after this talk

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,640
because i can't remember the url for it

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
exactly

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
but there are great people to get in

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,799
touch with and they're happy to help you

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,840
with finding resources

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,279
um checking non-public sites eg internal

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,519
behind a firewall

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,799
um if you download the claire if you

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,919
download pally

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,720
the p a 11 y

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
um script you could do that directly on

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,519
your machine you can do that locally

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,799
so you should be able to do that behind

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,799
a firewall shouldn't be a problem

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,600
let's see answer that question

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,159
this is a pretty cool thing here you can

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,919
mark off what questions i asked

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,559
um we answered that i'm going to answer

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,559
that on twitter

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,080
cool ashley are sarah's fonts the only

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,440
ones to avoid are fancy fonts should be

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,519
avoided in general

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,960
i would i would avoid fancy fonts in

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,440
general um

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,200
i am not great at design you can't see

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,279
this but i'm wearing a t-shirt

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,559
and jeans because that's about as fancy

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,559
as i get

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,399
um really i i think that

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,080
the this the more simple you keep the

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,120
funds the reason why helvetica is such a

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,799
widely used font

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,000
is because it's sans serif and it's easy

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,080
to understand and that's why it's

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
everywhere it's like every street you

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,279
drive down

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,200
in all of the us is using a helvetica

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,240
font in some way shape or form

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,679
or helvetica base so fancy fonts should

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
be avoided if they can

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,480
if you can avoid them i know that

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,279
there's some design people disagree with

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,960
me on that

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
what is the significant significance of

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,559
the 11 in the name so 11

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,799
because between the a and the y in

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,799
accessibility there are 11 letters

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
that was an easy one nailed it good

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,640
question rebecca a lot of people don't

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,279
ever ask that question

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,799
what are accessibility's concerns to

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,960
consider for things like tables and

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,440
graphs on a web page or on mobile

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,519
uh tables and graphs should be graphs

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
you can treat pretty much like images

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,200
tables are really hard to navigate if

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,960
you can avoid table layout that would be

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,320
a wonderful thing

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,080
um but yeah i think that's

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,840
i think that's all i have time for

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,120
oh wait sometimes i feel like visual

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
design fails

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,880
falls to the wayside uh to be awake and

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
data compliant

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,080
do you have an example of super design

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,399
early websites uh that are

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,080
wake hacking ada compliant i don't off

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,960
the top of my head but i can find some

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,679
for you

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,880
anonymous attendee um if you send a just

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,279
dm me on twitter it's addisplenic

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,799
and i will find some examples for you my

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
good friend adrian roselli who is very

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,240
big in the

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,679
accessibility world has a whole list of

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,960
these resources that should be

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,039
should be easy for you to find and

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,279
follow

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,120
and i think that's all the questions i

00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:01,120
got all the questions done

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,120
yay um mark are you still around

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,279
oh there's one more question don't

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,200
forget the importance of links being

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,440
properly informative no click ears

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,240
yes exactly i mentioned that in the

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,359
beginning of the talk

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,240
no click here no submit make sure that

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,919
your buttons

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,280
and your links say exactly what they're

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,839
supposed to do

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,839
excellent point thank you anonymous

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
attendee

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,000
all right when you say tables are bad do

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,720
you mean specifically table or css piece

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
layouts

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,480
yeah a css based layout that looks like

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,720
a table claire is totally

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,480
fine as long as there's no think of it

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,879
this way if you turn grid lines on is it

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,560
going to prevent someone from seeing it

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,879
my suggestion if you're using a css

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
based layout that looks like tables

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,079
run it through jaws and see what jaws

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,839
says about it

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,200
if it's reading it like a table layout

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,200
then probably you need to find another

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,040
solution or maybe a different css

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,639
solution

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,000
but yeah if you're using a written an

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,760
actual table that's that's probably

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,160
horrible

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
but yes my suggestion is always run it

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,359
through jaws some css based layouts that

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,119
look like tables

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,280
will run through jaws exactly like you

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,520
were using the table tag

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,359
others will look at it like it's well

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,359
separated and very good looking content

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,040
all right i hope everybody enjoyed that

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,040
i hope not anybody left because i signed

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,560
the first five minutes of that

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,480
which can be off-putting i know it's a

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,920
little scary sometimes

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
but that was to give you a little

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,880
glimpse into what accessibility should

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,560
look like

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,440
so if that's all the questions

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,040
i'm going to stop sharing because i

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,640
think the next speaker is here

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:45,839
because it's a speaker and then speaker

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,839
and speaker

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,160
you still have about 10 minutes so if i

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
do oh you can

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,000
still go yeah so if anybody has any more

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
questions about accessibility feel free

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,720
to tweet at me

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,119
um this is a very complex issue it's you

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,200

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,119
this this talk is meant to give you an

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,000
idea or a starting point

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,960
um it's not meant to be the end-all

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960

i'm glad you enjoyed the asl my asl fun

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,160
fact

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,000
you can't tell because most of you don't

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,000
know is not great

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,119
i used to be fluent i am now slightly

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,200
less than fluent

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,800
if i brought my wife in to the office

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,240
here you would be blown away at how

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,680
different the two things that

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,400
that have occurred would be said um

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,920
but yeah it's uh i highly recommend

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,680
learning at least some asl

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,200
uh i've had lots of conferences where

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,680
i've been communicating

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
with the deaf attendees all to myself

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,480
like i can say whatever i want about the

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,920
whole community because

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,280
no one else can sign um we don't want

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,119
people to feel left out so learn a

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
little asl and it'll do it'll do some

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,839
good

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,000
and it's it's okay that the next

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,839
speakers are here extra early that makes

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,839
that that's awesome to me

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,520
no really feel free to turn your cameras

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,240
on we could have a we could have a full

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,240
transition here

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,680
um oh cool more questions

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
let's see claire any recommended places

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,520
to point developers to show what's in

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,079
their hands

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,960
i don't know what you mean by that

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,960
what's in their hands

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,079
like what capabilities they have or

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,160
claire if you could follow up and okay

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
not just picking colors for color

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,359
cardboard

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,440
yeah so um like there's lots of places

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,400
they can go to understand that

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,240
um this talk i think is being recorded

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,040
mark is that right

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,040
um but this is a you know this is a yes

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,200
that's correct it's being recorded

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
so yeah so feel free to share this talk

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,680
so they understand it's not just color

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,720
blindness

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,920
um generally take a look you know

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,720
anytime you see the

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,560
hashtag a11y stuff share it with other

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,000
developers so that they understand like

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
there's a huge responsibility that we

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,839
have it's really important

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,320
that we ensure that our websites are

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,560
accessible um

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,720
will the slides be available yes uh i

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,560
will put them up on slideo

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,400
or slide deck or somewhere i will tweet

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,680
it out so if you follow me on twitter

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,680
you'll definitely find out about that

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,040
after after the

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,000
after the conference um

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
do do do you know of any accessibility

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,040
regulations

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
that federal or state agencies must

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,880
follow

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,400
yes i know that um some of the simple

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,599
things that we talked about

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,400
maurizio like alt tags um

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,839
and having alternative sites i'll start

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
alternative navigation

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,119
on sites for for the site impaired and

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,440
for jaws readers

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,720
is a bare minimum ada level one i think

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,079
um requirement that if you are coding

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,680
first

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,320
at the federal level definitely state

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,200
agencies they change it kind of depends

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
on where you are

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,960
most of them expect you to be level one

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
compliant though but also if you if you

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,760
enter into a contract with them you have

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,720
a certain amount of time to get ada

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,079
compliant

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,560
even though that's been around for a

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,200
while um do i have any learning

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,119
resource for learning asl i do there's a

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,560
great thing called asl pro

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,480
and you can go and start learning words

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,480
there there are plenty of lessons online

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,160
uh on youtube actually to get you

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,400
started there's also a twitter thing

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,160
called asl sign of the day

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,280
that will teach you some things and

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
you're gonna start simple things like

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,599
thank you

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,040
um hello boy girl

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,640
things like that you know things that

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,280
are simple and straightforward

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,400
um and build up on that it's just like

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
any other language

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
practice practice practice practice

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,119
practice

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,560
try to find out what's required for each

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,960
business how do you know what level you

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,839
need to be for private web store owners

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,000
ashley that's a great question with

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,319
businesses it's kind of dependent upon

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,319
their

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
their desire businesses for the most

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
part

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
unless they are engaged in like selling

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,680
to to

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,280
government type actors um are not

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,920
required to be accessible

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,319
unfortunately um this is something that

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,079
that

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,079
i've run into several times with

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,760
websites that cannot be accessed in any

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,040
way shape or form

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
by sight readers and things like that

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,480
and it's it's sad and it's terrible

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,319
um but unfortunately there's not much we

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,160
can do about it

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,760
until there's some sort of regulation

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
put in place to say that all businesses

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,480
must

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,359
have accessible web stores or web fronts

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,800
or or whatever we want to call them

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,400
i will say this people who are using

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,760
shopify are getting a great deal because

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,680
shopify has a lot of focus on

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,200
accessibility

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,119
it's not required they do it because

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,240
they think it's good for good for the

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,880
community

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,920
and they're right quite frankly um but

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
yeah there's no

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,599
to my knowledge there's no specific

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
regulations around a business and what

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,640
level they need to be compliant

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,079
for a private web store no problem

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,319
i gotta tell you mark these people are

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,560
so polite they say thank you

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,240
uh for all the questions like that's so

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,680
great

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,839
oh yeah thank you so much i really

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,839
