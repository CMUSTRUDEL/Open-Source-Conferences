Abstract: How should we handle a "gender" field on forms? There has been a lot of conversation in recent years on how to make these fields more inclusive of people that identify as transgender, non-binary, or other marginalized gender identities. While this is a necessary effort, it is a small part of a much larger and more complicated picture. What does inclusivity of marginalized gender identities truly look like?

My challenge to user experience experts, content creators, and developers is to dig deeper and consider questions like:

- What assumptions do we make about users?
- Is asking for gender or other demographic information necessary?
- How do we handle a user changing their name or email?

Taking the time to reflect on some of these ideas can help create a better experience for users and contributors alike.

yeah definitely really excited to be

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,440
here today

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,120
and talk about a topic

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,160
that is definitely personally important

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,119
to me but i'll go ahead and get rolling

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
um so first just a little bit about me

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,960
i'm alex

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
i started working in web development uh

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
two or three years ago

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,160
after transitioning from a career in a

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,480
video production i identify as as

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,960
non-binary and queer

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,719
and uh i like to not get frustrated

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
filling out forms on the internet which

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680
i think

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
most people could uh get on board with

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
and you know

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,840
that is a lot of the reason why that

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
this is um

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
something of personal important

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,280
importance to me

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,840
i work at salvas labs we're located in

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
downtown durham well we're located

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
remotely

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
but for the most part based out of

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
downtown durham

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,720
and we focus a lot on

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,760
user experience when we're building uh

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,920
sites and

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,280
and apps and whatever the case may be

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
user experience is

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
one of the the biggest focuses in in

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,240
what we do

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
and along with that we've had a lot of

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
conversations

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,320
internally about um you know what

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,520
user experience looks like beyond

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,400
the traditional tenants and just um

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,040
based accessibility and and you know

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
other ways we can think about that

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,399
so as far as what we'll cover um let's

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,520
give a quick introduction on the talk

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,560
go over um some terms and related

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,000
terminology just to make sure everyone's

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,799
on a level playing field in terms of

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,799
that uh talk about why does this matter

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
why should you be worried about it

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
uh dig a little bit into assumptions

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,719
we're making about users and

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,080
unconscious bias uh and then finally

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,239
um learn to ask why before how

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
going beyond the form field and and

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,480
thinking about it

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
beyond a user interface perspective and

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,959
feel free to

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,959
drop questions in the q a chat as we go

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
um i'll try and answer things as we go

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
and if i

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
don't see them then we'll definitely

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
make discussion time

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
at the end so

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
i want you to think about how many

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,040
online forms you fill out

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
in a year which is a lot

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
you know i think even in a month we're

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,519
all filming out a lot of online forms

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
whether it's you know facebook or

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
twitter profile

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
you know filling out medical history at

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,599
the doctor's office surveys

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
all sorts of things that you're online

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,760
and

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
providing information about yourself and

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,200
some of the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
standard questions so to speak that come

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,080
on those

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
are things like your name uh your

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
birthday to get your age

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,800
your email getting a password and

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,760
extremely frequently is gender

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,959
um and these are just two example forms

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,080
i pulled online

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,400
but gender frequently is one of those

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
standard questions and i think it's one

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
that most of us

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,400
don't think about and i myself had not

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,519
really thought about

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,680
at all until a couple of years ago and

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
so

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
thinking of all those online forms you

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,319
filled out

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,360
have you ever had to select other

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
or prefer not to say as an option in a

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
field

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,439
or just not had anything to choose

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,439
um or have you ever had to submit a

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,400
required field that was information that

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
you just

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
didn't want to share with whatever it is

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
you were signing up for

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
um i know it's an experience i've had i

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
know

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,159
it's an experience a lot of under

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
underrepresented minority groups have

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,840
had and

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
you know transgender people specifically

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,359
specific to this talk

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,040
but it's definitely something that's

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
common and informs throughout

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
and just as a quick disclaimer i'm not

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
here to

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
talk about politics or social justice or

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
push

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,479
any kind of agenda it's something like i

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
said that's that's passionate to me

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
i'm passionate about just because of my

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,120
identity but

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,520
i i don't want to

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
have a little conversation and rather

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
i'm here

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,000
to advocate for your users um

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,639
and users are going

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,479
trans non-binary users are people that

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,520
are going to exist within your user

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,199
base whether you agree with their

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,080
identity or not

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
and in the same way we all build

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
accessible sites for

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,759
a small percentage of users that are

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
visually or mobility impaired because we

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
know

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
it's important to create an equal and

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
accessible

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,520
user experience for them my challenge is

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,400
to be building positive and good user

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
experiences

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,479
for users across an array of

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
demographics and

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,919
everything i'm talking about here is

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,800
pretty specific to gender

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
but i think can be applied across a lot

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,039
of

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
different demographic groups

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
overall i just want to advocate for

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
users and

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,080
do the best i can there and you know

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:53,759
leave all the nasty politics out of it

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:55,759
uh so quick primer on words um

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
definitely around uh gender and gender

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
identity there can be a few terms thrown

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
around that people aren't always

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
familiar with

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
and one of the big things there is is

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,199
differentiating between gender

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479
and sex and a lot of times to explain

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
this i use

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,120
the gender-bred person which is a really

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
great tool and resource

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
if you're ever trying to learn more

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
about some of this terminol

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,520
terminology and vocabulary they're

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,560
available at genderbread.org

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,680
but the purpose basically is to

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,880
differentiate and make the point that

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,960
gender identity uh your biological sex

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
your gender expression and your

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,759
sexuality

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,280
are all different things and none of

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
them are the same none of them can be

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
lumped in together

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,199
and while they certainly combine to

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,199
create the person you are

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,960
they should all be thought about kind of

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,880
independently and that's

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,479
more or less what um

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
the group that makes the gender red

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
person are trying to

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
express uh and so like i said one of the

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
primary things that tends to come up

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,000
here is the difference between

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,840
um sex and gender um and sex

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
you know can be thought about basically

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,440
as you know physiological

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,039
attributes uh genitalia chromosomes

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,759
hormones

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,560
things like that whereas gender identity

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
is more

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
in here it's a psychological sense of

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,720
self

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
and you know who you know yourself to be

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,000
um

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,720
and then gender expression uh

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
being that outward expression and kind

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
of the way you

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,520
present yourself to the world uh and the

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,160
other way

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
the gender red person is interesting is

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
it

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,440
encourages people to think about these

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,199
things on a continuum

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,840
so it's not necessarily an identity of

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,240
i feel like a man or i feel like a woman

00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,080
but the idea that

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,919
we can feel both um and on different

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,680
levels so you know we

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,280
someone who identifies solely as a woman

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,080
would probably be pretty along that

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
continuum

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,240
of womanness and either not on that

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
continuum or pretty low of madness

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
but i like this example because it

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,440
leaves room for

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
there to be a lot of flexibility in how

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,160
people

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
identify and to give kind of

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
an example of how someone would actually

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,440
look

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,880
on this i tried to like put my identity

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,320
in into this scale which you know

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
is not an easy thing to try to try and

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,959
do

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,240
and quantify into three uh small little

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,080
sliders

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
um but you know the idea being that

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
you know as a non-binary person i pretty

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
much fall in the middle there and

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,120
you know while i present more

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
masculinely

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
biologically

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,080
i'm more female so that's

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,600
you know uh and i present that mostly

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,279
just as a case of like i want you to

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,399
think about

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,680
who users like this might be

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,279
what they look like case in point um

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
and what's nice you know everyone's

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
gonna be a little bit different on that

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,120
and and have different preferences as

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,240
far as names and pronouns and

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
and things like that uh as far as some

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
other quick definitions

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,399
uh you might hear the the term cisgender

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,440
a lot uh which simply means

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,360
that uh your gender lines up with the

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
sex you were assigned at birth oh when i

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
say assigned at birth

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,080
it's you know the doctor is there and

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,839
says aha it's a boy

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
and puts mail on the birth certificate

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,279
that would be your birth assigned

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,920
sex so if you were born male

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
and identify as a man you would be

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,720
cisgender

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,320
generally speaking um and transgender is

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,120
just exactly the opposite of that

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
it's someone who's gender identified

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,399
identity

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
is different than the sex that they were

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,920
assigned at birth

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,880
and then non-binary

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,040
is basically an umbrella term for folks

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
who don't identify

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
exclusively as male or exclusively as

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
female

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,200
and falls somewhere in the middle there

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,600
and sometimes that might look like

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
someone choosing to be androgynous

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
sometimes

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
that might look like someone skewing

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
slightly masculine

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
center or feminine center or switching

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
back and forth

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,640
and there are a lot of identities that

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,480
fall under there

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,920
i listed a few there at the bottom

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,680
as much as i would like to be able to ex

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
explain all the nuance there there

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,600
certainly isn't time for that

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,600
in this presentation um

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,839
but the the point being that

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
non-binary is is this in between kind of

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,399
gray area

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,279
uh to think of and and folks who aren't

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
identifying

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,519
one way or the other on that gender

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
binary so to speak

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,240
so why does this matter um

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,720
and to talk about why this matters

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,200
it for me it's pretty simple but i like

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,320
to go back and think about

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
what user experience and ux design is

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
all about

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,519
um and i kind of pulled some

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
quotes from my co-workers as well as uh

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
cruising through the internet

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
and some thoughts of you know what is ux

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
design all about and obviously this is

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
something that

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,120
everyone will define a little

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
differently and see a little bit

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
differently but you know

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
some of the things i pulled out are

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
creating things

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,440
for the people uh solving problems with

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
empathy

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
and re removing obstacles and friction

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,160
from your user's path

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,880
um creating positive emotions

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,320
establishing

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,680
trust making accessible interfaces

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
all of this is something that can go

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
into

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,360
to ux design and and

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,360
some of the goals in that and

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,639
pay attention to the bolded words

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
because those will

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,680
carry us a little bit into the next

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
slide um

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
and i have a couple quotes on the next

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,880
slide that are from

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,880
a company called league

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
has a really great post on medium

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,079
about creating inclusive gender inputs

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
and as part of that

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,160
they did some user testing and surveys

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
and so

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,079
a couple of these quotes are what they

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,920
included within that blog

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,000
so one of them is i feel like i'm a

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,440
person that doesn't get reflected

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,200
in forms it's invalidating

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
it's possible folks will identify with

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
one of the options on a form

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
when they don't it can be a hurtful

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,160
reminder that their journey is not

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,880
reflected and for me the

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
entire answer of why does this matter

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,160
lies

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
here and that if we're talking about

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,519
user experience

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,639
and ux design we're talking about

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,800
building experiences and interfaces

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,959
for the people using them you know we

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,120
want to get those positive emotions

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,279
we want it to be accessible we want our

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,440
users to trust us

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,519
and have empathy when using them and

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,800
when you juxtapose those with

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,720
words like invalidating and hurtful

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,440
and you know having someone's journey

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
not being reflected in the world

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
to me that's the whole answer is simply

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,320
that if

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,920
a user has come to my site or try to use

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,600
a tool i've created

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,880
and they feel invalidated by it then

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
they're probably not going to use that

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,639
tool they're certainly not going to

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,839
recommend it to somebody else

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,360
and i haven't left them with a very good

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,399
experience regardless of how good

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
that tool might be

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,279
um so next i'll dig in a little bit on

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,600
some of the assumptions we make about

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,600
our users and i know

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,519
uh we can talk and con unconscious bias

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,720
to death in this field a little bit but

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,000
i do want to touch on it

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,639
um because it's certainly important to

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
this

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,360
and and all of our work

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,680
um and really what i want to say is

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,920
everyone battles unconscious bias

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
you could be the most woke person in the

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,760
world

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,320
and still this kind of stuff works

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,160
itself

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,800
in and the reason why is because

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,279
everything we do is informed by our own

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,160
life experience

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,959
you know when i'm building out an

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
interface

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,800
the first person that i'm testing that

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,120
on is me

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,639
um or occasionally you know a co-worker

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
being like hey

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
i'm trying to do this do you think this

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
works and obviously of course we're

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,360
going through

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,639
a lot more tests and qa

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,279
specifically around uh accessibility and

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
usability

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,560
but as we're building tools the reality

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
is we're

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
we're the first person we're testing and

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,279
all we have there

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,320
is our own life experience and so

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,959
with an idea of unconscious bias and how

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
that can show up and work

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,959
this happened i guess a month or so ago

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
someone

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,720
did a little experiment and uploaded

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
both these

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,399
photos on the right to twitter to see

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,360
where the

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
twitter algorithm would fix would choose

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,279
as the focus point

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
and obviously in the case of this tweet

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,120
it shows uh

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,360
mitch mcconnell mcconnell in both cases

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,000
and a lot of people ended up doing a lot

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,720
of variations on this

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,519
where they changed cut thai colors or

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,639
using different

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,759
people and images uh

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,680
using different dress and uh every

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
variation it seemed to be kind of this

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
consistent theme

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,000
of this algorithm

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,199
choosing to to show white people over um

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,800
black people or people of color um

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,959
and you know i actually really enjoyed

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,639
enjoying might not be the right word but

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,839
reading some of the twitter developers

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,800
response to this and you know simply

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,800
saying that wow you know this is

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,360
something that we were actively trying

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,399
to work against um you know we ran this

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
through some

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,160
some bias testing to make sure that this

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
wasn't the case but obviously we missed

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
something

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,839
we're going to take a look at it again

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
which to me is a perfect example of

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,000
this wasn't intentional this is

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
something they were actively working

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
to combat and it still happened which

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,799
again

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,280
is just simply that your own user

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,360
experience working

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
your own experience in the world working

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
its way into

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
an actual user's experience this is

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,760
another similar

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,600
case uh you know photo upload doesn't

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
meet criteria because the subject's eyes

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,280
are closed

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,960
um obviously the person's eyes are open

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,440
but if an algorithm is used to

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,240
isn't used to seeing that kind of image

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,240
or that kind of

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,960
look then obviously the algorithm is not

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
going to know

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,440
to recognize that and again this is

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,120
something that

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,120
is unintentional um

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
unintentional and just kind of result

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
the way it is and the only reason i

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,160
bring these up

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
is simply to say

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,840
it's okay to like make mistakes we're we

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,160
all

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
are not going to be perfect every single

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,600
time and the best we can do

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,120
is be aware of it uh and

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
quite simply the best way to

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,760
to realize how to fix these problems is

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,640
to realize that you do make assumptions

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,559
about users

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,559
i make assumptions about users all the

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,640
time

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,559
i usually make assumptions that they

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,000
will be more intuitive that they are

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,320
but it's something all of us uh

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,559
do as developers and i'm actually going

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,039
to skip over the next slide

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,720
um and with all that

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,080
it just boils down to we don't know what

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,440
we don't know

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,600
so i think many of you

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
like me growing up probably grew up with

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,960
the idea that there are two genders

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,000
male and female that's it um

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,120
that's what i knew to be true until

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,880
three or four years ago

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,640
so personally you know if i was creating

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,960
a form it would never occur to me

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,720
to give any option other than male or

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
female

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
and i know that's the case for a lot of

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,520
people now

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,000
is you don't know what you don't know

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,640
and if you've never thought about there

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
being a

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,360
third or fourth or different option on

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,400
gender fields

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,880
then that's okay it's not criticism it's

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
it's simply a way to learn and become

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
more informed

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,320
and try and find ways that you can

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,360
create these user experiences and kind

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
of

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,840
um put aside that assumption that you've

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,039
carried

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,039
for however many years

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,480
um so with a lot of that context

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,480
uh and definition kind of things

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:07,039
we have i'll dig into asking why

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,799
before how and what i mean here is

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,880
the question of how do we make this

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,960
gender field

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,559
as inclusive as possible which is a

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,000
great question to ask

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,320
and one that i love to see people ask

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,799
but before we get there we need to start

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,120
with why do we need to ask for this

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,720
at all and again this talk is specific

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,400
to gender

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,240
but this you know can be anything why do

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
we need to ask for users race why do we

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,039
need to ask for their age

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,600
why are we asking for this data from our

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,960
user

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
and how are we going to use it

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
and more importantly how is that

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,760
information

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
going to create a better experience for

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,480
the user

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,919
if they offer that information to us we

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,559
need to be using it

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,520
uh in an effective way um so a lot of

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,000
things that come up

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
uh specifically to gender in this regard

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,200
is demographics

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,320
um so obviously a lot of

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
all of us i think get demographics on

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,960
who is using our our site who's using

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,120
our tool

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,080
um and the question to dig in there is

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,440
why is gender specifically important in

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,720
that demographic data

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,840
so let's say you pull data and

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,600
you find out that 75 of your users

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,720
identify as male okay that's great

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,799
what are you going to do with that

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,600
information is it

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,200
well since most of our users are male we

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,720
need to

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,960
appeal to them more by having a more

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,520
masculine design maybe

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
but at that point what about your other

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,320
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,240
users that aren't male are you going to

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,360
choose to do something that might

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,280
off-put them

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,720
to appeal to that

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,200
larger demographic um is that really the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,360
most effective thing to be basing

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,799
designs off of and that's just kind of

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,120
an off

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,480
the cut cuff um example

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,480
but simply put

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,559
how are you using that data are using an

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,400
effective way and if you're not

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
challenge why you're asking for it

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
jonathan i see you said here that

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
there's a parallel here with responsible

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,919
data collection

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
um if you're going to plan some send

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
someone a coupon during their birthday

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,480
night the

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,320
month the only detail to collect this

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,080
month not the full

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,200
birth date um and to be intentional

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
and inclusive when collecting

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,039
information and you're absolutely right

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,720
um all of that plays in here

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,559
is stopping and asking

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,240
why are we asking for this data how are

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
we using it and like i said

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,400
you know it's a perfect example jonathan

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,200
that this applies way beyond

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,799
gender um and obviously it's just my

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,919
specific focus

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,720
another example uh is legal in medical

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,799
records

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,799
um so

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,400
yeah you know let's say you're filling

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,440
out medical records for your doctor's

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
office online

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,320
um obviously you're really concerned

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,320
about security and privacy in that case

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,400
um and that's a perfect example of

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
perhaps you should be asking for sex

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
instead of gender

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
um because more than likely that's the

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,080
information you need

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,280
and if a person's sex is the information

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
you need

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,760
then that's the information you ask for

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,240
um which kind of leads the

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,840
the last question there is if you're

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,799
using that gender field to deduce

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
something

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,320
if you're trying to figure out pronouns

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,480
don't

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
just try and figure it out based off one

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,679
field ask

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,679
specifically for the information you

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,919
need and more importantly

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,919
tell the user why you're asking for it

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,520
and as a personal aside

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,039
uh you can tell the user why you're

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,559
asking for it but

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,159
it also really helps if it's a

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,640
compelling reason i know

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,039
recently i was going through a signup

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,000
form with a streaming service and gender

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,440
was a required

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
field and it had a little

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,679
uh i could hover and see why are we

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,760
asking for this information

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,360
it's like well we're asking to give you

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,720
a more

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,840
personalized um set of recommendations

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,320
on what to watch

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,200
which to me was just not a good enough

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,200
reason because

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,799
for me i don't know how they could

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,039
possibly construe

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,279
what i want to watch based off of my

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,039
gender so

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,960
it's think about why you need that

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,240
information and

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,760
also making that a compelling case uh

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,840
to your user and like i said this is a

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
conversation that we have a lot on our

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,159
team

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,600
and actually led us to make a tool

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,400
around this

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,960
um called should i ask for gender which

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
is just

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,760
simply as should i ask for gender.com

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,799
uh and the idea there is

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,840
folks can go through a quiz

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,679
uh it'll take you to an answer that said

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,120
no you should avoid asking for gender

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,600
and here's why

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,559
or yes you have a great use case or

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
maybe

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,919
but here are some things to consider and

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,039
along with that

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,720
providing some resources uh and a

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,039
glossary

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,760
of terms to help people understand

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,000
things more

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,880
and you know one of the goals we had in

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,720
creating this

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,919
was simply to create

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,400
a more accessible and easy or easy as

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,400
can be

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,960
tool that folks can share with other

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,080
people

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,320
so the day after

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,120
we launched this uh i had a friend text

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,919
me

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,799
and say hey i'm working on this site

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,600
with a client

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,039
um i think it was like a high school or

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,080
something

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,279
and their interest form

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,039
uh has gender on it what what should

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,799
that look like do you think we even need

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,720
that there and i was like oh my gosh

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,240
your timing is perfect let me

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,679
send you this website um because it has

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,840
some of the resources that will be

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,520
helpful that you can then you know

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,480
share with your client which was awesome

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,679
and thanks guys for that feedback

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,279
definitely

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,360
excited about creating that tool

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,120
and hopefully making it a little bit

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,960
easier for people to ask that question

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,960
and help other people think about it

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:53,279
uh in the last section here is

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,840
thinking beyond the form field in terms

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,679
of user experience so again

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,159
i think the very well-intentioned good

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,440
question people ask is how do i

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,640
create this inclusive form field that's

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,679
great

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,720
and that's good but user experience

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,039
extends far beyond that

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,400
form field um and to illustrate this

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,080
i just want you to think about user

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,919
story as

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,279
users realize the new gender identity

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,320
and they're going through the process

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,799
and they've changed their name um

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159
obviously using a different gender

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,200
they've changed their email

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:35,520
to align with the new name they've had

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,360
for themselves and simply

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,679
are you equipped to handle that and

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,679
you would think that most people would

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,000
say yes that seems like a very obvious

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,120
thing i should be able to be handled

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,159
but you would be surprised at how

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,520
difficult

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,679
this is in some places so some questions

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,799
to think of here to reduce the friction

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,480
uh for users going through this is can

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,440
users update their data

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,240
are you giving them edit access on their

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
own data

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,279
so you know i've run into

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,279
a name field not being editable

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,200
more times than i think i could even

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,480
count at this

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,440
at this point um and sometimes

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,919
depending if it depending on the service

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,559
it might require a phone call

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,360
which i'm a millennial i don't like

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,520
phone calls

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,880
if i can't do it online i get i get

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,080
really grouchy

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,520
um but you know sometimes it happens

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
but that is all part of the user

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,399
experience is if i'm going through your

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,480
site

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,039
and trying to find a way to change my

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,000
name and i realize i'm going to have to

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,039
call you and figure

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,679
it out i'm not feeling great

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,159
i'm feeling a little bit grumpy versus

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,159
just being able to

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
change it there with an online form in

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,200
the same place that i created the

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
profile

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,640
another thing to think about in reducing

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,679
that friction is this is a repeated

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,000
action

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,279
so we talked about how many form fields

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,320
you grow up

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,320
you fill out any year

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,480
think about how many profiles you have

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,159
that exist

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,120
and you have to change your name and

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,360
your email on all of them

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,360
all with different processes so

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,440
my challenge is always to strive to be

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,760
the pleasant surprise

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,520
uh throughout that process so you know

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,880
while users are slogging through

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,720
and on the phone and sending off emails

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
whatever the case may be

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,880
be the one that makes it really easy you

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,640
can stop and smile and be like oh

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
thank you for this thank you for this

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,320
gift of my time

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960
because we don't want our users to be

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,159
stuck

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,200
and encountering friction and not being

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,480
able to get through things

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,080
and with that is

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
challenging the process and affecting

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,120
change at higher levels

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
so a lot of times a phone call is

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,279
required

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,799
is because they need to run it through

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,480
some other department

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,960
or someone specifically has to make that

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,960
change

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,120
as people building the sites as people

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
building or advocating for a product

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,600
i always advocate that we take on that

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,559
burden the burden should be on us there

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,720
not on our users um you know giving the

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,720
users a simple form that says give us

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,240
all this information

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
here's how it's gonna go we'll let you

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,080
know what happens

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
the terrible voice wrecking yeah yes

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,320
nothing worse than calling customer

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
service

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
i agree with you you all in the chat for

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,399
sure

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,960
uh and finally in terms of reducing

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,200
friction is propagation so when i hit

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,279
save on that form

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
i assume that that change is going to be

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,600
visible

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
everywhere across that site and

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,640
especially in the page that i'm on

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,440
and surprisingly that doesn't happen all

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
the time

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
uh kathleen said one of the designers

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,399
avoid

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
asking for gender how do you make sure

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,000
you don't fall into

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,919
there are no women on the internet issue

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,279
i tend to find gender isn't directly

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,320
specified online and people

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,519
default to assuming everyone is male

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,519
yes absolutely

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,600
and i think

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,120
that's a good question um and it's the

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,000
same thing you know when you look at

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,039
unisex t-shirts unisex t-shirts or

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,200
male t-shirts um a lot of things default

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,799
to mail on the internet

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,039
and i think you know one of the easiest

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,640
ways

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,480
to figure out if you are is having

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,679
women and females involved in the

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,799
process which

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,679
obviously speaks to one of the issues we

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,080
have in this industry is is diversity

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,679
and

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,679
having people in the room that can

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,320
they can understand and

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,720
point out uh where some things might you

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,919
know be defaulting to a male perspective

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,360
and i guess you know the other thing

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
that i would always challenge people to

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,039
is if you are

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
using that demographic data in a

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,559
specific way

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,159
and notice that 75 percent of my users

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,360
are male and only 25

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,840
are female perhaps the data usage there

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,919
isn't

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,279
in how can i serve the majority of my

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,279
audience it's

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,240
asking how can i serve this minority

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,799
and get more people that don't identify

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,480
as male

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,480
to to use my product or site or service

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
legal name changes um are kind of a

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,440
different animal and i don't think

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,360
in most case would be something that

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
we would be handling in open source

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,279
projects but

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,279
banks in particular medical services

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
mostly banks it feels like have legal

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,480
name changes

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,720
but if that is ever something you run

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,640
into universities for sure

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,360
um if someone's changed their name

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,399
legally they have documentation

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,960
um they already have it like that's just

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,960
what happens when you change your name

00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
legally

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,640
so the user is always going to be able

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,600
to verify

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,440
that legal name change and you just need

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,960
to give them an avenue to be able to do

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,320
that

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,080
and of course going back to asking why

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,440
do you need a legal name if you just

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,559
need to know what to call them

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,120
ask for your name ask for their name

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,399
uh and then always keep in mind that

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,559
a lot of times people ask for a

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:59,600
preferred name and i know a lot of folks

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,039
uh get really put off by that and the

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,799
idea that

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,279
names not a preference it's it's just

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,279
their name

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,359
so i see a lot of ways people get around

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,240
this

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,159
is simply asking what do we call you or

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,280
what name do you go by

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,520
or something similar to that

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,399
and having that be your primary source

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,440
for the name

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,000
versus you know the legal one

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,440
and only using that legal information

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,599
where it needs to be changed

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,359
it's a good example of a user-friendly

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,119
process in this regard

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,560
is paypal where next your name they have

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,240
a little thing that says do you need to

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,000
change your name

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,040
uh and you can choose between

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,720
uh updating you know a nickname making a

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,440
minor correction or changing your legal

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,879
name

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
now change your legal name

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
they say upload your id upload your

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,760
documentation

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,760
and we'll handle it and that's exactly

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,520
the kind of user experience i think we

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
need to strive for is

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,880
i'm sure paypal has to do something on

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,720
their back end to push that through and

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,400
make it all official

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,119
but the point is that they're taking

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,760
that burden and not putting it

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,520
on the user and furthermore they're even

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,119
giving you an option

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,119
to upload it from your phone too

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,880
uh frustrating processes from my own

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,079
personal experience

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,480
and i think if you're in this chat these

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,960
are probably not things that

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,800
you're um encountering or have to run

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,839
into but

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,240
simply uh one credit card company

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,960
i was trying to change my name with i

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,680
literally

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,359
could not do it i felt terrible for the

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,119
person i was talking to on the phone

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,520
because she was trying

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,760
so so hard and realized that she just

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,119
like did not have the power to change my

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,359
first name

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,480
and so ultimately i had to send them a

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,839
letter

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,240
via snail mail saying what i needed

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,160
which as far as user experience goes is

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,480
pretty

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,680
horrifying if i have to drop something

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,200
in the mail

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,880
and wait uh a full week or

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,320
whatever it is and you know if you

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,839
contrast that with a different credit

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
card company where i send a secure

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,839
message

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,560
and they're like okay great um

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,880
another one was a utility company their

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,839
online portal

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,960
i had to go get a form notarized

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,520
verifying that my

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
certified court order of a name change

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,040
was

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
a certified court order i've never

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,200
figured that one out

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,079
again as far as user experience goes if

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,280
i have to go to a bank

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,800
and send you a form then i'm frustrated

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,040
um and then there's one account where

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
it's just impossible for me to change my

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,800
name

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,920
period still haven't done it um

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,520
so it's things like those that if you're

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,359
asking for these things that this is a

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,680
consideration you're making is you know

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,680
when i say beyond the form field

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,400
this is the stuff that i mean is that

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,960
it's not just i've asked you for your

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,960
gender in a responsible way

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
but that i've created a really positive

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,160
user experience for you

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,640
throughout my entire site and beyond the

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,440
site

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,920
and just with you know our organization

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,920
as a whole

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,280
so for the summary the too long didn't

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
read version

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,680
have a compelling reason to ask for

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,960
gender explain to the user

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,200
why you're asking for it

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,480
give users the control to change their

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,560
information

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,680
put that process in place reduce the

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,839
friction

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,240
as much as possible check on your

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,320
assumptions

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,960
uh you know even if you can't relate to

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,800
a person's life experience

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,720
do what you can to understand and

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,320
empathize with them and figure out what

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,440
you can do

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,960
to make them have a good experience

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,160
with with your your product

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,040
and last you know these trans and

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,800
non-gender non-conforming folks exist

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,839
they're using tools they're using

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
products every day

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,240
um and their experience matters just as

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,359
much

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,920
as the next person so

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,400
that is what i've got and obviously

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,160
already

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,560
some discussion in the chat there and

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,119
definitely happy to

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,400
open it up to more questions with the

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,400
last few minutes we have here

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:47,839
thank you maria

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,079
jonathan yes names are not a preference

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,839
preferred pronouns is

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,839
definitely another pet peeve that comes

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
up

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,839
thank you so much lucia

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,000
i definitely agreed there gail

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,640
um i'm really fortunate to work for a

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,200
place that

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,400
is focused so much on inclusivity and

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,920
hopefully it's something that

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,040
uh we can keep bringing

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,280
to people in the future um

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,960
let's see uh do you have any resources

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,240
for new devs to learn more

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,920
somebody asked and

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,920
i do let me

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,839
pull up a couple options so i mentioned

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,079
that

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,079
um

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,400
that medium article that had some of the

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,920
user stories there

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,920
i'll paste that in

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,839
i think this is a really good resource

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,079
i also saw mention on the gender bread

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,079
person

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,480
paste that in and actually i think my

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,440
best

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,920
collection of resources in regards to

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
this

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,200
is on that should i ask for gender

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,280
website i'll also paste in

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,280
uh and the resources here really go

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,800
through

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
you know a lot of things that are

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,200
specific to um

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
clips

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,200
to development

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,440
some are simply like glossary terms

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,240
transgender lots of different things but

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:21,839
that's

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:21,839
kind of my best set of resources

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
india yeah checking accounts uh looking

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
into processes for updating personal

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,839
information

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,839
it's a it's a wild ride

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,240
uh let's see with the number of options

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,079
for gender and pronouns

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,280
feels like a free text input is the best

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,880
way to let people provide their

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,040
information

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,000
are there some best practices for

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,040
reconciling

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,119
information and aggregate um

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,319
other concern is users who needs to use

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,160
those fields

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,760
yeah and this is what's really

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,839
challenging is

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,520
with that many gender identities

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,560
it it is incredibly difficult to have a

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,119
free text field

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,839
um in large part because the data

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,359
storage

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,920
is so challenging and actually

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,440
this um principles for inclusive gender

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,480
inputs

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,880
i really like the process they go

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,480
through

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,400
here and actually creating fields

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,520
kind of like this one that are

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,520
multi-select field

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,960
where you have the option of adding one

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,280
uh that might not be there

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,280
um

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,000
i i think that i've struggled a little

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,839
bit with the free text fields

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,680
i'll have to

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,599
i feel like i at some point had

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,480
something

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,599
uh had read something pretty concrete um

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,040
outside of that

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,040
on on ways to handle it but there are

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,119
uh some resources out there that'll give

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,520
you a list of

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,160
of possible fields to to fill a select

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,160
box but

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,880
yeah i think the best we can do in terms

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,960
of combating against

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,400
people who are providing hurtful or

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,880
mocking kind of information

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,400
is um you know filtering out

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,160
some words you know words that we know

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,880
to be derogatory which

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:45,200
is a huge pain on the developer side um

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,960
or yeah you know

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,960
part of the problem is aggregating it is

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,760
just a tough

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,200
uh from that developer perspective and

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,839
actually i do remember

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,240
the resource that was good there which

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,240
is

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,200
and this article when binary code won't

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,640
accommodate non-binary people is

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,240
actually

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,760
what got me started down that path so

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,760
that might be a good read

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,599
gonna be very predictive

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,800
uh yeah multiple choice options male

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,599
female other

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,000
um i think for me

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
gender field should always be optional i

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,960
think that

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,200
is 100 of the time and kind of one of

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,599
the most important things you can do

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,720
um and i think there's a case for

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,640
obviously male female

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,160
if it is a required field at least

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,119
having the option of prefer not to

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,839
answer

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,920
um i like to avoid the word other

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,240
because

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,240
um

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,280
nobody wants to like be considered an

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,040
other

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,880
so another thing i've seen people do a

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,720
lot is uh

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
you know male female and then having a

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,000
radio option for

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,640
self-identify and if you select that

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,599
option

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,359
um a text field can appear that they can

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:33,839
put in their own custom input so that's

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:33,839
another option as well

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,359
thank you for having me you're here we

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,119

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,680
absolutely it was a pleasure i always

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,800
like

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,760
um sharing the good word and talking

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,839
about it especially with some

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,839
like-minded folks which it looks like we

00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,839
have

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,520
