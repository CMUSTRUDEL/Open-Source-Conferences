Abstract: Great technology starts with great code—and achieving great code starts with every individual having a seat at the table. It’s the diversity of perspective, expertise, and experience working in concert that makes transformative innovations come to life. Creating an inclusive environment for diverse communities is the key to pushing technology forward—and there’s work to be done. We only have 24% of computing jobs with women, and almost 70% of the coding community is traditionally white. With the help of technology, coders can build diversity and equality in their profession—and uplift underrepresented communities in this space. The time is now to foster a diverse community of coders that can push technology to new heights.

Join Ndu Emuchay, IBM Fellow, IBM Services Cloud Transformation and members of many other organizations focused on underrepresented communities as they discuss the role technology can play to help aid and accelerate racial justice. They will also address the importance of diversity in STEM to advance innovation and equality. Ndu will also share exciting news about diverse and new open source communities and how you – developers, organizations, and concerned global citizens – can get involved now to be part of tangible change that we want to see today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.

wherever you're joining us from

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
i'm an ibm fellow cloud transformation

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
and engineering

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
at ibm i lead work with some of our

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,880
largest clients

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
really to help them reimagine the future

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,599
to drive transformation at

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
enterprise scale over the last eight

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
months or so i've been

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
leading work around technology for good

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
we call it

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
tech for good under the ibm embrace

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,239
initiative

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
cloud computing of course features there

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,480
and

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
as well as other technologies that i'm

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,039
sure we'll be speaking about

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
emphasis today though would be around

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
technology

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,960
and the role technology can play to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,359
really drive and accelerate racial

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
justice and then secondly the importance

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,039
of diversity

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
in stem to advance innovation and

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,119
equality

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,080
and then what i'll like to do is

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,520

my panel i think one of our panelists is

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,159
having technical difficulty

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
but we will get to the panel they'll do

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
a short

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,360
introduction of the work they're leading

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,960
in these two particular areas

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
and then i will make some opening

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280

gonna be introducing

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,120
um some more information about the

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
announcement we made yesterday as part

of this

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
important conference it's around call

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
for code for racial justice

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
to begin we declare that black lives

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,039
matter

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,080
period and then given all the events in

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,199
the u.s

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,479
ibm's from all walks of life especially

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,759
black ibmers

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,240
and their allies really got together

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
in their despairing their frustration in

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,199
the exhaustion

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
at a moment of clarity we really decided

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
to apply all of the leading technologies

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
and

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,199
applying our ingenuity our hopes our

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
aspirations to address

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
the problem of systemic racism really to

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
just

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
to drive sustained and enduring change

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,199
in order to

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,400
do this we actually over the past

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,639
number of months at ibm had an

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,520
internal initiative called embrace

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,880
embrace

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,600
call for code challenge we had over

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,440
500 ibm's who are passionate uh

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
visionaries around the world

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
really bring their talent uh the the

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
passion the design

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
the creativity that that brought really

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,160
to drive

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,080
systemic change um within

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
uh the solutions that we announced

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
yesterday i'll be going into a bit more

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
detail

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
on what those solutions are but they are

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
in three

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
broad areas police and judicial reform

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,440
and accountability

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
diverse representation and then thirdly

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,360
policy

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,080
and legislation reform what we're doing

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
as part of all things open is that we

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,160
are

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,800
contributing these solutions to the

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,120
world

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
really to you developers uh we invite

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
invite you to join with us

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,199
join with our partners who are driving

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
a real change we know you're already

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
doing your part

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,319
but our goal is really to accelerate

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,039
the change to really address and go to

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
the core

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
of systemic racism as part of this

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
initiative

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
we want to make sure that we do this in

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
an aspirational way we want to make sure

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,000
that we

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,240
are able to be authentic about this we

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
want to make sure that the change is

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360
both local in your communities

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,400
as well as global as as needed

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
because call for code for racial justice

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,639
is not a

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,720
finite definition of solutions or even a

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,759
finite definition of challenges

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
we will be providing new solutions in

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,240
the future with your help

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,240
the goal for us is to drive adoption to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,280
drive innovation to combat

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,240
systemic racism wherever it exists

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,039
around the world on the core of call for

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
code

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,319
what this really is is about empowerment

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,199
of individual developers

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
yourselves about innovators about social

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
justice

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,440
advocates like yourselves we want to

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
drive sustained impact

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,800
at a global scale and that's really the

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,159
point of

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
this conversation we're going to be

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,519
having with our esteemed

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
panelists now as developers you actually

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,399
are able to make a stand you're able to

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
answer the call for code you're able to

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,920
really dive in

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
and see what this begins to look like

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
you're able to make a commitment to

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
adopt some of these technologies that we

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,000
speak about today

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,760
what i'll do uh briefly um is actually

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
share my screen with you just so you see

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,680
what this begins to look like

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
i'm going to show you the real

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
capability

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
that we're donating uh to the rest of

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
the world

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,680
to yourselves in order to actually drive

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,760
the kind of change

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,519
that we speak that we speak about give

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,120
me one second to just share my screen so

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,120
you see what this begins to look like

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
all right so you can see my screen right

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
now and what i'll do is

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
ask some of my colleagues at ibm to drop

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,440
the links

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
in the zoom chart as well so what i'm

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
showing you here

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,640
is part of the announcement we made

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,000
you'll have access to the links

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,680
and then i'll take you to the actual

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,680
projects and these projects are

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,680
these ones that you see here and you'll

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,920
see

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,000
you know open sentencing for example is

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
one that begins to drive

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
visibility transparency around

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,000
sentencing

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
i'll show you what that begins to look

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
like in terms of

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,560
the git repository so you actually see a

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,440
fully fledged

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,440
solution starter set and with all the

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,880
resources that one might need and all

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
the documentation

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,399
to help scaffold the basic ideas and

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,160
developers right now you on the call can

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,440
jump in and actually begin to

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
participate

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
in an open way to really drive the power

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,680
of open

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
around these solutions the next one i'm

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
going to show you is around

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,320
incident accuracy reporting system again

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,440
this is the git

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
repo we're going to drop the links in

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
the zoom chart so you can actually have

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
direct access to them

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,680
i show you this really to

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,720
kind of indicate that these are real

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,880
solution building blocks if you like

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
where they're not fully fledged but the

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
whole idea

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
for open is that with your ingenuity

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,560
with your

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,600
passion with your drive we

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,720
together can make a significant change

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,200
in how social change occurs

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
here's another one i won't go into all

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
of the detail but you'll see

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,000
five solutions starter starter kits

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,720
really laid out and then with uh detail

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
on exactly how you might participate so

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,959
i'm gonna

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,399
want to thank you very much i'll stop

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,640
sharing my screen here

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
and then we'll go back to we'll go back

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
to the panelists uh what i'm interested

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
in

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,519
in knowing from the panelists is

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
you know how have we um within the work

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,120
you've done

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
uh in the companies that you lead how

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
have we

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,800
actually um brought the spotlight to

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
this moment to drive the change and then

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,120
how might we sustain

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,959
uh such change going forward i'm going

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
to start with anisha and then before

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,920
that i'm going to actually congratulate

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,200
anisha black

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
girls code for the original award that

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
you

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,040
won yesterday um this is awesome work

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
and i congratulate you again but anisha

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,880
any thoughts on

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
this moment uh how we capture the moment

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,920
how we

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
ensure momentum and then how we make

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,480
change happen uh going forward

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
sure thank you so thank you to you and

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
ibm

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
for the for the regional award we are

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,160
definitely proud of that work

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,639
um and as far as what we've done thus

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,079
far

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
in order to respond to the moment i

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,680
think black girls club we realize

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
with code in the name that we had to be

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
leaders around how we're providing

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,240
virtual education for our students right

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,839
how do we move from that in person

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
interactions that was really driving

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
this the foundation of our program to

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,560
virtual so i think

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,079
we've had an opportunity to work to be

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
leaders around

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,720
uh that that virtual transition one in

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
just responding to the pandemic reality

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
um of our lives and then two in

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,839
responding to

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
the racial moment um that america seems

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,720
to be in i think we've really

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
tried to work with partners so we've had

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,160
a lot of outreach

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,519
from organizations from companies to say

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
all right we realize we need to do

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
better

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
um we need to be more mindful of how

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,279
we're recruiting black women we need to

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
be sure that we're supporting

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,399
black women within this tech industry

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,839
and so i think the work

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
we've done is trying to be really

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,040
thoughtful about identifying those

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,160
partners we want to work with people who

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,399
are not doing it for the the media hits

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,399
um in the midst of you know the moment

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,880
we want to identify partners who are

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
invested in partnering with us over the

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600
long run not just for this year not for

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
this quarter

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
but have an idea and have support that

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
they want to implement for

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
black women in the coding space over the

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
next few years

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
because it's going to take a long road

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
of work to address the inequities that

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,360
exist within the tech industry

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
um and even within stem education so

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,760
we we are not looking for partners who

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
who just want to dip in and dip out

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,959
of this commitment and so i think

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,240
identifying partners writing partners

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,199
and then creating some long-term

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
strategies

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,560
um in partnership with those with those

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,680
partners i feel like i can't say

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,360
partners any more times

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,959
but um but uh

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
and i think one way that we're really

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,120
focusing on doing those

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
extended uh engagements is through

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,279
internships

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
so having folks actually take on um

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
students and have them brought into

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
their company teaching them leading them

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
and hopefully creating new leaders for

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
their companies and then also through

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
mentoring so we work with a lot of

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
companies there's a lot of interest

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,079
thankfully

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,680
with folks who want to partner with our

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,279
students directly um

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
share some guidance and then we know

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,000
that mentoring can happen not just on a

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,839
adult to student but adult adult um

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
situation and so figuring out how we can

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
also

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,760
collaborate with our partners to

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,880
identify mentoring on the professional

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
landscape as well

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
to keep that again extended engagement

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,600
over time

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:45,839
that is fantastic so so same question to

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,839
justin justin what are your thoughts

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,760
justin can you hear us

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,639
ah sounds like justin might have

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
technical difficulty again

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,160
let's go to uh christina then uh

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,519
christine any thoughts on this

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
particular

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,600
topic of uh really understanding the

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,440
mormon and then driving momentum going

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,839
forward

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,480
yeah thanks you know i think it's a

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,639
really

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
critically important moment and we

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,120
welcome this great initiative

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:25,440
um of ibm uh i i feel that there is

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:29,120
a renewed uh passion

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,759
a new movement which is now a global

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,800
protest of people standing up and saying

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,680
you know we must

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,839
fight racism so we have to really grab

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
hold of this moment and make sure that

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
if there is

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,920
a continued effort that it isn't just a

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,079
moment but that it is really a movement

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,120
and that it continues until we achieve

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,880
the goal of real equality um which is

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,040
what we're fighting for

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,480
and in this context the un and

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,880
particularly the human rights office

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
we've been working for nearly 20 years

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
since the world conference against

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,000
racism

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,440
which was held in durban south africa

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
and that provided

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
a lot of political commitments from

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,279
different governments

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
um on what they said they were going to

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
do

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
to improve the world to combat racism

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,600
racial discrimination

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,600
xenophobia related intolerance and

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
i think now as we're coming to the 20th

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
anniversary of

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
the world conference against racism i

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
think it's a really good moment to look

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,079
at it again

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
and to see how far we've come and and

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,959
what you find is that a lot of the

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
measures which were recommended and

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
agreed upon by member states at that

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,320
time

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,720
are still extremely relevant today um

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
so we have a lot of work to do in terms

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
of implementation

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
we also have international human rights

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
law

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
which provides a really robust framework

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,720
for addressing

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,959
systemic racism so we just need to

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
get the support and i think already

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,120
there is a movement

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
that's happening globally so we need to

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
make sure that

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,640
it actually results in real change

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,480
and real and i think through the work

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,480
of everyone on this call um

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
it's how it's how we can actually get

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
there

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,360
through everyone's initiative

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
at every single level um throughout the

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
work that they do

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,120
to make sure that the message goes out

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,760
loud and clear that we really must

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
now turn to implementation ensuring that

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,080
the human rights

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,960
for everybody is really protected

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,679
and use these instruments that we have

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
use the

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,760
international human rights law framework

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
which puts an emphasis on

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,400
the victims making sure that they're the

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,880
center of everything that we do

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
and uh and holding perpetrators

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,679
accountable

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,160
in order to really achieve just this

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
once and for

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,280
absolutely thank you so much christian i

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,039
think

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
just walking shoulder to shoulder

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,640
understanding that we've got to get to

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
implementation

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
knowing that the long game is what this

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,520
is all about

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
while we drive the immediate steps in

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
the moment i think those are a really

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
critical point

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,880
stephanie any additional thoughts on

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
this question and then we'll get into

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,360
the the stem question which anisha

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,520
indicated as well that's stephanie

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,280
yeah i found it super insightful for

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,200
christina to mention that there needs to

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,520
be work on multiple levels

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
yes right so all across the spectrum

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
ranging from

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
you know youth all the way up into

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
adults

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,360
and i think that um could with klossy in

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,400
particular is doing a really well job

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,240
in in incorporating more girls um

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,360
specifically more people of color

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,799
into these fields and giving them a warm

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
and welcoming introduction to these

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,160
types of fields that are

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,760
now dominated and lack a lot of

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,880
diversity

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,039
um and so the importance of that is

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
uh we are we are starting to create a

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,760
community of girls of

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,600
uh people of color who have intentions

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
of using computer science for social

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
good

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,400
or to work on certain issues that tackle

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
you know racism in our country for

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,960
example and this is all important

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,280
because i really believe

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
in the power of the youth you know the

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
power in the new generation to create

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
change

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
um it's really in our hands to move

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,559
forward to move to transition in a world

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
that actively wants to become

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,799
anti-racist

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,799
um and i think this is incredibly

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,760
important especially taking into account

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,080
that we need to reach

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
um to our youth and make sure that

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
they're included in these conversations

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,440
so i just wanted to add that

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,200
you know one way that cooperative klossy

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
is trying to keep momentum within their

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
small community

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,960
is by creating a platform um so alumni

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
can come back and feel a support that

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,559
like have a support and a network of

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,559
people that they can

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,480
um you know lean on in order to create

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,400
change in whatever way they wish um

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,000
at whatever level they they're able to

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:09,440
do so

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,240
that's excellent uh stephanie um justin

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,960
do you have your uh tech issues resolved

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,559
now

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,799
i do i do fantastic so justin i'll do

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,600
this right so you'll take that question

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,440
and then

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
as well as that question perhaps you can

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,799
broach the subject

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,520
why hasn't this worked so far um if

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,799
this were easy i'm sure we will not be

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
having this conversation but what are

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,640
the thoughts about

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
some of the constraints or some of um

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
you know

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
some of the issues that have come in the

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,880
way of this becoming uh

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,760
just uh business as usual yeah and i'm

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
happy to actually

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,480
answer kind of both questions at once um

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
so i think because i've missed i

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
apologize i missed the pound some of the

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,640
uh responses from the panel

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,159
um our computer decided to restart um

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
love hate relationship with technology

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
right so

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,159
um the i think the the first thing is

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,080
greater intentionality and and i think

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,919
anisha you pointed this out

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
perfectly which is it has to be a

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,120
multi-year strategic approach

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,000
to getting people and organizations

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
engaged

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,159
um and doing it in a very intentional

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,919
way so building it into the strategy

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
not as a bolt-on that is something that

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,000
that is purely just added on

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,679
for um for the the sake of doing the the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,080
work in that way but more

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
like understanding that is imperative to

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,679
the the strategic growth of the company

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
if you want to be a 100 plus year

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,120
company a 200 plus year company

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
uh these are things that you're going to

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
have to address at some point and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,159
there's no time like the present right

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,440
and so i think that's the

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
the first thing is greater

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,960
intentionality um that's what we've

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,320
really focused our efforts on and our

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
energy on at

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
collab and some of the organizations

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
that i've founded in the past is

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
high intention so i think that's the

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,360
first part um

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
why i think it hasn't worked thus far is

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,440
because

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,280
um for two core reasons one uh the lack

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,240
of intentionality i think

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,200
um is a big part you know when things

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
become

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,799
you know i think what kobe did is it

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,760
illuminated it it gave us the world kind

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
of slowed down just

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,200
enough for us to shine a spotlight or

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
brighter spotlight on something that has

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
been

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,440
played that's plagued this country for

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,919
honestly centuries um

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,200
and so that's the first thing but i also

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
think that the goal posts

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
sometimes moved and i think that we

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,799
we're going to talk about this a little

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,960
bit later but i think

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,880
that when we talk about access and we

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
talk about skills you know

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,799
we have to understand that this is a

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
system where uh whenever there's an

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
opportunity

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,440
um people of diverse backgrounds people

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,679
of color women

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,280
they all they will always actively do

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
the things necessary to

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
to earn their way um to have a spot at

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,039
those tables

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,559
but then the rules of the room change

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,360
again just as we

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,280
as we get to a place where there might

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
be some equitability and some parity

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
so i think that why these things haven't

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,720
worked is because

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,159
uh you know once upon a time it was you

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
know you needed to have a high school

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
diploma to get a job then it was a

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,760
degree to get a job and now it's

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,360
you have to have 70 years experience

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,159
maybe in the technology that's only five

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,159
years old like

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,080
we've seen these things happen before

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
you're like well how does one get a job

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,200
if you have to have seven years

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
experience in you know something with

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,720
only that's only been

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
active technology before five years so

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,640
there's there's this um

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,159
laddering and where the the ladder

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,320
continues to adjust and move

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
um within the rooms and then therefore

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,720
those that are trying to get access to

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
those rooms

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
um are at a disadvantage before they

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,799
even can kind of peek in the door

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
so i think we have to be mindful of our

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
biases i think we have to be mindful of

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
the

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
uh the moving of the goal post what you

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,559
know wherever it may be but understand

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
it is a layered

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,720
um thing that uh must be addressed at

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,400
every single level if you want to truly

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
have the impact that we all that we all

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
see

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,679
thank you very much justin very very

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,840
insightful indeed and anisha i want to

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,080
go back to you i think you touched on

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
stem i'm going to borrow from what

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,240
justin

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,000
just clearly laid out which is you know

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
despite all of the effort

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,320
um in increasing pipeline and sort of

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,039
all the investment and so forth

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
we still find that there is lack of

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,360
representation especially

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,880
in stem within the pipeline and even

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,799
within the workplace

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
what are the um what are the issues

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,000
around that from your perspective anisha

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,600
and then we'll come back to

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
the rest of the panel uh for their

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,559
perspective as well

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,400
sure i mean as as justin was talking i

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,480
had a thought and so technologists don't

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,480
hate me but i wonder if

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,640
uh the patience required for systemic

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,400
change is just antithetical sometimes to

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,640
the speed at which things must change

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,919
within technology right so i think i

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,679
think about developers i think about

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
engineers they they go and they see a

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,559
problem

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,320
they understand create a plan to to do

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,039
it and they enact that plan within you

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,360
know months

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,799
of you know conception to execution

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,159
potentially and so

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,400
the changes that we're talking about

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
diversifying um

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
an entire industry just based on gender

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
right before we even get into race and

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,960
ethnicity

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,720
um i think the industry just has a lot

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,039
of work to do on that front so

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,840
it's going to take long-term strategic

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,960
plans

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,880
from companies and from hiring folks and

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
from the industry in and of itself this

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
is not something we're going to turn

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,799
around

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
um in the matter of a year in the matter

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,679
of five years even uh you know for black

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
girls code

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,960
you know our goal is 2040. so we you

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
know when we started we made this

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,279
understanding that

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,520
um we are going to be able to impact a

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,039
million girls in 2040 which is

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,360
and then where did those girls go from

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,159
2014 where does the industry stand

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,960
um at that point so i think that's the

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,159
first one is that

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,600
i think the industry needs to have a

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,559
little bit more patience and then also

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,720
be creating

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,559
these longer term plans and i also

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
wonder how much thought

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,440
um the industry has given as far as like

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,200
how far back you start that pipeline

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,880
um you know i think it's easier to

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
partner with colleges right when that's

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,240
the space where you're recruiting

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
but college is too late um to begin to

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
think about diversity college is too

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
late to begin to think about

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
learning fundamental coding skills and

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,679
and even as

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,039
as there are some institutions of

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,400
organizations that are willing to take

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,840
kids right out of high school

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,679
we're finding that high school is also a

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
little too late for teaching and

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
building these foundations and so i

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,559
think we really need to

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
support and work with companies who are

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
willing to think about a 20-year

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
strategy

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,360
um and and go backwards in time to say

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
how do we connect with the middle school

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
how do we connect with elementary

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,600
schools

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,840
um because companies are going to be

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,960
building their current workforces

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,720
today um you know by by looking at seven

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,240
year olds and as the industry has grown

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
we have jobs today that we couldn't

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,200
fathom and imagine 35 years ago

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,799
i think we do need some support and

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,000
connection within the industry

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,000
to be thinking about what are the jobs

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,760
that we don't we can't even fathom 35

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,559
years out and how do we begin to build a

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,159
workforce

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,320
that can sustain and support that so i

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,320
think it goes to the pipeline issue of

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,840
how do we reach kids earlier and earlier

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,039
expose them teach them

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,200
give them the knowledge that they need

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,520
so that they can penetrate the industry

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,880
um and then how do we also you know as

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,000
we're doing that to help certain groups

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
of kids catch up

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,520
continue to be innovative and continue

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,960
to teach new technologies as they come

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,760
out to the growing population to speak

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
to i think

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,679
justin's point um earlier around you

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,720
know by the time you get into the room

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,120
the technology in that room is now dated

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
now you're trying to catch up and and

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
and learn whatever

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
new things out there so we have to

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,679
figure out how to make those resources

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,600
available to those

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,720
uh marginalized and underrepresented

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,120
communities as well

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,919
so yeah that's very well very well said

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,559
very well said

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,600
so christina let me uh come back to you

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,840
you talked about

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,000
frameworks and you talked about ways of

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,200
leveraging the tools that are available

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,720
to us i wonder how would you um

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,399
answer the question that those

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
frameworks might actually be

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,919
uh too rigid given the

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,679
dynamicity of the environment given the

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,320
changes the evolution of technology

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,480
given

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
what anisha rightly pointed out justin

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,440
too that

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,360
things are moving so quickly kind of

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,000
feels like the goalpost is

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,679
shifting and changing and the the ground

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,159
upon which we stand is

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,919
sort of evolving as we speak right at

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,919
times it's just the nature

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,919
of the framework itself because the

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,960
framework was set you know 10 years ago

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,880
it wasn't

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,799
quite designed to be flexible how do you

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,440
speak to that just in terms of the stem

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,080
question

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,520
and the flexibility needed to adapt

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,279
quickly and make sure that we're

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,480
recruiting we're building we're going

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,880
back and pulling

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
you know forward right um into the

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,279
future and

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,240
making sure that we're ready for the

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,120
future workforce

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,720
yeah so i mean i think that um what the

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,919
other speakers have spoken about a lot

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,600
is representation

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,960
and trying to combat barriers um racial

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,360
bias within the system

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
and i think that's that's a field which

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,080
uh is

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
is extremely important we need to

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,000
address racial stereotypes and

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,559
stereotyping wherever they exist

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,679
because they do create real barriers and

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,559
disparities

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
um so it's something which we're trying

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,000
to address within the un

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,760
um but of course we need partnerships we

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
need to be working with

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,360
with all those who care about this issue

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,679
to

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,960
get rid of racial stereotyping and

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
stereotypes

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,200
and to ensure that there is diversity

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,320
and there is true representation of all

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,120
communities

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,799
because we've seen through our work that

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,039
this makes a massive difference

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,120
if you have a diverse workforce if you

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,799
have true representation then they're

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,640
able to articulate

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,320
the concerns of different communities

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,520
they're able to address

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,039
the concerns in a much more um accurate

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,760
way so it's extremely important

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,840
um in in terms of you know whether the

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,240
frameworks are outdated

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,159
um i feel that they're not i feel that

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,640
even 20 years ago

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,679
when people were looking at the problems

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,960
of racism

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,559
they said that this issue is rooted

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,600
in a legacy of colonialism

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,320
and the trade enslaved africans which

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,679
has left with us

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,480
a legacy of racial injustice

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,039
which needs to be undone so i think we

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,399
still

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,200
as a world community have not managed to

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,240
implement and to address those root

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
causes

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,399
of systemic racism which we see today

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
and i think

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,760
what i find really exciting is that

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,840
right now

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
everyone is talking about it everyone is

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,679
saying we must

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,960
um rise up we must address

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,440
racial injustice we want justice and in

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,440
order to address systemic racism

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,880
um from the un human rights point of

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,039
view is you have to address

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,080
the root causes where does it come from

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,120
and until we are able to have a truthful

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,679
honest conversation about the past

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,880
it's very hard to undo the current

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,840
manifestations

00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:01,200
of racism so at the moment the un

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,240
um has a special team

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,480
looking at how we can address

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,640
these root causes but also how we can

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,000
address the modern manifestations of

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,919
peace violence the impunity for

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,159
for law enforcement violations

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,600
as well as violence against protesters

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
that we're seeing in the us

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,960
but not only you know it's a it's a

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,399
global problem

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,960
um so so these are issues at the moment

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,799
um i think the un is trying to address

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
head-on there was a special urgent

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,799
debate

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,039
at the united nations human rights

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,440
council in june of this year which

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,640
created the team who are preparing a

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,640
report

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,200
on this which will have recommendations

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,159
to try and address the problem

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
excellent excellent i thank you very

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,799
much uh

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,080
uh christina for all the work you're

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,640
doing all the work uh

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,039
u.n human rights is doing i'm gonna

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,320
shift gears a little bit uh stephanie

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,440
i'm just given

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,960
uh christina's um perspective on this

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,399
could you tie

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,799
the stem question uh to you know how do

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,120
we

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,600
hire for uh skill uh versus degree

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
for example how do we provide the

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,159
enabling environment

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,919
for those who are inquisitive who

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,399
want to help they have the talent have a

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,440
passion uh they're looking for that

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,440
platform

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,679
to actually participate and make change

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,600
happen could you tie that to what

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
christina talked about in terms of

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,960
the sort of systemic nature of the

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,760
problem and then

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,559
what we must do going forward in terms

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
of not

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,159
looking for those degrees all the time

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,559
but actually knowing that there is a

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,200
more

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,840
flexible um sort of framework that we

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,840
can work within

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,679
yeah definitely um i think right now

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
it's very interesting because a lot of

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
the skills

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,279
that um arguably you could gain through

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,679
your through pursuing a computer science

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,240
degree for example you could also gain

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,640
um through learning some through the

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,640
technical skills through a course online

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,080
or through an open source for example

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,399
the you know the

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,200
the one that is ibm is doing right now

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,640
right

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,240
lots of different means of gaining the

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,039
same technical skills but we're still

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,360
able to

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,039
attain the same uh skills in order to

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,159
work on issues that we're passionate

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,320
about and

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
i really also resonate with the question

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,799
that you're asking because in high

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
school i

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,640
it was very difficult for me to get

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,600
access to stem

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,720
and stem opportunities and computer

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,399
science and artificial

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,880
intelligence opportunities it was just

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,960
so difficult to attain

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,200
due to the things that going on in my in

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,080
my school and so i had to

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,000
go out of my way and go out of school in

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,600
order to learn these technical skills

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
um so i was learning them through like a

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,919
non-traditional way i would say so i was

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,640
doing summer programs like hope deposit

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,000
for example in the year 2016

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,640
and i did stanford ai for all in 2017

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,720
um and i did other research fellowships

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,960
during high school that were not tied to

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,039
my school so um it was a lot of my

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,720
independent work that i gained that

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,399
that i gained and acquired these skills

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
and i was able to use my technical

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,760
skills in order to work on projects that

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
i was passionate about

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,679
and that you know resonated with me um

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
so it really goes to show that

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,079
um in today's day and age there's so

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,639
much that we are able to do uh there's

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,480
so much

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,960
out there that we can do despite not

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,879
being you know despite not pursuing a

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,240
um you know computer science degree for

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,240
example and i think that's very

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,560
empowering for a lot of individuals

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,320
who don't have the means um you know to

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,440
go to college and to pursue

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,720
these uh lucrative careers um so i think

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,639
that's really empowering for a lot of

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,839
individuals to have programs like black

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
girls who code

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,800
that i think for many girls there it's

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,720
the first time that they're having

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
access to these technical skills

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,320
and for them that's life changing that

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,520
really empowers them to pursue stem and

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,760
higher education

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,839
and i think that's incredibly important

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
um now that we're even moving towards a

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,720
world where everything is so much more

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,800
accessible and i think that's the beauty

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
of the internet it's so accessible

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,079
um you know with the computer and wi-fi

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,400
you can do so much

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,520
and it's so it's so incredibly important

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,560
that you know these

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,440
skills are being accessible to students

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,200
especially in

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,560
elementary school and in middle school

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,599
and high school it's so crazy to think

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,280
about but now

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,599
you know moving forward really need the

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,480
youth to be able to have access to these

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,400
tools

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,599
um that will you know are the 21st

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,560
century skills

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,560
um that we all need

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
that is that is excellent in in the time

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
we have

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,800
left and we don't have plenty of time i

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,400
wanted to get to this

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,640
topic of partnerships partnerships so

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
for the call for code for racial justice

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,599
solutions and we found through the

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,680
dialogue

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,920
that we we have to engage and partner

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,680
with the very organizations that we

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,760
hope to influence and change and reform

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,200
um kristina maybe i start with you and

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,560
then we'll go to anisha

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,240
what are your thoughts about

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,320
partnerships why they're important and

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,440
then how you actually engage

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,320
institutions in a holistic way to drive

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,359
both near-term as well as enduring

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
change over time

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,920
christina

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,920
well um partnerships are crucial

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,880
and and we need to partner with all

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,000
stakeholders

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,720
including um with agencies law

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,240
enforcement agencies with governments

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,560
with uh different national institutions

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,000
civil society and so all stakeholders we

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,320
have to engage

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
and why it's important is if we really

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,359
want to be successful then we need

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
everybody to be on board and to

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,560
understand the importance of it

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,320
we have international human rights law

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,839
there's the international convention for

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,599
the elimination of all forms of racial

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,480
discrimination

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,400
which is international law so therefore

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
it's an obligation for member states to

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,680
take action

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,200
and through the different institutions

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,040
they should be taking action

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,800
so that's something that we work with

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,079
them in terms of raising people's

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
awareness on what

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,000
should be done the action that's

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,400
required and

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,359
providing technical cooperation building

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,320
capacity

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,480
in areas where they perhaps don't have

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
the

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
knowledge or understanding but also at

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,560
the international level there is

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,320
constant reviews

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,800
of the implementation of

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,000
different conventions and treaties and

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,160
there is monitoring

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,680
and human rights monitoring of what's

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,520
happening in different states

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,280
and i would say that there are also you

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,560
know some

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,200
good practices which i think can inspire

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
others

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,800
so we also try to document good

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,920
practices where we find them

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,040
um there are databases on

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,720
legislation policy steps which have been

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,000
taken in the right direction which we

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,480
can point to

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
as um as a way forward and to encourage

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,520
others

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,720
to take action there so i think it is

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,760
critically important

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,720
and as i started talking about these

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,800
reviews

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,720
we have a review of the commitments made

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,599
at the world conference against racism

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,520
there's also an international decade for

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,960
people of african descent which is at

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,839
his midterm review

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,520
which is looking at recognition justice

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,400
and development for people of african

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,839
descent

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,720
and so i think these moments of review

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,280
is a is an opportunity for partnerships

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,160
to be

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,040
strengthened but also for us to to

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,200
really

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,200
look at the successful steps that people

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,680
have taken and to try and encourage

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,839
others to do the same

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,079
that's excellent christina let's go to

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,640
anisha and isha same question

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,560
to you in terms of partnerships um

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,040
partnering with organizations that um

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,359
we hope to reform going forward and then

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,000
the critical partnerships that will be

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,640
needed in order to succeed how do you

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
how do you

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,800
um view this and then how would you

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,280
recommend way approach

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,000
sure so i think one just to speak to

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,680
like why partnerships are necessary um

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
you know with black rose code one of the

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,800
things we feel like that makes us

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,320
stand out compared to other

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
organizations that are doing similar

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
work

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,640
is community right we are very very

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,359
focused on being local

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,960
and um making sure that we are teaching

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
girls to code but they are being led by

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
folks who live near them who are in

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
their

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,000
town um and again building those

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,920
opportunities for

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,680
for for community and i think when it

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
comes to broader partnerships

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,880
community is also important in

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,720
acknowledging what you do well and what

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,200
you don't do in the same way that you

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
build

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,119
um any other team i think partners need

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,119
to figure out what is our strengths our

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,280
strength is connecting with black girls

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,720
right our strength is not around um

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,240
mobile app development or all these

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,760
other things and so we have to figure

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
out where the where's the direction we

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,920
want to take

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,200
the group of girls that we're able to

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,640
work with and who are the partners who

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
can help us execute that

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,880
effectively um so i think partnerships

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,280
are critical when we once we acknowledge

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,480
this is our this is my lane and here's

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,240
here are the other folks who i need to

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,960
help me build this bridge right

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,160
um and so when it comes to critical

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,920
things i think

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,000
uh folks need to do when they are

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,280
building partnerships is i've come to

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
believe that there are four pillars to

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
really

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
enact the change that we're looking for

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,359
one is around exposure

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,119
so in this partnership how's this

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,480
opportunity allowing us to expose more

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,800
people to coding

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,280
um how is this allowing us to broaden

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,440
the pipeline towards the tech industry

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,880
um the second would be around access um

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,079
so how is this partnership house

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,599
collaboration

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
helping us to provide new points of

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,640
entry into our space

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,880
into the tech fields and then

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,880
opportunity once we've identified talent

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,839
or or people who are benefiting and

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,280
structuring

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,319
our organization how are we fostering

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,520
that talent how are we creating

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,800
opportunities for that talent to

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,119
flourish how are we

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
pulling that talent into other projects

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,920
and then the last piece is around

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,319
support how does this partnership

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,440
actually build support for that um you

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,119
know contended

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,800
that particular cohort of talented

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,079
individuals are we making sure that they

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,359
stay within the industry are we making

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,880
sure that they have

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,400
uh the resources they need to bring

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
other people into the industry so i

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,440
think if we

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,200
um to the point that i think was said

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,720
before if we are being intentional about

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,040
how we structure our partnerships and we

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,640
are examining why this partnership

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,920
exists and what we want from it

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,240
and you know running it through that

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,760
lens of excess of exposure access

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,839
opportunity and support

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
that we can begin to build like i said

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,079
those long-term relationships

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,319
that will enable us to really change the

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,680
industry make it more diverse and make

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,359
it a space that people

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,280
of diverse backgrounds want to feel

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,720
comfortable in and want to lead and want

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,520
to stay in so that's my

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,359
my two cents thank you very much anisha

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,160
and justin

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,920
we are running short on time here but on

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,800
this question of partnership i think

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,200
it's critically

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,839
important um as anisha stated to have

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,839
intentionality

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,359
around what partnership looks like and

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,160
then what success

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,119
actually looks like in in a sustained

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,599
fashion

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,200
um justin what are your thoughts on this

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,760
uh the work you're leading uh

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,440
seems like a fantastic example to speak

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,680
about partnerships uh

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,760
any thoughts on how this might uh be

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,480
considered or regarded

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,920
yeah um i i love to use the example of

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,319
of collab capital

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,839
um even though it's a it's a a tool to

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,160
be used as an investment

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,640
it's it actually goes well beyond just

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,079
financial capital uh what we decided to

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,000
do very early on was

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,520
was take a look at the existing systems

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,720
which i think we all would agree

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,040
something we have to do

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,400
and figure out how to dismantle it if it

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,240
needs dismantling

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,520
it's not about painting it over we

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,040
sometimes you have to actually

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,720
break things apart and get down to the

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,079
root cause and so that's what we did

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,440
with the capital markets we

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,800
looked at all the instruments that were

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,200
out there the different tools that were

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,920
used

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,960
to invest in innovations and small

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
businesses and

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,800
high you know high growth value based

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,040
tech startups and we decided to build

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,280
something new based off of what we saw

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,560
and what we realized in along with some

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,160
additional data which is where

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,800
partnerships come into play

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,480
uh with the kaufman foundation um and

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
some others that are that have been

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,200
looking at this

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,680
looking at the data points for quite

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,160
some time the k-port center

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,760
we we realize that there's this massive

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,640
opportunity right so there's a

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
there's an inherent business opportunity

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,920
um

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,119
for 83 percent of businesses that don't

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,880
fall into

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,480
one of the traditional financial

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,599
capitalization models which is venture

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,440
capital and banking

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,520
and so what we decided to do was build

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,040
something new and then we also

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,880
realized that we needed to bring the

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,000
very companies and the people that

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,760
worked in these uh

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
working these uh these businesses we

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,640
need to bring them to the table

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,720
to make sure that there was access and

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,200
opportunity on the business development

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,640
side

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,560
for companies particularly those that

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,119
are high growth mid to high growth

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,200
so it's more than just uh financial

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,400
capital it is activating and unlocking

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,359
the social capital

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,119
which is even more important than um or

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,480
equally as important as we when we look

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,319
at financial capitalists

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,079
you can you can build a team a very

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,480
talented team with hundreds and hundreds

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,920
of

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,079
talented folks but if they don't have

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,480
opportunities to business development

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,920
sales and growth um then those

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,599
businesses become stagnant and they

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,920
and they suffer and some and sometimes

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,440
die so it is incredibly important that

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,440
we think about partnership we think

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,839
about it in a comprehensive way

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,680
and look further than the surface and

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,520
really really um to the points made

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,960
by the panel earlier is really attack

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,000
the issues at the core

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
and really build from there this is

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,760
