Abstract: Great technology starts with great code—and achieving great code starts with every individual having a seat at the table. It’s the diversity of perspective, expertise, and experience working in concert that makes transformative innovations come to life. Creating an inclusive environment for diverse communities is the key to pushing technology forward—and there’s work to be done. We only have 24% of computing jobs with women, and almost 70% of the coding community is traditionally white. With the help of technology, coders can build diversity and equality in their profession—and uplift underrepresented communities in this space. The time is now to foster a diverse community of coders that can push technology to new heights.

Join Ndu Emuchay, IBM Fellow, IBM Services Cloud Transformation and members of many other organizations focused on underrepresented communities as they discuss the role technology can play to help aid and accelerate racial justice. They will also address the importance of diversity in STEM to advance innovation and equality. Ndu will also share exciting news about diverse and new open source communities and how you – developers, organizations, and concerned global citizens – can get involved now to be part of tangible change that we want to see today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.
