thank you to

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,759
all of our attendees joining us today um

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,799
like brian said my name is remy the

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
causemaker

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,320
my preferred pronouns are he him

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,240

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
and you can email me at remy to

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,279
causemaker.org

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
these slides as humble as they are are

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,800
available

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
on my github so github.com to cause

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
slash

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,079
dex slash ato dash to cause

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,280
2020 and today's talk

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,079
is titled cultures of contribution

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,879
how contributions flow and what it means

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,000
to be a contributor

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,960
and because this is all things open i

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
wanted to

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,879
send a special thank you and a shout out

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,079
to todd and danny

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,520
and all the other tireless organizers

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,799
and volunteers who've been working on

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
this becoming the largest east coast

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
open source conference in the united

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
states

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
i've had the privilege of being invited

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,880
and accepted to speak at ato

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,680
oh geez for at least seven or eight

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,520
years now

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,040
so i really wanted to take a moment to

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
recognize that this

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
is something like any other open source

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
project that grows

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079
and becomes what it is because of the

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
participation of

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
people like you the folks on the stream

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,920
the folks like brian

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
and the folks who make this what it is

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
so i just wanted to recognize that

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,360
effort

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,520
and say super shout out super thank you

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,479
thank you for having me again really

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,520
appreciate the opportunity

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,920
so cultures of contribution let's talk

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
about it

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,799
there are two elements to this talk

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,520
at least to the title the first one is

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,920
contribution flows and the second one is

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,719
what does it mean to be a contributor

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,959
so before we can talk about what it

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,160
means to contribute let's talk about

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
what a contribution is

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,480
so in this little

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
folk realm of describing open source in

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,920
a descriptive way

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
using clever analogies and metaphors

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
i'll be using a bunch

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,000
stuff that i don't make up myself i try

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,000
to provide references for

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
but some of this stuff is made up and

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
based on

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
things that have been published by other

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,519
folks

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,360
other places you can read about it we

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
all stand on the shoulders of giants

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
and open source isn't just one community

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
it's a community

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,160
of communities so anybody who tells you

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,599
this is the one and only way to describe

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,040
contributions or contributors uh

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,280
probably not being

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
honest with themselves or with you about

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
sort of

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,000
the plethora of viewpoints and

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
approaches to doing open source

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
contribution and work

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,760
and working together so this is sort of

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,840
caveat remy's version

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,879
so in remy's version uh contribution

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,599
has a few elements the first thing

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
is that it's voluntary the second thing

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
is that it was contributed for a purpose

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
the third thing is that it solves an

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
existing actual problem

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
and the fourth thing is sort of a bonus

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
it's just ideally it doesn't waste

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,440
time or resources so

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,799
with voluntary that means self-selection

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,120
and in the realm of open source

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,440
there is this idea that the best

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
motivators that you can have to do

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,519
difficult work

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,040
especially when you don't exactly know

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
what the nature of that work is going to

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
be

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
is self-selection you are going to be

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,400
most excited about diving into

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
projects that you care about you're

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
going to be most motivated to

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
figure out the hard problems if there

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,120
are problems that you're genuinely

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
interested in

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,239
so whether a contribution is coming from

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
a person who has a full-time job who's

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
paid to do this

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,680
or a random person who's just doing this

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,359
as a hobby on the side

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,919
they're still choosing they are still

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,240
volunteering to make this contribution

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,919
so that is a really key important

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
differentiator in the world of open

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,040
source

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,560
and that idea of choice versus force

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,919
so i'm still choosing to make this

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
contribution i'm still

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,840
using the tool that is available or i'm

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
still contributing to the tool that's

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,080
available

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,320
because there are alternatives there are

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,800
things that you could be using otherwise

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,720
and the fact that you are using this one

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,759
even if it's free

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
even if you're not forced to do it that

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
is

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
that element of self selection once

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,400
again

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
the second element is that it's for a

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
purpose

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
a lot of times it starts with scratching

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,960
your own itch

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
as it's called in open source the idea

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
that you solve your own problem for

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
yourself

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
and then if it solves somebody else's

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
problem too cool great

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
and if we work on it together then maybe

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,919
even we can prevent

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,080
future itches from coming up right

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
whether you're doing that as work for

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,639
hire

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
somebody has hired you to work full-time

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
on an open source project

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,520
as a gainfully employed person or

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
whether you're

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,440
on your path to getting involved in open

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
source and primarily

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
you're contributing with a passion for

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
learning or exploring

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,199
or being a user either way

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
contributions come with a purpose i

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,479
think that there's

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
a lot of folks who sort of assume that

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,759
like if you build it they will come and

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
contributions just materialize out of

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,199
thin air and that people contribute for

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,479
no reason in particular at all there's

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
just all these people waiting on the

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,479
internet

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,880
to help you do your project and

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,080
though that is uh maybe the case in some

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,880
fields or domains

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,759
it is often not the prevailing

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
atmosphere

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
so i think it's important to point out

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,520
that contributions

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,759
oftentimes come with a specific purpose

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,240
in mind

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,440
and the implicit purpose of the

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
contribution

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,960
whether you're solving a particular

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,960
problem or not

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
is that you don't want to waste your

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,880
time or resources

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,560
communities like many other systems

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,759
have finite energy and if a contribution

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
doesn't persist

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
or it cannot land then that energy will

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,919
find another path

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,039
uh this idea sort of tags along with the

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,160
law of conservation of effort is what

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,400
we're going to call it today

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
as opposed to energy so wait a minute

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
isn't law of conservation of energy like

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
a physics thing

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
yes it is and energy can be thought of

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
as just

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
or effort can be thought of as energy

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
over time

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,720
and describing effort takes both

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,039
an artistic creative mind to describe

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
these

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
abstract and metaphorical analogies but

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
there's also some science

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
that prevails and some governing

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
principles

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
that guide the types of effort and where

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,759
it goes

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,560
and how quickly and when and how so

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,400
we're going to talk about a couple today

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,599
there are definitely more than a couple

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,479
but there are two that i want to

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,199
highlight particularly in this talk

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,280
the first is the principle of least

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,560
action

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,639
this is colloquially understood

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
in hacker and contributor communities in

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,039
open source

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,280
in the expression lazy like a fox

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,120
that is people don't want to do more

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
work than they have to

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
and they don't want to spend more time

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
than they have to so

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
the principle of lease action in open

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
source can sort of be described as

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
the thing that will take the least

00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
amount of effort in the least amount of

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
time

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,639
that gives me the best quality and

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,240
exposing me to the least amount of risk

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,000
this idea of the principal lease action

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
was sort of how i got started on this

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
whole talk

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
it turns out that there are a lot of

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,360
really brilliant

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
mathematicians scientists in a variety

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
of fields

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,879
who have come to this idea of the path

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,039
of least resistance or the principle of

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,720
least effort

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,400
these concepts apply beyond just the

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,719
little talk i'm giving today

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
a principle of least action can be used

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,800
to describe

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
why heat goes from hot to cold in

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,080
thermodynamics

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,080
it can be used to describe why electrons

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
will take a particular path on a circuit

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
board

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
in electrical engineering it can be used

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,080
to describe

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,040
why animals choose the

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
lowest point on a map or the least

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,560
difficult path

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
to traverse through a forest whether

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,760
it's physics

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,839
or biology astronomy astrophysics

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
the principle of least action continues

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,560
to show up across a number of

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,600
disciplines

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,640
so i figured i would abuse my

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,240
right here to present about it and apply

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,120
it to open source because

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,720
i believe that humans also know this

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
innately along with animals

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,560
and it's the physics of effort that

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,040
really drives how people do this work

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
so the principle of leaks action lazy

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,839
like a fox

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
this is a key piece that we'll talk more

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,720
about in a minute

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,519
so as i said it's an art and a science

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,640
uh let's start with some really bad art

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,800
this is a picture

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,680
let me set the stage for you imagine

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,040
you're a villager on one side of a river

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
imagine there's a village

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,959
on the other side of the river where you

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,160
can trade each day

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,360
you get one block to use villagers are

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
lazy i mean

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
wise and prefer to take the shortest

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,560
path aka

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,480
the principle of least action so

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
if you can get villagers on each side to

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
agree to put their blocks

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,959
next to each other you can build

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
stepping stones

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
and you can get across but what if you

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,680
don't

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
know where they're going to put their

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,040
blocks

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
if you put yours where you want and they

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
put theirs where they want it turns out

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
that you can't actually cross the river

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,800
so ideally you want to be in alignment

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
you want your blocks to be aligned with

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
the blocks

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,680
of the other people across because you

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,440
both have only one block a day to use

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,000
and you only have one day to spend so

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,440
ideally you want the conditions to line

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
up and you want your work to build off

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
each other so that you both can mutually

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
benefit

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
it's a very simple little simulation we

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
have here

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,519
the problem with rivers though is that

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
they don't stand still

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,440
rivers are constantly moving and in the

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
physical world

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
it's kind of difficult and we have

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,959
limitations of physics

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,200
but in the world of software what if

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,079
we could actually change how the river

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,880
flowed

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,600
so that the boxes would stay where they

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,519
were put or that the natural forces

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
would tend towards keeping things in

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
order rather than

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
them separating and coming out of

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,200
alignment

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,480
this is a fun little thought experiment

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
and we're going to continue building on

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,000
this story

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,800
as we go forward in the talk so

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
let's say that we're on that same river

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,959
and here's our representation

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,200
on one side we've got the block provider

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,959
and on the other side we have the block

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
seller or buyer

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,200
and if you're on one side and you want

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
to get across

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
you want to take the least amount of

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
time to take your block

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
and sell it so which way are you going

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,639
to go

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,760
are you gonna go on path one

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,120
or path two well if you didn't know

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,480
better and you were not sure

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,680
you might end up taking path two

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,200
but you might see and observe from the

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,839
community around you

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
that somebody else took path one and

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
because they took path one

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,120
it's really apparent that it takes a lot

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
less time to walk your block from

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
your side of the river across and then

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,639
to the place where you can sell it and

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,760
trade it for other things

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,160
so now knowing that

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,079
you say wait a minute if we both don't

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,760
know where our blocks are going to go

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
and we can go in either the first column

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
or the second column what are we going

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,440
to choose

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,120
though the path of least action or the

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
principle of least action

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,959
would tell us that hey actually it takes

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
a lot less time if we start with the

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,160
path that's closest to the place

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
upstream so there's a good chance that

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
even though

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,160
these two villagers don't know where

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,079
they're going to go and they don't

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,920
necessarily speak the same language

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
they do know that it takes longer to

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,160
walk farther so

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
it's an obvious decision that if both of

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
you can put your blocks as close to the

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
both as possible

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,000
you should that's the physics of it

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,480
pretty simple so

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
with that in mind and with that example

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,160
let's talk a little bit about

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
what it means to be a contributor and

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,920
there are some other principles that

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,440
we're going to talk about today

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,839
so another phenomena that is sort of

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
emergent in the world of not just open

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,800
source but

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
lots of other places too is called the

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,880
pareto principle

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,279
informally known as the 80 20 rule

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,600
it can be described as roughly 80 of

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,199
consequences are derived from 20 percent

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
of causes

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,959
in a software centric description of the

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,040
world this might

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,720
manifest as eighty percent of the code

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
only takes about twenty percent of your

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,760
time to build

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
but the hardest twenty percent of the

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
code takes the other eighty percent of

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,040
the time

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
another way of describing this 80 20

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,360
split could be that

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,199
80 percent of contributions come from 20

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,839
of contributors

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
there are many other examples of the

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
pareto principle in action

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,920
and it can be described used to describe

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,959
behavior in lots of places not just

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,560
software but

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,160
we're going to stick to the software and

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,839
open source specific because

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
we're at all things open today but i

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,560
would highly recommend checking out the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
wikipedia article

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
on the pareto principle and finding out

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,079
about the history and all the different

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,440
places that it applies

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,079
so in the world of open source that 20

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
percent

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,639
core well how do you find them if that's

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
the important part of being a

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,079
contributor

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,560
and you know that 80 percent of the work

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,800
is going to be done by that core people

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,320
how do you find them it's like the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
village on the other side of the river

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,920
where you may not know where they're

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
going to go and you may not even speak

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,800
the same language

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,199
but we still want to connect so

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,440
there are a couple of things you can do

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,519
to find them

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,560
friction ambiguity and uncertainty

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,600
these are three barriers to

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,279
taking the path of least action

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,440
so if you want to improve the likelihood

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,880
that someone's going to take the path

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,199
you can start by reducing friction

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,160
when we think of friction we can do

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,000
another cute little stick figure analogy

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,800
think of a contribution as a big old

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,959
boulder and you're a contributor

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
and the friction for getting that

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,199
contribution

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,199
upstream or added to a project is like

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,320
how much effort it takes to move the

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,120
boulder from one place to another

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
let's say that in ideal circumstances if

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,959
there's no

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
blockers and the path is certain and

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,040
there's no ambiguity

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,519
then it's probably like a 2 out of 10

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
effort

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,800
to get you there and you can think of

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,959
all the steps that you take along the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,800
way to get your contribution

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,839
into the project like a path

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,360
and it might start off being easy but

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,800
maybe there's some barriers

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,680
in the middle where you have to go

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,920
uphill and the effort becomes harder

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,279
but once you get it up the hill there

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,480
might be infrastructure

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,320
or processes in place that make it

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,160
easier once the project gets through

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,920
that barrier of entry

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,279
so you have reducing

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,079
friction as a way to make it more likely

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,800
that contributions will come to you

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,040
and if these contributions are the kinds

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
of things that we want to build upon

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,480
it would be nice if they were

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,360
generalized

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,639
if roughly all of the contributions were

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,560
of the same size

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
if they covered roughly the same amount

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
of complexity and

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,320
if they were contributed by a broad

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,880
array of people so that any one person

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,120
not being around in the project aka the

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,759
bus factor

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
or the boss factor or whatever you want

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
to call it these days check out

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,720
chaos.community for the latest jargon

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,839
whatever the case may be you want to

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,520
ideally see your contributions be

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,880
relatively uniform relatively

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,199
reproducible and come in in the same way

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,839
in reality this isn't how projects are

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,760
built they usually look more like this

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,880
where we have the

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,120
majority contributor maybe a large

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,559
contribution coming from a core team

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
and then the smaller contributions that

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,240
sort of

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,720
frame it and are around it and these

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,880
all sort of depend on each other and

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
when you get into a really big community

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
uh you might see a plethora of different

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
kinds of project contributions coming in

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,840
there might be

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
core contributors with the massive core

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,720
there might be some plug-ins on the side

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
where people are adding contributions of

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
their own

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
size and complexity covering different

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,440
kinds of

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,880
things that may not be part of the core

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,039
and then maybe a few missing links

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
where people have a particular bug or a

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,840
hole that

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
they needed to solve for themselves and

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
why not we can just contribute it back

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
up so you can see in this little diagram

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
here

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,720
you know this represents sort of a

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,160
heterogeneous

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,480
mix of core contributors and

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
community members and some drive-by

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,039
patches

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,080
sort of all jumbled together into one

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,919
relatively undifferentiated bridge

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
if you will that you can use to cross

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,160
the chasm

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,760
so if that is about friction

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,440
then let's talk about ambiguity

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,960
and uncertainty so another helpful

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,840
metaphor

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,840
that i use for describing sort of how

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,160
how software works together in stacks

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,400
i imagine a stack of disks

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,960
and those disks each have a bit of a

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,320
keyhole in them and

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
each one of them is their own project

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,360
and as long as all the dependencies are

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
aligned

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,679
then the work you need to do the path to

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
least resistance to solve

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
to meet your purpose can go through this

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
stack

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
and when i'm thinking about how teams of

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,880
people depend on each other both inside

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,559
of a company

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
and outside of a company or across

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,160
communities i imagine sort of exploding

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,039
out this graph

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,760
and each one of these disks might be

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,320
rotating

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,200
at a slightly different pace or each one

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,440
might have

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
slightly more tolerance for how big the

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,600
hole is the keyhole through which you

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,960
can find the path of least resistance

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,480
but this is the analogy that i imagine

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,240
when i'm thinking about

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,240
how to get people aligned if you are

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
hard depending on something else below

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,200
you

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,280
and that version is there then you can

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
assume that the next version on top of

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,159
it is going to work

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
if somebody else across the river is

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,240
using the same path as you

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,960
and as long as you keep your stuff in

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
alignment

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,880
with the other stuff that's happening

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
then the path of least resistance can

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,760
remain so

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,720
by removing ambiguity and creating

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
alignment

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,120
that's how i think about how this stuff

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
goes through

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,520
so the other

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
element that i want to talk about isn't

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
that you know

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
work isn't usually undifferentiated uh

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,799
you can build a bridge across a river

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,720
by just throwing different sizes of

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
stones in there in a pile and hoping

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,919
that they

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,440
work but like we said there's only so

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,240
many stones or blocks that we can have

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
in a day

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,960
there's only so much time that can be

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,320
done and software isn't undifferentiated

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,440
it doesn't have a non-dependency

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,679
relationship

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
you can imagine it more kind of like a

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
masonry arch

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
where each element depends on the

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
element next to it

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,679
and there's an order to it and each of

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,720
the components relies on each other

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,240
and those contributions can be done in a

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
particular order and if they are

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,480
accomplished then

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,679
it creates a system where there is

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,000
mutually assured

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
progress where you're building on the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,360
progress of others

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,080
and it can be more advanced it can be

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
very granular or it can be more general

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,039
here is a really nice diagram that i

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,679
stole from wikipedia

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,200
at the link below and then artist's

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,320
approximation of what a more rough

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,039
system would look like

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,600
but the principle is the same if you had

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,320
to stand up this type of a bridge

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,159
you couldn't do it just by throwing the

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,000
rocks into the water randomly

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
you'd have to actually stand each one up

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
individually and support them

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,240
until you could get to the middle to

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,480
meet in a keystone type situation

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,799
and by having this type of alignment

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,120
that's implicit in the structure

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,919
you can get people to understand exactly

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,200
what the next step

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,240
is even without telling them that by

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
creating a structural expectation around

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
your project in the code

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,840
you can actually align people's purposes

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,799
just by what kind of blocks you're using

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,799
how big they are

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,559
how hard they are to move how many you

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,400
can send at a time

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,600
all these different constraints about

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,159
the material

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
materiality of the contributions

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,240
actually dictates the physics

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,080
of things which is exciting because in

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,120
software we can break the rules a little

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,480
bit

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,720
so let's go back to our two sides of the

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,960
river

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
let's make the constraints a little bit

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,159
higher let's say that it's not just a

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,919
little river that you can wade across

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,120
but it's like a big old cliff

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,679
and there's a chasm between you it'd be

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
nice

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,039
if you could just say yeah we need a

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,000
bridge it's a block

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,679
it spans the entire way and we both

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,480
agree that it needs to look like this

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,360
and it should be awesome the problem is

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
is that uh

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,640
things are rarely built that way

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
especially bridges if there was

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
something that was just long enough to

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,440
cross the span

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
then you would just use it but bridges

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
have to be built

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
out of components so let's say that each

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,880
side

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,039
builds about half of it and you know

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
that if i go halfway and you go halfway

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,520
we should get across

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,679
right the problem is is that um

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
without anything in the middle a sort of

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,280
central point to build towards

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,360
you won't know if those are going to

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
meet up or you won't know

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,280
if you're going to put them out at the

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,120
right time there needs to be some kind

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,880
of mutually understood

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,320
rally point enter open standards

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,919
enter open source enter dependencies

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
there are a lot of different ways that

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,080
this pattern comes to be

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,039
but if you can expect that this one

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
piece in the middle

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,159
is going to be there and it's going to

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,480
stay and that is shaped in a certain way

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,880
then you and each side can come up with

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,279
the pieces that will fit in between

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,480
and understanding the utility of the

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,880
work that you're doing

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
and how it serves your purpose and

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
relying on the other

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,400
side's purpose to be maintained through

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,320
the utility to do what they need to do

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
you can actually get where you want to

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,480
go

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,039
so these are fun analogies and they're

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,039
cute to talk about

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,400
but let's boil it down a little bit

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
culture of contribution has a few things

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
in it that

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,440
help to enable people to be aligned to

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,240
reduce friction reduce ambiguity and

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,720
reduce uncertainty

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,799
one is planning in the open the more

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,760
transparent you are about what you're

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000
going to do

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
the more clear it is where the other

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,320
side should be putting their blocks

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
right if you say i'm going to put my

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,760
block

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,679
as close to the other side as possible

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,520
tomorrow

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,120
and the other side knows it they're

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
pretty likely to put their block

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
as close to yours as well to reduce the

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
amount of time that both of you need to

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,400
spend

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,279
and the amount of energy and effort that

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,960
goes into moving the blocks

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,640
adhering to open standards is like

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
putting that pylon in the center

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
where if both of you can rely on a

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,520
common architecture or a common

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,760
implementation path

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,360
then your pieces are more likely to fit

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,760
and more likely to stay when you put

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,760
them down

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,799
by using release engineering best

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,799
practices

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,880
how you ship your blocks and how often

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,080
they move by being clear about those

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
expectations

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
you actually make it easier for folks to

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
come in and out of your project

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,279
whether that's continuous integration

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
and testing whether it's

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,880
revision control whether it's open

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
communication channels

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,640
whether it's semantic versioning so that

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
your releases are clear when they're

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
shipped whether or not they're backwards

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,039
compatible or not

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,279
all these different best practices help

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,360
to reduce ambiguity and align

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,120
the different sides of the contribution

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,320
river

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,679
by doing it so that both of you are

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,799
using the same bridge you are aligning

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,400
and mutually assuring your progress this

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,320
makes it really fun to work together

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,600
because the more blocks you build

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,720
uh the more utility you get from the

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,520
structures that are made out of the

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,559
blocks

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,640
and this aligns your purpose the idea of

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,240
becoming the path of least resistance

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,760
is how you create a culture of

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,559
contribution

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,760
you can try to convince people you can

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,080
try to trick people

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,279
into doing things but really the physics

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,159
of this thing

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,520
helps to determine whether or not which

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
path is the obvious one

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,440
on the flip side sort of in the bizarro

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,000
world we can talk about

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,120
a culture of capture and i don't want to

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
talk too much smack

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
about the culture of capture because

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,640
really on its face

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,120
a culture of capture and a culture of

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,360
contribution are both doing their best

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,840
to minimize friction to minimize

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,200
uncertainty and to minimize ambiguity

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,200
these have slightly different ways of

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,320
going about it

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,919
so information asymmetry is a big part

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,200
of a culture of capture

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,760
the idea that it's the sort of bizarro

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,600
version

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,360
of planning and communicating

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,760
transparently

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,559
if people don't know where the work is

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,440
going

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,880
then they might make decisions with

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,039
imperfect information

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
and when they have imperfect information

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,279
there are margins

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,080
and margins can be exploited so

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,200
information asymmetry is a big part of

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,279
helping to reduce

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
uncertainty if you don't know there are

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,720
options then you're only going to pick

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,720
the ones you know about

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
vendor and proprietary lock-in are

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,520
another common

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,080
tactic in a culture of capture where

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,679
if i have my standard but it is a very

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,360
special shaped standard

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,200
and your blocks only fit

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,799
if you get them from the same place that

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,120
i get them from

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,880
then that ensures that there's less

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,679
uncertainty to the mix there's

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
less heterogeneity amongst the

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,000
contributions

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,679
this can be a positive and i can

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,120
understand why

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:17,279
control is one of the things that

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,679
is used in keeping things the same

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,399
so bottlenecks and gatekeeping are

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,399
another tactic

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,200
by controlling who can contribute and

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,279
how often

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,440
you can actually do a lot of

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,559
directing of where the energy goes and

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,440
how the effort is used

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,679
as we talked about before in a in a

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,279
culture of contribution

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,559
you want your work to be utilized and

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,600
you don't want it to be

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,880
foregone or replaced or disappeared

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,840
and that understanding of mutually

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,559
assured

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,559
progress excuse me

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,840
uh that keeps people on the same path

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,080
and an alignment

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,600
but another way to align people is by

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,360
putting an expiration date on those

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,080
contributions and saying

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
you know when they're all over with uh

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,000
you're going to be

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,520
you know this isn't going to last

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,039
forever it's only going to last for a

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,640
while and we're going to have to come up

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,640
with the next thing

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,919
when people don't assume that things

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
will be there forever

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,480
then they contribute differently and

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,880
they use their effort in different ways

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,320
so manufactured obsolescence keeps

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,159
people coming back to your

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
place where they're getting the blocks

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,840
but it also you know reduces

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,480
ambiguity and creates an alignment of

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,000
itself

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,360
and along with the analogy of the path

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
of least resistance

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,480
you can also create a path of most

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,200
resistance if

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,440
the alternatives have more friction and

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,640
more ambiguity and more uncertainty

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,840
then it turns out that maybe the path of

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
least resistance

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,559
isn't the naturally least resistant one

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
or the one of the least resistance of

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,279
all but it's the one that's the least

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,799
resistant that you know of

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,440
so you still might end up taking that

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,480
path too

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,640
so culture of contribution

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,919
culture of capture both trying to do

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,840
basically the same thing

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,360
just slightly different results or

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,960
slightly different tactics for how they

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,559
do it

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,279
so the nice thing about this simulation

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,520
that we had

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,440
is that it's very neat and it has a

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,039
certain physics that bounds it

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,880
the direction of the river probably

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,919
won't change the direction of gravity

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,840
doesn't change

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,679
location of the villages won't change

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,480
location of the villages relative to

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
each other

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,320
or relative to the river the population

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
won't change that much

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,080
the rules of using roads won't change

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,679
you know all these different things are

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,880
nice and neat and tidy

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,520
but in the world of software the physics

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,039
aren't just about scarcity it's not just

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,120
a zero-sum game it's

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,320
a little bit different than the

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,799
obviousness of

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,039
where we can walk in this world uh

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,960
when we align things like let's say that

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,640
if you could get people to agree

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
to put three of their blocks next to

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,440
each other it would create a road

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
and a road could put a wagon on it and

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,720
the wagon

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,240
can carry way more blocks than you could

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,360
carry by hand

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,320
so by aligning incentives

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,679
and increasing the marginal utility of

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,840
working together

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,000
you actually create a culture of

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,360
contribution

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
mutually assured progress

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,679
but if the rules could change and they

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,399
were different

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,200
let's say that there was

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
a man in a hat and that man in a hat had

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,039
a cane

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,919
and with that cane he could create

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
portals

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
and wormholes into different pieces and

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,919
parts

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,799
of the world you're in and what if those

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
portals could

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,279
transport between different parts all of

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,159
a sudden the path of least resistance

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,159
isn't physically obvious it's not just a

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,480
matter of whether or not your block is

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,519
closest to the vendor station

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,840
now with this new physics

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,679
you can actually create special links

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,640
between different parts of the world

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,360
so the physics of doing software and

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,159
linking

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,000
and are not just the same as throwing

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
blocks into a river

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,120
if the physics were different if the

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,399
river could flow in any direction if

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,320
gravity could change

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,640
what if instead of it being one side of

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,799
a river the topology was different

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
what if it was a series of islands in an

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,519
archipelago

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,960
and it wasn't just about getting across

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
one side of the river to the other

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
but across a system of islands and if

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,360
each of them could have their own

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,200
replacements and dependencies and there

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
could be shortcuts

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,880
all of this would drastically change the

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,240
path of least resistance in the path of

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,799
lease action

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
so in imperfect systems when there are

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,240
shortcuts

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,080
we actually see the potential for

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
ambiguity and uncertainty to creep back

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
in

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,200
as opposed to ones that have the

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,200
physical bounding so

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,480
rather than continue going on in this

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
thought experiment

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,720
i wanted to leave it there i would

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,240
really like to continue building out

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,720
these little

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,799
simulations and physics drawings and

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,360
helping to

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,000
speak more to what it means to be a

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,960
contributor

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,080
and why people work together i think

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
that the physics

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,000
of path of least resistance make a lot

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,600
of sense but they aren't the only thing

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,840
and it's where there's actually more

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,519
uncertainty ambiguity where i'm

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,200
interested in hearing about

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
sort of how people navigate those

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,399
systems and coming up with new analogies

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,360
to describe that too

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,360
so i think at this point it's a good

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,840
idea for me to cut it off

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,440
and to open it up for questions because

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,279
this has been a fun little romp

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,799
through the abstract and i want to hear

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,799
what folks have to have to say

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,679
outstanding rummy that was great um i

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,720
love i love the examples and

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,200
and analogies that you uh you shared

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,040
that's

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,720
i never i've never thought about it that

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,159
way but it does really

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,200
make sense i mean with open source it um

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,399
that's really great um

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,919
i don't i don't see any questions but

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,760
i i was thinking of one though

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:31,520
what do you say about hackers

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,800
and potential bad agents out there with

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,520
open source do you do you see it as

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,520
you know the open source community being

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,919
when someone knows the i guess the the

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,760
rule book or they

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,599
they've got the blueprint you know does

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,320
it make it easier or do you think that

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,520
there's enough

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,599
good agents out there that you know to

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,079
to thwart those threats or those types

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,119
of what

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,760
what are you yeah yeah this is a great

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,960
question

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,920
um the the cute

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,760
principle or the tied up nicely analogy

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,480
is security through obscurity

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,920
right so uh it's sort of the throw a

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,200
blanket on it version

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,800
of uh security where you say if i don't

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
look at it and i don't tell anyone

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
there's a problem

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,880
then maybe nobody will find out that

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,400
it's there

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,599
and that's a nice thought but it didn't

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,880
work

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,240
in the death star and it does not work

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
it helms deep

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,359
and it doesn't work in open source

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,240
either um

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,920
someone will find that path uh with

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,599
transparency of the code

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,680
it's clear where the river is and where

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,920
the shortest paths are across it

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,200
the idea that you can pretend that

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,680
they're not there

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
that's one way of going about it or you

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,400
can be

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,000
thorough and you can say well we know

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,359
that here's the path of least resistance

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,880
the drain that goes under the bridge

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,640
where you can put the thing and make a

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,320
lot of problems for you know legolas and

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,119
gimli and everybody in helms deep right

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,880
so

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,240
if we know that that's there then why

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,480
don't we identify it

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,720
and then drive contributions towards

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,760
solving this problem and recognizing it

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
so there will always be a sort of snakes

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,160
and ladders

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,000
type dynamic with cops and robbers or

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
bad guys and good guys or whatever you

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,119
want to call it right

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,800
there will always be an adversary and a

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,920
defender and

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,560
the cycle that you go through to meet

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,800
each other

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,640
is actually more important than whether

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,640
or not you get into the cycle at all

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,079
you're going to be in the cycle so your

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,359
ability to quickly

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,760
cycle through the attackers

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,520
capabilities and solve them and work

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
together and align your community to do

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,480
it

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,079
is more likely to solve the problem than

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,599
pretending that it's not there hoping

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,040
that nobody finds out

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,720
and it's kind of a bummer because it

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,400
means you're going to be like sisyphus

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
like constantly pushing a boulder up and

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,760
down a hill but

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,839
that's why this grand unified theory of

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,079
conservation of effort is so important

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,160
because if people understood that we

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,800
already have a sprawling vast

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,200
network of software dependencies that is

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
not

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,440
really maintainable then why should we

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
be adding more attack surface to that

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,560
shouldn't we be

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,400
focusing on the dependencies that

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,320
everyone needs to work on

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
to have a common ground the stack so

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
that it's aligned so that we can secure

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
that thing

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,079
right um there's another one it's uh

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
the the bigger your your horde the more

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,200
likely you're gonna see dragons right

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
so when you create these like

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,000
concentrated centrality

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,599
networks of value that actually creates

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,880
a path of least resistance to getting

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,760
the most utility by

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,960
doing nefarious things right so by

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
structuring your

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,400
communities in federated ways or under

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
zero trust or

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,920
there are a lot of different analogies

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,359
or devices and

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,520
open source that like pgp or

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,599
you know without going into all of them

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,079
here um there are ways that you can

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,119
attempt to navigate uncertainty and

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,240
ambiguity

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,560
while aligning things but uh to be

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,240
to be in tech is to always have work to

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,839
do to be an open source means to admit

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
that software is never done and the work

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,760
is never done

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,119
so hopefully by working together and

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,160
aligning with your community

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,400
you're going to be more likely to

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:19,839
address the stuff that people need and

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:21,920
plug those holes before they get found

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,920
