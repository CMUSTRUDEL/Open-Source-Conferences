	Presented by: Keith Bergelt, Open Invention Network (OIN)
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - 101 Track

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) is creating a new global dynamic. Virtually every electronic touch point in our daily lives is now powered by Open Source technologies. Consider smart cars, ATMs, stock exchanges, cloud services, Android phones, social media, and many others,

Unarguably, Open Source is changing the way we invent. As part of this trend, software development is increasingly through OSS projects. Businesses of all sizes are embracing collaborative and global development models through OSS projects. The result is higher levels of innovation happens more efficiently, comes from the collective intelligence of the best talent in the world, and new technologies go to market faster. However, projects must ensure that technical development and collaboration occurs along with legal cooperation between participants, so that this growth and continued innovation is not slowed by patent risks.

This presentation will discuss these factors, as well as the leading community-based non-aggression initiatives to protect OSS code and reduce patent risk. Keith will also share insights about the evolution of Open Invention Network since it was founded in 2005, the importance of the Linux System, and the scope and global impact of OINâ€™s patent cross-licensing community.

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
very much

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,960
and uh thank you for the opportunity to

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
uh

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,320
to be at the event that was just as

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,799
while we were

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,560
getting ready i was talking about the

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,359
first event i i went to

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,359
for all things open was a an earlier

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
kind of incarnation of it that

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,080
was held at clemson university in south

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
carolina 10 years ago or a little over

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,320
10 years ago

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,760
and i just listened to chris debona's uh

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
um keynote and i was reminded of a lot

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
of

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,480
a lot of my ideas on kind of the

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,800
cultural foundation of open source and

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
the

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
the notion of uh project-based

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
innovation

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
um uh you know some of those ideas came

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
out of

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,360
earliest discussions with chris uh and

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,360
listening to presentations like that so

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,120
anyway it's a pleasure to be here i'll

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,280
uh i'll walk through

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,680
a series of uh of slides and talk about

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
um really how these these parallels

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
exist

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,400
in how over the last

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,960
uh 12 and a half years of doing this at

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,080
oin running oin

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
we've gone from 31 licensees to now 3

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,680
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
licensees uh and how the community has

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
grown but

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
really on the back of this notion of

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
project-based innovation

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
and how more and more people are getting

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,479
together in different technology

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,360
areas and sectors to be able to create

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,600
new novelty

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
to innovate in ways that would otherwise

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,040
not be possible

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,840
um and uh it's really uh you know

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
over over time i've come to understand

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
the

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,479
the power of this social movement uh and

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
that's where this

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,119
the modality of how we collaborate and

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
one plus one plus one doesn't equal

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,119
three it equals six or ten or twenty

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,399
when we bring smart people who are

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,560
working together

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:03,119
uh cross race cross religion cross

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,920
national boundaries there is no way to

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,520
to really turn off this social movement

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
once it started and

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
you know it's one of those things that i

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,200
think even from my conversations with uh

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
richard stallman

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,560
over the years that i don't think

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,400
richard had any

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,879
any expectation that uh that this social

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,800
component would be so powerful

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,040
and create the the the sustainability

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
of open source i mean obviously openness

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
is his thing and under he understood

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
the power of that from the beginning but

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
not the so not that it was really a

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
social movement

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
that he was ushering in that would have

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
such broad scale effect

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
on how technology is developed and how

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
we how we work

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
and and educate and learn and

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,920
participate

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
um and so it's a as i said a pleasure to

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
be here

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,080
and uh uh the one thing that a lot of

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
people a lot of audiences that i speak

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
to and i don't think this one

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,840
necessarily but

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,760
people uh often misunderstand how

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,120
uh widespread

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,959
open source is and how pretty much every

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,000
electronic touch we have

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,480
uh is enabled by open source and many

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
people think if they use an ios device

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,400
that they're uh that they're somehow

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
walled off from the open source

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
community but

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,440
in point of fact that the foundation of

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
uh of ios

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
is really built on on lots of open

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
source

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,120
code it may not be built on the kernel

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,799
but uh it's replete with open source

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
code when you look at what's inside it

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
and clearly every exchange

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,760
that we have in the in the world where

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
stocks are traded commodities are traded

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
the cloud

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
uh chris was just talking about the

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,959
proliferation

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:54,720
of uh of uh of android chrome is also

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,640
uh very broad-based uh as really the

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
realization of uh

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,879
of the whole notion of uh of thin client

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
which was talked a lot about in the 90s

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,519
and then ultimately

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,159
made possible um through uh through the

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
the uh the the sale and distribution of

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,760
lo of

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,879
affordable uh web browsing devices like

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,920
chrome

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,600
uh and so the uh

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,440
that the the way that we um invent is

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,479
one of the key kind of elements of the

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,479
social movement

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,720
and you know we're collaborating all the

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,759
time to be able to create something we

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
couldn't create in

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,720
siloed organizations and so um

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
at probably it was 11 and a half 12

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,639
years ago

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
that i met with jim zemlin and had

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,759
dinner with him in san francisco

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
and i remember him talking to me about

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,479
wanting to

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,840
uh to do something that was

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,400
embraceable by uh all manner of

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,400
companies but particularly getting more

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
medium to large-sized companies to

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
participate in open source and to not be

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,080
fear

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,639
not fear um patent risk or

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
other associated risks associated with

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,320
the use of

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,880
uh of open source code and

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
uh and he talked about licenses and he

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,039
talked about

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,400
the the notion of moving away from

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,199
gpl v3 and moving to permissive licenses

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
apache is the most common license that

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,759
they use but they also

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,479
use other permissive licenses and a lot

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,680
of those licenses unlike gpl v3

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,360
have very uh modest patent protection

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,280
components to them

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,639
uh and as a result the oins

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,919
uh uh importance became

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,080
more uh more of a point of focus uh

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
because if you are going to utilize open

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
source code and you're going to

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
collaborate techn

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
on a technical basis uh you're gonna

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,319
share ideas share code build on each

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
other's ideas and create this

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
higher levels of innovation that result

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,280
and

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,520
you're gonna do so that's in an

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,720
environment that creates inclusivity

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,440
uh and embraces diversity in order to

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,880
distill the collective intelligence the

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,120
the finest grains of value uh that that

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
drive open source innovation

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
uh and software innovation in general

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
then you're going to have to

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
figure out a way to

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,800
[Music]

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
have these projects be supported so that

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
people

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
can feel comfortable utilizing them and

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,919
so the oin model

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,759
is something that existed when he made

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,039
this decision but

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,479
we have lived in the slipstream of uh

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,080
and encouraged legal collaboration uh

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,639
in the same manner as technical

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,840
collaboration occurs since that time

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,000
uh and having people recognize that

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
when technical leads from a particular

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
project share

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,680
uh releases those releases create the

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
foundations

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,360
of of adoption and uh in order to

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,479
make those companies feel comfortable

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
oin

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
includes those that core code in what we

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
call linux system definition which is

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,599
essentially a

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,160
foundational element of that creates the

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,080
scope of the cross license that we uh we

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
are involved in and so we look at all

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,680
these projects uh

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
you know this is just a handful of

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,599
projects that come from

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
uh from the linux foundation but i could

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
look at

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
uh mike bolinovich's projects i could

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
look at the

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
apache projects and many and literally

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,560
thousands of other projects

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
and say yeah these are important

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
projects in these technology areas

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,639
whether it's

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,039
security mobility network management

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
network operation networks network

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,520
security

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
uh hyper ledger uh

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
you know obviously automotive grade

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,120
linux iot

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,479
there's so many different uh projects

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
out there that support

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,160
emerging technologies in key key sectors

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,919
and so with this notion

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,120
of coopetation this goes back really to

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,800
the 90s

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,400
when mathematicians started invading the

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
province of business school and started

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,080
talking about game theory

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
and the notion that we need to

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
collaborate more in order to more

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,440
effectively compete

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,240
and really when i first looked at open

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,639
source 12 15 years ago

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
uh 20 years ago even you know i was

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
looking at it and thinking

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,360
this seems to really be almost a

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
realization or a manifest destiny of

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,839
what

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
what those mathematicians were talking

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,279
about when they when they introduced the

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,399
notion of game theory in business

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,680
context

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,880
uh the idea that that we we have this

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,800
this uh this value that we can get but

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,120
we can't get there alone

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,839
uh we need to be doing it as part of a

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,399
community

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
and projects create community where

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
people collaborate

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,279
where they they think of things that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,519
they wouldn't have naturally thought of

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,040
and they feel this this this

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
exhilaration

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
this endorphin high of being able to to

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,320
add something to some what someone else

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
has created

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
to be able to grow something larger than

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,640
they could have grown on their own

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,920
and i i think this this parallelism is

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,399
always with me

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
uh even as i said i talked to companies

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
that you know

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
huawei just joined our community a few

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
months ago and you know huawei has 78

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
000 patents

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
canon is part of our community 83 000

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
patents i mean

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,279
you go from this this you know open

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
source collaborative environment where

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,640
people aren't thinking about things like

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,959
patents they're just thinking about

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,399
elegant code and and how you how you

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
grow that elegant code through

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
collaboration

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,399
and then on the other side of it you've

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
got you know people on the legal front

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,440
that are

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,399
that are looking at the traditional ways

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
of in

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
of inventing and protection and

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
innovation

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,079
through through the codification of

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,800
ideas

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
and that codification of ideas is been

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
around for

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
you know well over a hundred years uh to

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,640
protect some of the most

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
significant innovations in history but

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,079
uh

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,920
you know i think what open sources is is

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
forced upon the people who do the

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,440
codification on the

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,640
the mindset of those who actually are

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,360
the inventors

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,519
is the notion that that with open source

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
and open collaboration and this idea of

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,399
coopetation

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,040
we are uh collaborating

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
uh to be able to in in many different

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,839
areas

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
uh and in those areas where we

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
collaborate and rely on each other

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
uh to be able to build on each other's

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
ideas and create this this higher sense

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,720
of innovation and novelty and

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,959
inventiveness

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,000
we need to recognize that uh we also

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,720
uh um uh uh um

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
you know are are looking at if we're

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,519
really going to be

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,000
wide open so to speak and and all in to

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,920
the collaboration activity we need to

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,680
recognize that where we collaborate

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
we shouldn't be suing each other because

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,720
we need to feel comfort in adopting

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,480
that code and utilizing it in whatever

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,160
manner we choose as long as we're in

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
compliance with the license under which

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,279
the code was developed

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,399
and so when that uh

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,160
when that reality has has hit

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,399
many different industries have kind of

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,360
kind of come to open in a different way

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
and different time frame uh and you look

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
at

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
the telecom and electronics industry and

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,640
they've been

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,839
working and open for a lot longer

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,200
they're a lot more software dependent

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,920
historically but you look at you know

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,200
heavy machinery companies like kubota

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
uh you know tractor companies like john

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
deere

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,800
all these companies are moving toward uh

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,200
more the integration of more open

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
more software and as a result more open

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,079
source software

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,800
all these companies uh that are working

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,839
in this area whether it's power energy

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,279
uh

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,720
automobiles uh

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,560
machine automation all these companies

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
are coming to open source

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,720
uh in their own time their own pace but

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
what is a common element of their

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
intellectual property function

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,000
uh in these companies is a realization

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,000
that the world that was is no longer

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
and now we have to kind of recognize

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
there's there's a form of duality that

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,120
we have to understand

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,279
that's critical to the accommodation

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
of this source of incredible innovation

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,480
that comes from open source

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,200
and so uh the ip

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,519
a lot of the the work that i do is in is

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
in

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,880
socializing educating and acculturating

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
uh intellectual property department

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
leads

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
and inventors at various companies

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,120
around the world in many different

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,440
sectors

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,680
to have them understand that that this

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
isn't the end necessarily if they don't

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
want it to be many of the companies in

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,040
our community

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
uh reject the idea of software patents

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,839
that's

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
you know that's their view and and and

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,880
they can maintain that and support

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
uh uh actions to be able to ensure that

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,279
like europe that

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,600
uh uh the european patent office

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,440
that it's very very difficult to get uh

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,040
software patents granted

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
um in the u.s china japan korea very

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,959
different

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,160
uh different environments uh and

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
different approaches

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,360
but nonetheless from companies who are

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,480
extremely pro-patent to companies that

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,920
are uh extremely anti-patent

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,440
um we have created community around the

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
common notion that

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,760
that where we collaborate we shouldn't

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,120
sue each other because we need to feel

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,240
comfort in adopting

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,880
this this incredibly important code

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
there are a number of a number of

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
programs that

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,320
support patent non-aggression that oin

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,600
has given rise to

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,760
oin was formed 15 years ago

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,360
and then these other organizations to be

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,120
able to deal with patent assertion

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,120
entities or patent trolls

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
uh to be able to deal with poor quality

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
patents to

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
deal with the notion of privateering so

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,000
if somebody sells patents

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
you're protected like lot network

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,240
protects you uh there are

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,480
many different programs that that oin

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,519
success has given rise to which

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,680
which is is heartening to see because

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
what oin is focused on first and

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
foremost

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,360
is reducing risk in the community and

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,880
allowing companies to make choices

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,760
uh because of objective uh technical uh

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,240
assessments rather than because of being

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
forced into utilizing proprietary over

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,480
open

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,440
uh because of uh being held up by by a

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
patent holder

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
uh that doesn't get the notion that i

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
just described

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,440
i mean oin was formed i think it's no

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,519
no secret uh to deal with a one

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,279
particularly acute monolithic threat

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,160
represented by microsoft uh 15 16 18

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,720
20 years ago largely built on rhetoric

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,920
but also built on some litigation

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,600
uh and licensing and uh

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,160
aggressive licensing at the time and uh

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
that world has changed as we all

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,600
understand

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
the inevitability of open source is

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,480
something that i always talk to

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,120
microsoft about

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,600
uh when they were at their most hardened

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
uh

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,399
state of uh of opposition uh to

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,440
uh to open source uh 12 13 years ago

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,759
when i started doing this and uh

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
and it it's always struck me that this

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
was something that they would have to

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,040
embrace if they wanted to be able to

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
grow their business in the direction

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,079
that

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,040
that they were then very very early days

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
thinking about

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
but not actually actualizing and so oyen

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,040
was formed

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,399
with a in a context of aggression of

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,600
of passionate rhetoric uh and

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,440
uh and by microsoft and

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,040
and ultimately by some other companies

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
that were living in the shadow of open

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,839
source

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
maybe partaking of open source but but

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,880
only as

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
as users and not contributing back and

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,120
so not really understanding

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,800
the cultural imperatives of open source

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,560
and so

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,759
uh in o5 it was formed funded by ibm

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,800
red hat uh nobel at the time

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,519
sony nec and phillips google and toyota

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,440
uh joined later because of because those

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,639
are these are companies that are leaders

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,240
uh google and toyota um recognize

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,920
that uh uh that android and uh

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
google in particular recognize that

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
android and uh

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,079
and chrome uh needed leadership needed

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
someone to step

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,839
out to it's not enough just to curate

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
uh these these incredibly innovative

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
platforms

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
for uh computing and and mobile

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,919
communications

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
uh but they also needed to have a have

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,880
of stake and have a role

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,880
in ensuring that uh that the technology

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,720
the core technology that drives these

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,839
platforms was protected

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
uh whether it be the dalvik engine or

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,439
otherwise uh

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,280
toyota recognized that it was

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,039
they were two st even though they're the

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,240
they were and are the most

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,360
significant uh and largest uh

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,600
uh car maker in the world that uh they

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,760
were being

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,880
disintermediated by a uh as

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,760
uh jim zemlin likes to talk about by a

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
uh a smartphone and a piece of velcro

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
and

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
uh and that they have to be more in the

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
future than just

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
metal bending and they had to take

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,320
control and

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,600
really re-emerge as technology companies

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,559
uh not not express not relying

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,960
completely on

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,080
tier one suppliers but but being a

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
technology company

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,559
themselves and i think it's interesting

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
to see you know how again this this

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,840
transition has occurred

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,799
um from when i came into oin

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,640
that 31 licensees i mentioned to now 3

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,280
300 and counting

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
and companies all around the world uh

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,320
back then

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
uh you know you had very little open

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,120
source activity

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,320
uh in china and practically none uh

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,360
korea had some uh but it was young

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,320
and japan was the the mature player

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,559
in uh in open source with maybe uh five

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
or

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,440
five four or five years of experience

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
utilizing and experimenting with open

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
source

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,559
uh and so the the real growth over the

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
last uh

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
the last in particular five to seven

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
years in asia

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,280
and in china in particular uh is really

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,000
heartening to show that it's one world

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,600
where all all software is being

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
developed collaboratively

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
uh through this model all of the all the

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,080
open source

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
contributors and participants uh so

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
again some of the most significant

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
holders of patents in the world

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
but also companies recognizing the

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,960
importance of software to their business

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
and rec buying into this notion that uh

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,840
that there's a zone through

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,400
around which we should uh feel comfort

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,120
in terms of adoption of of open source

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
code

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,440
outside of that zone uh what people do

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
based on their own

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,039
their own strategy their own plan and

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
approach is something different

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,039
but in the core of linux and open source

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
all the core code that comes out of

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,840
these

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,840
many many many different projects this

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,480
needs to be protected

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,960
and we need to feel comfort in adoption

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
uh

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,360
oan is very much global um one of the

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
things i'm most proud of is the fact

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,440
that we have

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
expanded so significantly in uh latin

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,520
america

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
but more importantly in asia uh and we

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,520
uh

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,640
we are by design global uh and we have

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
people that work

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
with us and for us all around the world

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,039
uh in fact the majority of people are

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,960
not american that

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,919
work inside oan um

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
this is an important sub element to show

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,720
that 18

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,320
of our licensees are really in the

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
community that we built

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,520
is really in uh in latin america

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,559
uh asia pacific you know 23 and uh

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,799
and north america and europe

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,240
um this is just a representative sample

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,000
of the kinds of companies that are in

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,559
our community

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
some of the most significant companies

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,400
in their space

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,880
clearly automotive has blown up in terms

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,880
of their adoption of open source code

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
uh whether it be android for auto

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,919
whether it be

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,559
uh the uh automotive grade linux project

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
uh there are many many companies now

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
that are

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,520
are recognizing the uh from the auto

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,039
sector that are recognizing the

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,919
importance of open source

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,360
in order to allow them to re-emerge as

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,520
as toyota has

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,960
as a technology-centric company and a

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,960
technology leader

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
you know i think you look at daimler and

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
they are

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,840
uh in europe one of the most uh you know

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,159
kind of long-standing

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,240
innovators and it's nice to see them

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
adopting open source code and creating

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,080
partnerships with companies

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,600
that can help drive them to the next the

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,799
next generation

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,039
uh of vehicles um and uh

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,400
you see you know volvo and the gili

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,360
relationship

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
has been very successful renault uh you

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,320
know it's saic some of the largest

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,919
car makers in the world uh and then you

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,720
have all manner of uh

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,320
fintech companies uh sumitomo mitsui

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
bank corporation

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
uh is one of the largest banks in the

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,280
world from japan

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,600
uh it's a hyper bank uh you have ant

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,559
financial which is now ant group

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
uh the largest transactor of mobile

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,320
mobile payments

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,240
in the world on a daily basis 10 cent

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,799
which is the second largest

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
utilizing wechat pay and then union pay

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,760
which clears every one of those

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,880
transactions these are just

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,000
billions of transactions a day uh that

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,360
take place on mobile

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
devices uh in in in uh

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,520
in china and uh and you know we expect

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
that more and more companies from that

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,760
sector

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,840
uh traditional banks uh uh will

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,520
will also be participating again because

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,440
of the inevitability and the importance

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
of open source

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,880
the scope of the cross license it's kind

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,559
of important to understand

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,679
how this all kind of transpires but uh

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,600
we look at you know major project

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,360
management organizations whether it's

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,480
eclipse apache

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,360
openstack which now has has morphed into

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,039
uh it's it has now another name uh i

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,400
think in the last couple of weeks

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,600
uh and uh linux foundation obviously so

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,480
open atom is

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
is a new foundation that uh has been

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
formed in china and there are a half

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
dozen projects from some of the most

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,720
baidu ali tencent

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,280
uh 360 huawei uh

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,640
are all supporting uh an initial set of

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,440
projects there

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,600
uh and all of these project management

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,960
organizations we look at

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,960
how they're they're collaborating

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,600
technically where the important projects

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
are

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
the ones that they think are most

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,919
important and then we look at

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
at basically bringing companies together

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,520
to

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,799
to enter into a legal compact uh the

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,720
companies that participate in those

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,760
projects that are that are under these

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,320
foundations

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,320
that are most important most central to

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,279
the future of open source code

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,520
we bring them together and and and allow

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,039
them to inform our perspective on what's

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,919
most important

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,760
uh in terms of the code that they are

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,159
they're they're relying on and building

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,120
on

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,120
and what's truly core um and then that

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,240
core code becomes something that we

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,159
evaluate

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
for inclusion in the linux system

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,320
definition which is the scope of the

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,880
cross license that everybody

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,640
agrees they're they're when this cross

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
likes this cross license essentially

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,120
says that

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,200
where we collaborate we're not going to

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,600
sue each other as i described earlier

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
and specifically if you have patents

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,720
that read on

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
this that read on functionality that's

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,840
inside the core of this linux system

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
definition

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,159
you pledge to cross-license your patents

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,720
to everyone else in the community

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
uh and you pledge not to sue on core

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
linux functionality

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,039
uh it's a pretty basic concept again

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,000
that that is embraced by the most

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,120
patent-centric

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,400
to uh to the other end of the spectrum

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
of companies that are

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
antagonistic toward the whole notion of

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,120
software patenting

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,279
um and so we've created community around

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,840
the idea of collaboration

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,799
uh in the core being central and the

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640
avoidance of

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:58,080
of uh of uh of litigation

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,000
and uh and aggressive licensing programs

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,080
that would slow or stall the progress of

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
linux and discourage adoption

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,760
we have a technical committee made up of

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,640
the members of the original

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
members and and the the additional

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,240
founding members

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,480
google and toyota and we also have a

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
technical advisory council made up of 12

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,440
members from all around the world

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,600
who are incredibly software centric and

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,880
complementary to our

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,679
our core members uh funding members of

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,679
oim

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,960
so we look at kind of the evolution of

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,120
key projects

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,799
and we you know obviously linux the most

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
prolific of all projects in the open

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,360
source world but

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,559
we look at android chrome openstack we

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,840
have packages from

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,880
all of these projects uh kubernetes uh

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
docker

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,200
uh hadoop uh we're just adding hadoop

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,400
uh and kafka and so many

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,600
more project uh so many more elements of

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,679
project code

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,520
and functionality are being included the

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,400
major networking projects openapp opnfv

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
hyperledger which is blockchain code uh

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,799
that's being used by many many companies

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,760
now

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,880
uh not just banks and financial services

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,919
industry but across

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,240
industry so the scope of the cross

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,880
license is very broad

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,559
but it's really focused on uh there

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,960
comes from many different sources but

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,120
always focus on the core

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
lots of common base packages because

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,400
they're reused

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
so frequently uh there's incredible

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
reuses everyone

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,880
you know in in this audience would know

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,080
um

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,799
and enterprise is where where a lot of

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,559
a lot of linux our focus started because

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,960
a lot of linux penetration was most

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,480
significant there

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,840
and uh and so it's evolved over time

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,200
as linux as an open source have grown uh

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,679
and uh and essentially for us it's

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,559
the license is really a way of getting

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,760
to

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,760
uh building community uh companies that

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
have a common set of values and norms

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
around

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,240
how you use patents in an increasingly

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,360
open source-centric world

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,919
uh in the beginning it's uh it's a

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,360
little bit

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,400
uh off-putting for ipcentric

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,559
uh patent-centric organizations that

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
uh that put a toe in the water in open

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,320
source but over time

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,279
they see that that mastering the

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,279
licenses

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,880
on the copyright side that the projects

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
are done under that you're drawing code

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,159
from

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
is an incr incredibly important element

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,559
and there are many different tools that

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
help

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,360
people do this as well as the open chain

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,799
project which is creating

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,080
a set of of norms and a set of standards

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,799
as to how one

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,679
uh complies to ensure that compliance is

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,240
maintained

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,520
and is top of mind for anyone who adopts

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
open source code

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,760
and then on the other side of it on the

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,960
patent side oin is establishing

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,880
a again a set of norms um and

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,600
and this community is really about

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,919
opportunity and obligation

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,840
that's what open source is about where

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,080
we have this great opportunity to adopt

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,440
code and to utilize it integrated build

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,640
on top of it

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,679
but we have obligations um as well

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,000
and uh and it's this this

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,559
wonderfully elegant self-organizing kind

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,720
of component of open source that allows

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,120
this new novelty and innovation to come

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,279
about in a very organic way

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,480
but then there's also the

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,840
self-regulation and uh

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
you know you look at the software

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,799
freedom conservancy uh

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,720
harold velta in europe these are

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,679
entities that focus on

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,960
on helping companies uh maintain

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,320
compliance

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,159
helping individuals uh understand when

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,880
they're utilizing this code in a

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,559
particular

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,080
particular activity or product that

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,240
they're developing

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,480
what the obligations are what the

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
expectations are of this community

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
and i think this is one of the things

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,840
that's that's constantly evolving

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
is that this recognition of obligation

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
but i think it's incredibly important

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
because it's central to the social

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
fabric

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,760
of of what open source is about and it's

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,200
exciting when you see companies

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,760
move from from kind of that trepidation

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,840
uh to to maturity and start to

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,840
understand how to manage risk

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,240
uh associated with the use of open

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,440
source code and how that risk is really

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,200
uh not significant at all because of

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,960
organizations like oin and and uh

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,039
and other organizations that are out

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,520
there designed to

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,240
to provide help and assistance in making

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,000
sure

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,760
individual companies understand how to

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,960
comply how to work with other companies

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,919
in their sector

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,559
uh effectively how to collaborate um

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,000
it's a

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,159
it's in the beginning it's a little bit

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,200
of a leap of faith but over time

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,600
we see more and more uh this movement to

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,640
uh

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,039
to uh understanding of

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,399
of what the expectations are and that's

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,120
quite frankly why this

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,080
the growth of opens of of open source

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,640
has occurred

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,080
is the access to great technology and

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
the ability to participate in the

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,279
development of it

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,840
um but also the the oin community

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
as again in the slipstream of open

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,720
source projects

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,480
as the output source projects have grown

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,919
we've grown because the importance of

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,640
open source has spread

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,480
from sector to into sector industry to

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,120
industry

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,039
essentially people join oin because it's

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,240
about patent risk mitigation

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,159
um we're safeguarding the members

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,480
from patent risk everything we do is

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,200
free that's another important component

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,919
of this

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
um there's no no analog in the history

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,600
of

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
technology or patenting or patent pools

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,360
or

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,279
cross licenses to oin

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,440
i mean ibm and red hat and the founders

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,559
of oin deserve a tremendous amount of

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,159
credit because

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
they signed the same license as

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,159
everybody else because they have to

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
because the pro competitive platform

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,240
um and it's very important that it's a

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,880
pro-competitive platform um

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,799
and so they they put in tens of millions

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
of dollars into supporting

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,279
the administration and operation i mean

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,399
we also have we own 1300 patents and

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,320
applications

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
we spent 100 million dollars buying

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,919
those patents we make those

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,279
available on a royalty-free basis to

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,960
everyone

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,960
with those patents we've done a lot of

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
clearance in front of major open source

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,679
projects

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
we also have uh owned patents because we

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,159
wanted to have

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,120
a way of counteracting uh the negative

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,320
effects of

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,559
of litigation from uh from companies

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,799
like microsoft in the beginning

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,159
but you know as as many of you if not

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,559
all of you understand

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,519
microsoft became a participant of our

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,840
community

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,880
uh to just about two years ago and

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,519
that's uh you know

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,159
an incredibly important development uh

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
for us

00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,000
because it's a a recognition by

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,840
microsoft the importance of community

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
the importance of the the values that

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,840
oin represents and the

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,960
and the cross license that it uh that it

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,240
promulgates

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,559
and grows and we work very closely uh

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,200
with microsoft now as a matter of fact

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,240
and we partnered with them and ibm

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,200
uh and the linux foundation to uh

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,919
to fund a um an anti-troll mechanism

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,080
uh it's a an entity that uh called

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,120
unified patents which uh

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,159
attacks um and uh

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,600
and gets um uh

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,880
a the uh the invalidation of patents

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,840
that should have never been granted in

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,880
the first place

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,399
that have some element of focus on on

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,039
open source and so we

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,760
founded together the open source zone

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,360
inside unified patents so that they can

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,039
uh look at patents held by

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,679
non-practicing entities

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,000
and uh file what are called iprs against

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,039
them to have this invalidation occur

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so that the patents can't be used to uh

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,559
to attack uh companies that are adopting

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,760
uh

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,399
uh and utilizing uh linux and and uh

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,480
and other open source code and so that's

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,120
an important initiative but the symbolic

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,919
nature of bringing ibm and uh microsoft

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,559
together

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,600
uh was very important to me uh to be

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,960
able to kind of

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
validate that microsoft is doing what it

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,600
can

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,519
in the in the in the best way possible

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,799
as a citizen of this community

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,080
uh and it may have been uh slow on the

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,519
on the the uptake but it is a fast

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,240
follower and uh

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,159
and a a company that we know we can rely

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,360
on to support this uh legal

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
collaboration

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,440
that reduces risk and so we're very

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,279
happy with the partnership and relate

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,120
and that's just one manifestation of how

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,799
we're working together with them

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
um again because it has no monetary cost

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,760
it's something that

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
people look at and they go well how can

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,480
that be and you know

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,559
you have 100 billion dollars worth of

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,559
patents that you're making available on

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,799
a royalty-free basis to us

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,080
uh you have this massive cross license

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,919
where 3 million

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
patents are owned by the companies that

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,839
are part of the community

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,599
and all of them are exposed to the cross

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,639
license based on the scope

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
and how it expands

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,079
all manner of companies that that want

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,720
to feel comfortable adopting open source

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,200
code

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,760
it's almost gotten to the point where if

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,679
you don't

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
if you're utilizing open source code and

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
you don't adopt

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,079
uh uh the oin license you don't become a

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,280
licensee and participate in the

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,480
community and the cross

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,159
license then it's almost some for it's

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,520
really is a form of private-facing

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,800
negligence where you

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,960
you're being negligent and exposing

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,359
your your the technology that you've

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,560
adopted from the open source

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:56,000
projects that you you work in uh

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,040
to uh to patent risk and so um it's also

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
become a

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,480
sense of and this is one of the things

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,200
that that was played back to be my

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,400
by microsoft i mean they're obviously

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,160
very

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,320
they want to hire the best people in the

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,839
world and the best coders in the world

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
and the encoders are

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,359
are very uh politically sensitive uh

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,359
politically aware

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,720
legally aware it's a very interesting

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,320
community uh

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,560
because of the awareness and the

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,400
knowledge of of coders

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,599
and one thing that's not lost on them is

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,119
the sense of uh

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,640
how do you behave what is what is your

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,800
what is your how do you participate in

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,960
this community are you authentic

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,800
or are you not authentic and the the

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,760
goal of being authentic and being able

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
to hire

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,400
against google and and facebook and

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,160
uh and all the other companies

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,760
amazon all the other companies that are

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,560
active in their markets

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
where they want to hire they wanted to

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,000
you know show it

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,960
send out a message um you know github

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
was a message

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
and an important investment for them i

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
think oin

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,440
is an equally important uh um

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,359
investment for them in terms of

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
committing their patent portfolio to the

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,079
cross license

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,240
and the um and that the nature of what

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,640
they've done is really shows that their

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,880
this this idea of authenticity is one

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,839
that they're very much committed to

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,480
uh they want to be authentic and and and

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,119
you know i'm

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,240
gratified that that what we've done and

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,320
been working on

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,079
in terms of building community through

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
the license over and expanding the

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,040
license to cover important code

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,400
that those actions are appreciated uh by

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,599
what was the

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,720
the most significant uh uh antagonist

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,320
to uh to linux and open source uh just

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,320
uh 10 10 years ago and so that

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,480
idea of authenticity is another reason

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,240
why people want to join oin

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,359
in fact we did a survey not long ago

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,280
of uh of the 250

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
largest patent-holding companies in our

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,040
community

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,839
uh and asked them why they participate

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
in oin

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,920
is it the cross license is it access to

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,720
our patents that we own

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,800
uh is it this notion of authenticity the

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,640
whole notion of of community

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,079
that they wanted this is what you do

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,000
when you're when you're

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,280
when you're joining the open source

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,240
world and you're

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,440
joining projects and taking code and

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,640
utilizing it

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,240
um that it's it's who you are and

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,119
it's actually the this last point

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,720
uh as we've done these surveys now too

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,440
over the last four years

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,119
we see in a trend that seems to be

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,839
appearing where companies

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,680
uh recognize how important this this is

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,960
and how important being authentic in the

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
community is

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,200
uh to being a good citizen of the

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,200
community and so uh

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
you know again i'm gratified by that

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,920
because it's uh

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,440
it's what i've always seen from the

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,880
beginning um

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,280
that companies again that they reckon

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,560
they have to recognize the obligation

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,680
and oin is is becoming an obligation

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,079
and a litmus test for authenticity uh

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,400
for

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
for many many companies in the community

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
and so

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
at the end of the day the only companies

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,839
that are not joining

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,760
the joining oin that are where their

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,720
companies actually are committed to open

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
source

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,440
uh our companies that want to reserve

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
the right to sue on core linux and open

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,760
source functionality and

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,800
and that list is is shrinking every day

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
fortunately

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,240
as we bring more and educate as we're

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
educating more and more companies and

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
bringing them into the community

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,760
and so uh again i appreciate the

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,119
opportunity to be

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,119
be here uh and uh from the

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,480
10 years ago when i first spoke at uh at

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,440
one of todd's events to today uh it's uh

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,720
it's great to see the growth of this of

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,760
this community

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,400
uh now you know having a home in uh

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,599
research triangle park uh and now a

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,720
virtual home

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,960
uh temporarily as we deal with covet but

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
uh you know it's uh it's it's a

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,520
testament to how

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,720
how um authenticity in this world is

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,720
also important

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,320
uh because the people who run this and

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,079
the people i've been associated with

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
over the years speaking at it

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
uh our our peop are the kind of people

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,440
who are the foundation of the open

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
source community

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
and it's nice to see when they're

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,800
running events and uh and

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,880
and such a sense of community is in

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,520
evidence uh whether virtually or in

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,040
person

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,040
so thank you very much

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,920
thank you kid this is really an

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,480
interesting talk

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,960
i thoroughly enjoyed and i hope all of

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,119
the participants

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,480
so if if any one of you have any

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,320
questions

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,720
we can stay here for a couple of more

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
minutes

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,240
if not then i actually have a quick

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,040
question

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,839
um i'm a phd student at nc state i was

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,800
thinking how

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,599
should i really think about uh

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
considering

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,200
academic research in the ecosystem of

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,160
oin

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,960
are in the open source in open source

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,640
com

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,640
ecosystem specifically

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:25,200
uh what is your what's your phd in

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,319
computer science i'm doing my ai and

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,160
machine learning for

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,720
some of this very specific model based

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,359
uh model-based machine learning okay

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
well

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,880
i think one of the things is having the

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,599
right mindset approaching

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,800
uh participation in a career in computer

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
science and

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
you know an open source is as i said it

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,640
there's a permanence

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,839
this isn't about it's it's not and it's

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,079
it would never will be about

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,040
disintermediate

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,119
one player and doing a workaround and

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,480
creating an alternative technology that

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,440
gets adopted

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,440
open source isn't about the tech it it

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,480
the byproduct of the activity is

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,640
is technology but its main

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
purpose is to be able to create and

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,040
stimulate

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,240
new ideas where that were not

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,640
conceivable

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,000
by one individual or not and it could

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,359
not be as elegant

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,040
if they were not built on and i'd say um

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,280
understanding the social um requirements

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,160
of participation in the community

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,040
and always having that top of mind the

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,000
benefits that we get out of this this is

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,920
this is the the you know kind of the

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,200
quietest revolution

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,319
but it is in fact a revolution i i'm in

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,760
china all the time

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,800
normally um i travel typically 270

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,880
to 300 days a year and i'm constantly on

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,160
the road in china seven or eight times

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,200
and i i i have to kind of be

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,800
somewhat amused by it doesn't matter

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:04,000
what the regime is whether it's

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,319
our flavor of uh democracy

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,839
france's faith flavor of democ of of

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,040
social democracy

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,680
uh whether it's a communist country that

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,839
has an

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,200
incredibly active capitalist uh driven

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,560
economy um

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,640
everyone as long as you have networks

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,040
and the opportunity to participate

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,000
is contributing collaborating and

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,560
working together

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,079
irrespective of whether you know donald

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,720
trump doesn't get along with

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,920
uh so and so in another country and they

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,400
have a battle

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,000
or their trade wars or trade issues

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,400
we're all collaborating

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,880
and in their ways of dealing with things

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,440
you look at the the movement of uh

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:50,319
of projects um uh mike bolinovich's uh

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,440
project eclipse is now based in in

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,359
brussels

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,200
um you know we are through policies

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,319
we're creating environments

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,800
in that that we work in um that that are

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,920
less favorable or more more appealing or

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,240
less appealing

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,839
than others and i think it's it's

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,480
important to recognize that

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,079
no matter where we decide to live we

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,520
have the ability to collaborate

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,079
and we don't have to the the the

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,119
historically you know i think it was

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,599
it's incredibly

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,520
debilitating on families to have to

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,359
relocate you know you get

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,839
you're in north carolina but uh you know

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,359
if i think of the 90s we had this mass

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,560
exodus from europe

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,920
from from india from china

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,640
from uh even japan korea

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,440
people coming to route 128 or even to

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,480
rtp

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,240
or to go to uh to silicon valley where

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
they could get access to capital

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,200
talent and and and resource to be able

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,520
to support their their business ideas

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,200
now i think we can we can invent more in

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,760
situ where we are

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,960
uh we're not having to relocate

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,040
dislocate

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,040
uh from our families to be able to kind

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,960
of access this open source

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,119
world and i think that's an important

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,160
thing because quality of life

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,480
as we think about it now is it's just

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,160
too

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,599
important um for us to uh to make

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,640
sacrifices that

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,440
that will will engender regret uh or

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,920
create uh social division i think what

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,319
we want is to be able to be unified

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,319
uh wherever we are and and make good

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,760
choices about where we are and where we

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,760
work where we live

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,760
uh and it's and it's not only the

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,160
location of where we decide to live but

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,720
it's

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,240
who we work with and i think one of the

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,280
points that chris made in his

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,520
his presentation earlier his keynote

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,880
is is incredibly true and something i

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,280
found to be true on my

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,280
you know my own exploration experience

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,400
there's such good people in open source

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,599
they're people who

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,319
who recognize that the benefit of of

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,119
listening

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,960
of understanding of collaboration and

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,560
that's one thing that i would look at in

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,680
my career if i were you

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,079
and i really want to have is the ability

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,040
to make

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
choices about how and what i work on uh

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,359
the ability to be appreciated

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,599
not just by the per the company i work

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,040
for but by the community in which i work

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,800
the project community and recognize that

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,040
the freedom

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,680
of being able to do these things is

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,200
incredibly powerful and enabling

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,800
um and also just you know when you think

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,480
about the kind of life that you want to

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,599
have

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,640
you know working in open source to me is

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,560
is something that that is very accretive

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,640
to being able to create quality of

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,040
experience and the ability to

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,960
to be a lifelong learner and for people

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,880
to recognize that leadership

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,040
is not what we should be looking for but

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,960
we should be looking for learnership

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,200
people who are lifelong learners who can

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,440
then can contribute back in ways that

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,319
that that traditional management theory

00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,319
doesn't understand

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,319
yeah absolutely i agree with that yeah

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,960
i think it is quite insightful thank you

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,000
once again

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,160
to be part of ato oh it's my pleasure

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,280
and uh and to anyone who attended thank

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,560
you very much for the

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,200
opportunity and uh and guys coming on
