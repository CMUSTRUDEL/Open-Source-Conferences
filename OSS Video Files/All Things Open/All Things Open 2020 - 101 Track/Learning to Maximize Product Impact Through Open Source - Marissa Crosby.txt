all right well thanks so much for having

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,120
me today i'm super excited to share

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
my journey a little bit around a

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,080
opportunity that i recently had at my

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,119
company optum

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,760
to take a product that we were going to

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
release and solely have as an internal

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
product for our own developers in the

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
company

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
and the journey that we actually took to

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
end up open sourcing it and what it

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
takes to be successful in that realm

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
of having an internal product that might

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
be productionized but actually

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,440
also having a component of it that's

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,800
open source so kind of walking through a

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
little bit of what that journey looks

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,760
like

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800
but i actually wanted to go ahead and

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,559
start with

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
a little bit of an ice breaker i'm kind

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,719
of curious for the

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
people on this call have you ever worked

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
on something

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,079
that might provide provide value beyond

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,559
the walls of your company so curious to

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
see

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,760
if you've ever found yourself in a

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,039
scenario where you were

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
you know working on something but you

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
kind of wonder in the back of your mind

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
you know is this something that would be

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
actually valuable

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
beyond my company outside of that you

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
know maybe it was

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
a unique solution to a tough problem an

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,400
innovative

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
innovative type of way to use tools that

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
already exist or maybe just a complete

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,720
gap in the market you find yourself

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
wondering wow

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,000
it'd be so cool to share this out

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
all right probably but they would not

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
allow sharing yeah exactly exactly so

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
i'm going to cover a little bit on that

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
today too as well

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,080
absolutely perfect thank you for the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,439
responses

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,079
so as a follow-up then

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,400
for those of you that said yes was any

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240
kind of path pursued to be able to share

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
this information publicly

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
so same kind of thing in the chat yes no

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
kind of

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
and you know that could be anything from

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
actually open sourcing it on github to

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,640
blog you know some kind of public type

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,079
of information

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
were you able to move forward with that

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
idea

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
i'm just taking taking a quick look at

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
the chat um

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,880
oh yes cool very awesome not allow

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
sharing so that might be

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,719
you know that might have been one of the

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
big blockers to doing that as well

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,560
um perfect all right well for the folks

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,759
that actually were able to pursue a path

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
forward i'd love to connect some time

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,400
and learn a little bit more about how

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
that worked

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
but today i'm here to actually talk a

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
little bit more

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
about my experience with that talk uh so

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
i'm gonna go ahead and kick off the talk

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
just

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
introducing me and the company i come

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
with optum and share a little bit about

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
a use case where we had an internal

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
product that we wanted to

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
open source and what what did that look

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
like and i won't actually be you know

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
using this as a promotion for that

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
product or anything but just an example

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
throughout on some of the steps that we

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
took to be successful

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
and then diving into kind of the content

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,360
for today i'm going to talk a little bit

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
about

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
key steps that my team kind of followed

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
and encountered throughout this journey

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
that i think would be good to pass on

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
for anyone

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
that is looking at taking this kind of

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
route forward so talking about designing

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
from the outside in

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,959
building it smarter and then being able

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
to launch prepared and successful

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,480
and then also i want to add a little bit

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
of time at the end too to talk about

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,159
what happens after the first launch how

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,280
can you continue to be successful and

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
then we'll wrap

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
with a summary and then if you have any

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
questions feel free to throw them in

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
chat as we go and then we'll

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
we'll save some time at the end to come

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
back to those as well

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
i just want to start with a very brief

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
introduction so my name is marissa

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,840
crosby i am a product manager with optum

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,440
based out of minnesota aka silicon

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
valley i've been with optum for about

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
six years

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,319
um one of the things actually before

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
taking on this role i was a developer so

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,120
i've really found

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
a lot of benefit in bringing that

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
perspective into my product management

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
practices being able to understand

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,480
and look at a scenario not just from you

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
know the business needs

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,080
business and customer needs standpoint

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
but also from the technology as well

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
and how do you work to build a great

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
product in harmony between your business

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
and your technology

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
i'm also really passionate about women

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,799
in technology and i spend a lot of time

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
uh also working with toastmasters so

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,920
working to help people

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
find their voice and build networks

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,040
within within the company and abroad as

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
well too

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,159
currently within my current role we're

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,760
actually working on

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,239
simplifying and increasing cloud

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
adoption so finding ways to make it

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,200
easier to modernize what you're doing

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
and move to the cloud essentially

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,479
i had a really cool opportunity it was

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,479
about december of last year

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,239
to do an open source launch at aws re

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,440
invent with a product called disposable

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,960
cloud environment

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
it was a really cool opportunity so i'm

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
going to be focusing a lot of today's

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,759
presentation

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,880
around what it took to get us up to that

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,320
open source launch

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,400
and then how do we continue on

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
successfully as well too and with that

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,919
it's really a product that

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,080
helps developers get almost instant

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
access into the public cloud and be able

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,639
to

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
to start learning exploring complete uh

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,080
completing proof of concept so we'll

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
cover that a little bit more

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,880
and then i'll just very briefly

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
introduce optum so if you're familiar

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
with

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
united health group and united

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
healthcare optum is really the

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,520
technology arm behind the scenes kind of

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,720
powering

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
a lot of what you would think of as kind

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
of the traditional insurance or pharmacy

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
benefits management but really looking

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,440
at

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
the overall consumer experience clinical

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,400
experience and then

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
data and analytics is another big area

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
that we do to kind of partnering with

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
universities and doing a lot of

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
different research and things there but

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
ultimately really working to make the

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,320
health system work better for

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,759
everybody behind the scenes kind of

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
coming at it from the technology

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,440
perspective

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,039
all right so i'm going to go ahead and

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
start off by talking a little bit about

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,800
an open source product opportunity that

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
we recently had at optum

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
and actually in order to do this i'm

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
going to step back a little bit and do

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,840
some storytelling so

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
we had a problem within the company

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
around large-scale

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,039
public cloud learning environments you

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
might think well that's that's really

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
strange why would that be a problem

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
stepping back a little bit when we first

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
started our cloud journey at this

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,280
company within the last three four years

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,600
what ended up happening was we created a

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,199
process and a way to get access to

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
enterprise approved accounts

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
and as part of that process teams really

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,080
had to demonstrate that they understood

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080
the responsibilities heightened security

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
how this environment is really different

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,639
from what you can expect from an on-prem

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
uh data center type of development

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,080
and that was really necessary to make

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
sure that we the teams that were moving

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
forward you know weren't putting the

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,400
company at risk at a whole they knew

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,680
what they knew what they were doing

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,319
they were good candidates to be

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
operating in the public cloud

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
but that learning model that model

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,720
didn't really work for teams that

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,800
wanted to just learn explore maybe try a

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,479
few things out create a proof of concept

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
and then throw it away when they're done

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
what ended up happening was these teams

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
would be

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,120
queued amongst other teams that

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
were waiting to get in line so it would

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
be a long wait to get into your account

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,639
and then you would potentially get your

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,440
turn to present your case and get into

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
your account

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
and then that's when teams would often

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
find themselves being denied because

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
they don't

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
know what they wanted to do in the

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
public cloud and how they would do it

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,800
successfully but it was kind of a

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,880
chicken chicken in the egg problem how

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
do you create and offer learning

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
accounts for people with

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
a low bar to entry where we also have

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
some extra kind of security in place as

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
well too so as we're

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,240
learning and exploring the public cloud

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,880
it is really easy to make you know

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,479
makes mistakes as far as like security

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,319
cost control budgets

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,319
and then a lot of times too when people

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,080
were done with their exploration these

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
accounts would just be left over

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,000
for a maintenance or operations team to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
clean up and take care of

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
so we were looking with looking to and

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,880
working with our cloud provider partners

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
to really figure out how can we get some

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
of some more functionality in place so

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
that we can actually have accounts

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
that are managed but more so temporary

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
and controlled

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,759
that makes sense for people that we're

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
learning um so kind of the taking the

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,560
traditional product management type

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,759
route yeah are we gonna build it are we

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
gonna buy it or we can outsource this

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639
what are we gonna do

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
and we worked with the cloud providers

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,599
and we found out that this this need

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
really wasn't

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
on their road maps um they understood

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
that there were some gaps in how people

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
work and learn in the cloud but it

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
wasn't really on their radar to create

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
something

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
to solve this problem so we actually

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
decided to go ahead and build out this

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,039
solution

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
and we worked really closely with our

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,280
cloud providers to have the conversation

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
around you know if we were to build this

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,879
how do we make it successful what do we

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
need how is this going to line up with a

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,680
long-term roadmap

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
and this so through this process we

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
worked really closely with aws

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
and as we were talking to some of their

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
customers and kind of finding out some

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
of the needs

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
that they had the question came up well

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
do you want to open source it everybody

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
just keeps asking

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,639
can they just have this so that really

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
opened up the whole new realm of

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,680
possibility for the team thinking about

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
what it would take

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,519
to offer this as an internal product but

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,039
also with an open source component as

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,560
well too

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
and initially that just opened up the

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,120
door to a whole lot of different

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
challenges and things that we had to

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
tackle

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
so the first off it was really a new

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
space for delivery teams we are pretty

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,440
confident with how we build

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
deploy manage and handle technology

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
within the company for

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,760
you know internal customers or maybe

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
even external customers

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
but we really weren't sure how you would

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
do an open source

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
component to this other product as well

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
too

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
and then like i mentioned this was a big

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,839
need within the company to get people

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
ramped up and learning in the cloud

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,760
quickly

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
and so we had already actually started

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
an internal implementation

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,839
that we weren't planning on open

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,760
sourcing so we had to figure out okay

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,000
what does that mean is this worth it

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,519
um and then with the offer to open

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
source as well too aws

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,519
had asked if we would like to launch it

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
at their reinvent conference so we had

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
just a few

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
few months to really finalize the

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,519
details but after we

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,360
continued talking to other people with

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,519
interest we realized yeah this this is

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,399
worth it let's do it

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
and then that that led naturally to a

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
lot of questions

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
on what are you doing and why are you

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,800
doing that

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
so i want to start by clarifying a

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
little bit what i'm talking about when i

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,720
say an open source product

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,040
so i'm talking about going beyond just

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
consuming or contributing to projects

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
upstream

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
or bringing them into your current

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
technology i'm actually talking about

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
designing

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,040
and building a product with the

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,160
intention to eventually open source the

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
software the code

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
itself and that could mean you know

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
depending on what your team

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
your company's goals and ambitions are

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
that could actually mean

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
building and moderating a public

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,920
community in addition to managing your

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
own internal offering

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
which really kind of a new model for

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
teams to try and wrap their head around

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
and the other area that makes the open

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,240
source product more successful is if

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,320
you're actually thinking about it from

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
a product mindset as opposed to a

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,240
short-term i.t project

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,600
so you want to make sure that when

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,800
you're thinking about you know is this

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
something i would want to do

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,279
you have a long-term plan you want to

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,240
continue delivering value and evolving

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,240
this product

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,320
it's not something that you would want

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
to kind of build quickly put on the

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
shelf and then have

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,079
you've never had never touch it again

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
that there wouldn't really be the kind

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,959
of scenario that we're talking about

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
here

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,480
so once we got that figured out a little

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
bit about what that would look like

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,920
had to answer a lot of questions on why

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
why would this be worth the extra effort

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
to a development team

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
and ultimately it came down to

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
leveraging the benefits that come with

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,959
open source

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
in combination with product management

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,800
best practices

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
will actually help drive more value for

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
your product

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
and the reason behind that is a lot of

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
the good the good things that come with

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,399
a strong

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,160
successful open source community are the

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
things that you're already going to need

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
to be successful in product management

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
you want that continuous feedback you

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
want your technical implementation to be

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,880
really solid quality

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
extendable you want your developers to

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
be happy

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
engaged motivated ready to build the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
next feature you want to keep pace with

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
industry trends and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,560
ideally if you have a community that's

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,040
healthy and engaged on the open source

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
side

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
they're going to maybe help you with

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,279
some of the things that you're excited

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
about as far as enhancements or bug

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,240
fixes

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160
so throughout this presentation i'm

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
going to hit on areas specifically where

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
you could see some of these benefits

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
but that's ultimately what we why we

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
decided to move forward with open

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
sourcing what we were doing because we

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
really just

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
saw so much benefit in harnessing that

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
community

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,639
and then if that wasn't enough of a

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
reason a lot of studies have really

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,440
shown that

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
institutions that fail to engage with

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
open source will fall behind those that

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
use it effectively

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
and coming from a more of a product

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,720
management mindset

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,399
i see engaging with open source as more

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
than just like we talked about before

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,639
consuming contributing but actually

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,360
starting to think about open source as

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,560
your product

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,160
model how are you going to build and

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
launch a product open source does that

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
make sense

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
how can you get more value out of what

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
you're doing from that product

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
perspective

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,120
by adding an open source component to

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,120
what you're doing

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,959
with that i want to talk about some key

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,600
steps that our team used

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
to be successful in this area and how

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
following through these steps actually

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,320
can help you maximize your product your

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,680
product input

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,519
they talked about designing from the

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
outside in building smarter and then

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
launching prepared

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
and not to be a downer or anything but

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
before we go into designing from the

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
outside in i do want to add a little bit

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
of a disclaimer

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
one thing that i have noticed within the

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,920
enterprise is that

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,160
you know sometimes open source is

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,959
definitely has a lot of myths that go

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,760
with it

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,240
it's not going to be a magic solution to

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,360
understaff development teams

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
this is actually going to be a

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
commitment above and beyond

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,560
what it would take to traditionally

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,120
deliver and launch a product so you want

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
to make sure that your teams

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,639
are staffed appropriately and ready to

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
be successful in this area so

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,720
by taking the core of what you're

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,320
building and open sourcing it

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
it's not going to maintain or

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,360
productionize that solution within your

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,279
company it's kind of an

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,720
extra thing to think about and gain

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,639
value from

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
and then similarly community activity is

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
also going to be heavily influenced by

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,920
your moderator team

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
and if your team is stretched really

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
really thin and can't contribute the

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,839
time

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
that they need to keeping this open

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
source community

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,079
thriving and successful you're going to

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
see that that community just kind of

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
falls off as well too so you want to

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
make sure that you're really aligned

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,920
and planning for the long term but

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
okay let's say you have that all checked

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
off the first thing you really want to

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,399
do

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,519
in this area is think about the qua the

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
problems

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,399
that your product is going to solve

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,079
having a good understanding of

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
who you're targeting and why and what do

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
you hope to achieve

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
but then starting to understand a little

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
bit more about what's going on

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
outside of your organization so leaning

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,160
on some of those

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
whether it's a vendor contact or any

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,199
kind of information you can get from

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
folks on the outside

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
to see how similar your problems are and

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,360
if you're looking to consider it should

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
should this product go open source

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
you're going to want to see where that

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
overlap is and try and focus in on that

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,399
and determine if you have a valuable

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
enough use case and scenario to really

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,800
move forward and put the effort into

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
making this successful

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
and ideally as you continue this

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,959
activity make more connections you're

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
going to hopefully see

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,240
that those two circles are going to

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
overlap a lot and that's going to

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,880
indicate that you have a really strong

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
opportunity

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
that a lot of people would be interested

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
in and it's going to be successful to

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
get off the ground

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,800
going back to the product disposable

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,440
cloud environment that we launched

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
we knew at the very high level that

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,959
there were limited options for cloud

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
provider solutions at scale

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
we knew that was a problem there wasn't

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,480
a whole lot of support there but as we

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,760
started talking to people more and more

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
we realized that the feature set that we

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
needed

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
was also the same feature set that

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
people outside of our company needed as

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,440
well too

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
the ability to control costs the ability

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,199
to access it quickly

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120
reusability of some of these accounts

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,279
some of the flexibility around how you

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,040
work with it how you deploy it

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,040
all of these things we realized came

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,959
together really really nicely and made a

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,800
strong open source

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
story to tell so we decided to go ahead

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,639
and move forward with that

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,199
based on that analysis but going back a

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
little bit

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,720
why would you take the time to start

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
this activity and do this what what

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,680
value is this going to give you for your

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
product in the end

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,959
and ultimately it's starting to build

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,639
your community early it's almost like

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,240
marketing before it's ready getting

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
people excited and interested in what

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
you're doing

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,040
and you're going to gather some of the

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,120
fresh perspectives and feedback early

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,759
together to really understand how you

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,279
can take your product to the next level

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,959
similarly you'll get more pulse on

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
industry trends as well too being able

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,600
to have

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,040
an understanding of what's out there and

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
what people are looking for and this is

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,199
an activity that actually continues

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,720
across the product like life cycle to

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,880
make sure that you continue on the same

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,279
path there

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,240
and then next up so after we did our

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,720
initial

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,320
design analysis figured out who we're

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
targeting what features do they care

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
about

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,120
that's where we realized pretty quickly

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,279
that taking this approach

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
really flipped the traditional product

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,800
and how it's developed on its head

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,440
so thinking about traditional products

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
your end users are going to be consuming

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
the features that you provide

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,399
there's probably little or no engagement

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
with your delivery teams

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,920
and some of your implementation choices

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
are likely going to be obscured

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
people will download the technology

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
download the app work with it

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,759
they're not going to know how you deploy

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,000
it how you test it and then similarly to

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
any time that you have problems or you

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,839
would like a feature request

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,039
those often will go through a formal

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,280
process

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
where then product and team and

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,959
engineering takes a look at it

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,880
it breaks it down determines it adds it

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,319
to the roadmap releases it on a fixed

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,600
schedule

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,360
but what you're going to see by having

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,520
an open source component

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,439
is that your end users are actually now

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,720
going to be developers and testers of

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,400
the product

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
you're going to have potentially direct

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,080
communication with your delivery teams

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
especially if it's the same team kind of

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,039
doing that moderation activity with an

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
open source

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,720
so you want to make sure that your

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
implement implementation choices are

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
really solid

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,720
that you're not trying to hide any bad

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
technical skeletons in the closet

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
because in this in this type of scenario

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
and operating model

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,080
it does matter and with that too

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
enhancements and issues

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
can be added and talked about at any

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,160
time so making sure that you have a

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
solid process in place to understand

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
how do you handle that and how do you

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,200
work on that and then another big area

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,520
that was really interesting for my team

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,880
too was the the parallel implementations

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
trying to understand

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
a little bit about what does it mean if

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,679
you have

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
functionality that you don't want to

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,080
open source but your team still needs it

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
and their

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
your company still needs it in their

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,880
production implementation

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,160
we realize really quickly this can lead

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
to a whole bunch of things that teams

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,320
are going to have to figure out

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,080
um but really kind of going back to the

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,200
why go through this activity of building

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
smarter

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,799
overall it's just going to help you have

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,039
a higher quality software

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,799
higher quality software overall but just

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,400
looking at that implementation making

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,240
sure that you have

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
flexibility in your product that you can

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,679
work around some of those requested

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,080
features and then the community left out

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,320
as well

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,360
as a really big one being able to

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
understand

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,559
how to funnel that through and how to

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,240
bring that back into your team and then

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,120
keeping pace with industry trends was

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,360
another one

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,880
that was really big too you know if you

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
are using something

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
in your open source repository that's

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,080
maybe

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,000
very out of date not good practice

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
you're either going to hear about it in

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,080
an issue or people are just going to go

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
away and think that you aren't really

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
ready

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
this product isn't worth their time to

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
continue working with so it's really

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
important

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
to actually think more about what is the

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,400
technical

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,080
implementation technology behind the

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,679
scenes and not just the delivery of

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,600
those features

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,200
what item one thing i can add here kind

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,280
of going back to my example with

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
disposable cloud environment

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
was around the increased flexibility so

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,280
if we think about the implementation

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,880
that we wanted to provide to developers

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,960
within optum

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
they would access public cloud accounts

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
and use them for their learning

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,919
activities

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
but they really weren't going to be

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,880
deploying

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,880
a system to manage these accounts they

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,360
were really just using those features

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
so as we talked to people outside of the

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,520
company that were actually looking to be

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,039
administrators of this system really

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
kind of following the core of what we're

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,880
trying to do with the open source

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
they cared a lot more about how you

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
deploy this product

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
there's a lot of strong opinions around

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
which type of technology to use

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,080
and our team had the choice of using an

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,240
in-house system

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
like that we would use for deployments

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
or

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
going with something a little bit more

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
cloud native a little bit more open

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,200
source friendly

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,720
so that we could support the people that

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,159
would really actually care more about

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
deploying the system which would be our

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
open source users

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
so we did decide to go ahead with that

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
other choice that was a little bit more

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
open source friendly cloud native and

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,240
that just helped us overall with

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
increased flexibility in the future

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,520
being able to provide

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
multiple ways for administrators to

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,000
deploy this system and that was

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,840
something that

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
before we started doing this activity we

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
hadn't really thought too much about

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,159
because it wasn't

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,440
wasn't kind of as important as once we

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,200
started realizing

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
feedback from open source as well too so

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,320
again really just the quality

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
implementation and flexibility are going

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,200
to be driven

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,720
by being able to build it smarter than

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
you would otherwise

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,520
all right launching prepared so we did

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,440
our design we did our build

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
and then we were ready to launch at our

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,520
aws re event

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
event and this is where i really want to

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
emphasize that you don't want to

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,640
underestimate the small stuff

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
that goes along with trying to bring a

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
product out to the public and into the

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
market

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,600
so one of the first things that you

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,240
really want to make sure you have a good

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,480
handle on

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
is your open source strategy and you can

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
do this the same way you would with any

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,919
other type of product management

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
what are your kpis what do you want to

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,600
get out of this product do you

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,640
care about number of pull requests stars

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,159
issues forks unique contributors trying

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
to figure out a little bit about what's

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
going to

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
what success means for this initiative

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,360
and making sure that you're ready to

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,840
handle it when people actually have

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,600
pull requests and and issues that they

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,200
want to bring into this product

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,640
understanding that you're ready to

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
handle that community growth and

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
adoption are going to be really really

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
successful

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
really it's something you're going to

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,080
need to be successful going into

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
kind of the next phase after your first

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,520
launch

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,799
and the other two yeah it seems kind of

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
simple but you wouldn't definitely

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,320
wouldn't want to forget it is your

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
product name and legal and ip

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,679
and this really just gets down to making

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
sure that what you're

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,679
putting out in the open source world

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
behalf of your enterprise

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
really meets what they expect for

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,799
corporate compliance so this is where if

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,919
your organization has an open source

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,520
program office

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
i would definitely recommend leaning on

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,159
that as much as you can making sure that

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,159
your

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
your name meets branding guidelines it's

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
not already used

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
you're using a license that's

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
appropriate for what you're what your

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
company wants to achieve in the open

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,960
source space

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,120
really just checking all those dots

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,440
definitely far enough ahead of time

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
with that too comes another look at

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,120
security and what you're building and

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,640
putting out you want to make sure that

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
especially if you're following a

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
scenario where maybe you started

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,280
building a product and then decided to

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
open source it

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,159
making sure that you don't have anything

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
within that code base that could

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
potentially be confidential that you

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
wouldn't want to release out to the

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,919
public so there's a lot of different

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,520
compliance checkpoints that you'll want

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
to make sure that you follow

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,559
before just releasing it on behalf of

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,960
your company that you come with

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,480
and then exceptional documentation is

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
huge as well too and that really just

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
gets into

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,799
the positive first impressions you know

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
i think

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,120
typically there's a little bit of a

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,440
culture within the enterprise of

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,960
the documentation is good enough well

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,320
good enough doesn't really cut it in

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,120
open source if you

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,120
if your users can't figure out how to

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,679
deploy this system that you've put out

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
there

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,159
they don't understand how to work with

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
it they don't understand how to

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
contribute to it

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,039
it's going to be really hard to keep

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
people interested and engaged and build

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
out that that community of feedback that

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
you really need

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,400
if they're kind of turned off from the

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
whole thing right away because they

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
couldn't get through the documentation

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
one of the things we did leading up to

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,880
our public launch was we actually

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,919
had some of our early early testers

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
early adopter

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,360
folks try deploying the system that we

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
had put out there

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,880
we wanted to see how long did it take

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
from start to finish to be able to stand

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
this up and we had set

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,520
you know a threshold of like if it was

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,600
more more than an

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
hour the documentation and the way that

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,840
we had set this up was not good enough

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
and we went back and we continued to

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,600
do that activity refine the

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,799
documentation until we got to a point

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,360
where people felt that yes i i can come

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
into this

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,200
this open source repository understand

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
what i'm doing and be up and running

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
very quickly

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,080
you know we thought that if it was going

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,400
to take

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,320
days or weeks that we really missed the

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
mark we needed to make this simple as

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,320
possible so looking at

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
documentation how thorough is it does it

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,159
include everything from

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,120
testing to security to standards to

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
deployment

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,159
covering all of that and then even

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,000
automating some of those documentation

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,279
processes will also definitely be worth

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,799
it in the long run as well too

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,120
all right so we did our first launch and

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,520
it was great and we're done yay

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,360
no just kidding um actually going back

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,480
to my earlier slides around product

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
management

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,679
the first launch is really just the

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,000
beginning you now actually have to go

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
back

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
through and repeat all those steps that

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,559
you had done before making sure that you

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,240
are adjusting the changes in the market

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,679
capturing the latest problem that's the

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,679
most interesting

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,679
really continuing to feed this community

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,520
in this initiative

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
so as you're doing that it's going to be

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,159
really important to make sure that you

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,520
take care of your development team this

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,679
is this is different than

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,440
building a traditional product one of

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,480
the first ones that my team hit on

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,440
pretty quickly was

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
establishing communication boundaries so

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,320
kind of going

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,279
back to that the scenario of what it's

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
like to develop

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,279
inside the enterprise versus out you

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,760
know sometimes people

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
or developers on teams would have

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,520
conflict over

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,120
github pull requests or issues one

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,760
person saying no i think it needs to be

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
this way

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,880
somebody else says no i really think it

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,640
needs to be this way

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
um you want to be careful with that kind

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
of communication when you have an open

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,840
source product

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
you don't want to erode trust in what

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,520
you're doing you want your contributors

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,080
to feel that your core team

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,039
is aligned has a plan and is moving

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,120
towards that plan

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,159
and isn't just you know fighting in

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
total chaos

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
so one of the things that we recommended

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,159
for our team is you know making sure

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,279
that we have communications like that

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,360
offline on our own internal chat tools

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
and that we present a unified strategy

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
or approach

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
to any of our contributors coming to the

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,559
open source side as well

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
too and then the other one was

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
remembering that negative feedback is

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
not failure

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,039
actually any feedback we get is is a win

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,880
in the product world

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,039
we're able to learn more about how our

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
users interact and work with our product

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,520
and be able to act

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,000
upon that information so i think that's

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,679
another thing

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
too where you look at the differences

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,640
between traditional development and

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,080
doing like more of an open source

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
product development

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
those issues and problems and bugs are

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,559
going to be a lot more in your team's

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
face

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,159
and you need to make sure that you have

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,559
the right kind of mindset and process

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
and just positivity to be able to handle

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,919
that

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,480
one example that we had for our product

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,720
was

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
after our initial launch we had done you

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,559
know a series of small improvements

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
things we needed to work on at some

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,520
point in that process a bug was

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,120
introduced

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,760
and our team had missed it throughout

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,840
our testing and somebody had commented

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,279
on and actually created an issue on

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
github and they had said hey

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
this is this is a problem for me this

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,960
broke and the team

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,480
immediately was like oh we we failed we

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
we didn't you know we didn't succeed and

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,120
it's like no

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
you actually were able to get the

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
feedback early that something wasn't

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
working

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,679
and now we were able to fix it and move

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,960
forward um so that's just the benefits

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
it's almost like a double-edged sword a

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
benefit

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,559
of open source is that you're going to

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,919
have more visibility into that

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
information you'll be able to get it

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
quicker

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
you just have to be able to understand

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,640
how do we handle it and move forward and

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,320
treat

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,399
that as a success and a chance to learn

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,000
and then finally embracing devops was

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,440
the other um

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,760
other piece that i think has been really

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,399
critical to our team success so looking

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
at

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,039
from a cultural perspective making sure

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,200
we do small but frequent updates

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,399
building in automation where it makes

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,799
sense

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,240
looking at opportunities to have better

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,039
insight into our system

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,520
and bring some of those dashboards and

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,039
insight

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,679
automation all the good things that come

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,720
with devops forward into our product and

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,320
then also releasing

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,320
some of that functionality too for some

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,399
of our end users that were interested

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,559
in actually kind of deploying deploying

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,919
the system overall

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,440
and so kind of like i mentioned going

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,720
back to one of the previous topics as

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,399
well too

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,799
we decided to actually release uh

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,840
do all of our documentation automated so

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
that you could just

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,440
at any point if there was any problem

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,080
you can update the docs

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,919
site redeploys itself super super simple

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,080
so trying to make sure that we can

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,000
keep all of our end user information up

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,600
to date and working without putting too

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
much stress on the team to be able to do

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,039
that and then automated releases are

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,640
another good one too

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,720
where you can definitely leverage a lot

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,840
of the benefits and tooling there

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,159
because as your product continues to

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,679
gain more users you know sometimes

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,640
you're going to find as it grows kind of

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,080
grows over that product life cycle curve

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
things are going to change your market

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,360
problem might change your target

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
audience might change a little bit

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,120
how do you develop your system in a way

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
that the automation can be smart and

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,600
then

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,200
adjust to that and be able to still

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,679
serve you as your product grows and

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
changes

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
all right so bringing it back i'll kind

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,399
of go back to the beginning just a

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,360
little bit

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,440
so one of the main reasons why or how

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,200
you can maximize your product's input

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,440
or your product's impact is by

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,960
leveraging the benefits of open source

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,039
in combination with product management

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,880
best practices so really working

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,799
to build up that community where you can

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,279
get the continuous feedback

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,960
you can learn more understand your users

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,799
and then keep building your product in a

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,600
way that it can continue to evolve

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,039
and adjust with that new information

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
designing outside in

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,399
one of the things we talked about making

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,360
sure you have organizational support and

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,919
alignment

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,559
for an open source of product initiative

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,960
and then

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,960
making sure that you have a strong

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
opportunity that you're actually chasing

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,679
and really the main way that this is

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,360
going to drive more value for your

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,120
product is by building that community

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,960
and that feedback early on in your

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,320
process

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,159
the next one we talked about was

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,440
building smarter so end users are now

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,320
going to be part of your development

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
team

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,000
and how do you handle that how do you

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
make it easy to test

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,360
your product how do you make it easy to

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,919
deploy it understand the code

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,919
i'm thinking about what you're doing

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
very holistically and not just

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,440
from the features that end users use

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,760
perspective

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,520
and really the main how is this going to

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
help impact your product and drive drive

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,399
value

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,279
it's going to help encourage a high

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,200
quality

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,440
flexible implementation that you can

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,960
keep adding and adjusting things to as

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,960
your community grows and changes

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,399
and then finally launching prepared so

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,679
we talked a little bit about having an

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,000
open source strategy

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,120
making sure you check the right boxes on

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,159
compliance legal

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,159
ip providing strong documentation and

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
really how this maximizes your impact is

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,320
you're going to jump start your

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,279
community you're going to get people

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
interested

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,399
passionate about what you're doing and

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,399
hopefully convert them into long

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,000
long time users of your product where

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,080
you can continue to pull on them for

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,600
that that feedback that insight

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,880
as it grows and evolves you really want

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,080
to make sure that you're capturing

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,840
people on that

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,360
on that first visit into your your

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,399
github repository and making sure

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,279
they're interested and they can

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,640
understand everything that's going on

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
so those were the three items that we

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
talked about kind of throughout the

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,200
process

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,440
as we designed our open source approach

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,600
built it and then launched it

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,559
and then finally moving forward so some

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,320
of the things we talked about we're

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,120
establishing communication boundaries

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,080
making sure

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,919
that people unders the team understands

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,440
where they can have discord and how they

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,080
can present a strong

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
a unified strategy to their community

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,120
remembering that all feedback is welcome

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,279
and encouraged

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,600
and a chance to learn building in the

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,120
right processes and ways to take in

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,200
those bugs and then

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,799
make the fixes release them ask for help

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
from the community those are all things

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,559
you're going to need to be successful

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,640
going forward and then embracing devops

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,320
looking at opportunities where you can

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,519
bring in more tooling

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,360
more automation having a culture uh with

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,279
ops in mind as you're building out some

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,880
of these new features how do we support

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,559
them how do we make sure that we're

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,399
building something that

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,480
we can support within our own company

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,640
but also make sure that other people

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,399
can also take and support within their

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
own company and be successful

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,360
on what they're doing over there so

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,320
always looking for opportunities to

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,159
improve

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,840
that culture and then looking at small

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,480
but frequent updates was the main thing

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,519
on that one as well too

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
all right so that's what i had for

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,279
content i wanted to switch it over to

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,799
chat and see if anybody has any

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,000
questions

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,279
hope this was helpful thank you so much

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:56,799
yeah thank you very soon um

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:59,919
we have one question in the q a

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,919
i'm gonna read that for you

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,960
so switch building blocks and licensing

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,720
did you use aws and gpl

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,480
and you did not open source all of your

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
code correct

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
awesome yeah so that's a good question i

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,840
think we went with um

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,519
i must say it's just a generic like

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,960
apache open source license

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,960
um so we have as far as looking at the

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,480
cloud providers that we use um the

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,039
scenario that i talked about today

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,120
with uh open source was definitely more

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,519
on the aws side

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,320
but yes as part of doing this this

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,720
product and

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,840
going with an open source route we did

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,679
not release all of

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,000
our code and i think some of that some

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
of the code that we chose not to release

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
was things that were more kind of

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,360
internal to our company so

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,200
we have this product that we've released

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
you know the core functionality

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,159
open source but we apply extra kind of

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,720
security controls and policies on top of

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,039
it

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,760
in our own internal uh corporate

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,039
environment

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
so those were some of the things that we

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,559
had taken out as far as

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,080
we don't want to let people in on

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,440
information as far as you know how we're

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,280
securing our environment what what

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,320
policies do we apply

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,159
we also do a corporate chargeback as

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,079
part of the process as well too

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,679
where we can actually charge back to

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,960
individual departments for their

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,040
utilization

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,800
and that was something that we didn't

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,720
really get a lot of interest from as we

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,560
were doing kind of that market analysis

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,159
and so we chose to kind of keep a lot of

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
that functionality in our internal

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,200
implementation as well too because folks

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
really weren't asking for it and it kind

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,800
of revealed a little bit more on how we

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,879
we do some of that processing behind the

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,320
scenes to our company um so yeah that's

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,440
a really really big area that you'll

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
want to consider if

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,560
this is a route that you want to take

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,159
where do you draw the line between

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,159
public information and not public

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,399
information

00:34:49,440 --> 00:35:03,839
awesome we still have some more time for

00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:03,839
any new questions

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,240
i really liked your target it was very

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,880
good

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,480
very basic very well in sequence and the

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,400
slides were really

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,079
really good so awesome thank you

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,000
yeah i know it was a it was a really fun

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,599
experience it was really cool to see um

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
you know what teams can do when you give

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,359
them the power to

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
open source and work on things uh

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,640
publicly as well so kind of kind of cool

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,839
to see the benefit internally and

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,839
on what looks like

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,480
um well we have some time too if there

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,079
aren't any other questions um

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,839
kind of curious for some of the folks

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
that answered yes they were able to move

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,760
forward

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
what did that look like so brent wants

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,960
to ask

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,880
did the management have issues with

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,839
losing competitiveness to signal

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,839
agencies

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,599
um losing competitive to

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,599
similar agencies

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,920
um could you clarify that one a little

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,200
bit

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,200
um not totally sure what

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,800
can you hear me oh yeah um

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,320
giving your your solution away could be

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,320
a competitive uh

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,079
loss um to to others that might be

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,359
using that um so i didn't know if there

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
was any objections that you had to

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640
overcome

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
when starting this project oh okay

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,359
gotcha yeah yeah no

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,520
um absolutely that was one that

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,359
uh came up quite a bit and where we

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,400
ended up determining you know based on

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,440
what we were doing

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,720
uh being able to get kind of that

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,079
feedback and community

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,640
from the public was a bigger a bigger

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
win

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,960
than the risk of sharing what we were

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,520
doing publicly so i think

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,040
you know as we think about options for

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,560
commercialization you know how would you

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,839
actually take this product and make it

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
something that you could sell and

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,599
promote

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
we had you know we had looked at other

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,440
areas where

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
you know maybe it's the corporate

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
chargeback some of those things that

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,880
were really specific to our company

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,400
maybe would be an opportunity for more

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,640
competit you know being competitive in

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,560
the future with like a paid offering

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,640
but we really tried to focus in as much

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,359
as we could on the functionality that

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
was

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,960
widely requested in our market analysis

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,480
and just building that out

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,119
and getting the feedback there ended up

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,440
being a lot a lot more of a win than i

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,359
think

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,680
the concerns that people had behind the

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,680
scenes

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,839
cool thanks yeah

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:33,839
so we have a couple of more minutes if

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:33,839
anyone has any last set of questions

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,280
minnesota so kind of the uh

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,000
twin cities area yeah it's been snowing

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,960
all day

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,880
steadily i've been hardly enough

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,880
oh okay nice

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,240
how's the weather over there

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,640
yeah so did he ask how is how is

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,599
everything here oh yeah yeah how's the

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,440
weather over there we're in the

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,400
snowstorm here in the midwest yeah well

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,920
you know we're we're just it's starting

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,320
cooler now

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,119
we are seeing fall it's definitely

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,320
better than before

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,359
we can go out and spend some good time

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,599
outside

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,359
the lake on beach i'm on the nc state

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,599
campus

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,599
um

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,599
good good area with good lakes and

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:37,200
trails and we have mountains

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,920
um it is a fall season so uh

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,560
definitely have to get on the mountains

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
for

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,400
to see the colors uh maybe close to the

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,839
blue ridge

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,839
british park asheville

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,680
oh very cool yeah um where we're at here

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,599
in minnesota if you go

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,599
along the north shore by lake superior

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,920
same kind of thing fall colors were

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,079
gorgeous probably buried now under snow

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,560
but

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,560
definitely here

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,839
yes all the sessions are getting

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,599
recorded

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,079
not sure when it's going to be available

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,680
or maybe just after this

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,839
