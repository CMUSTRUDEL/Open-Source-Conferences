Abstract: Open Source and standards have both long been mainstays of technology and software development.  They have also sometimes shared an adversarial relationship, despite the fact that both are important for different reasons to software developers and business executives.  At the heart of the conflict is generally the ‘speed of execution’ challenge. Standards bodies prefer to have everything mapped out cleanly to ensure interoperability testing works with different implementations. Open source projects prefer to define interoperability at the API level and move quickly with multiple iterations of the code.

However, industry efforts such as the Open Interconnect Framework and Open Cybersecurity Alliance (to name two) have realized that having both a standard definition and an open source reference implementation bring together the best of both worlds.  Additionally, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) like OASIS Open are increasingly paving the way to demystify open source for procurement environments that require or rely on standards (such as government, NGOs, and heavily regulated industries like financial services) by giving open source projects an easier path toward standardization.

This talk will describe the landscape of how open source and standards are currently working together but will also explore potential partnerships and other collaborative opportunities which are critically important in a world dealing with COVID-19.  This shared crisis presents once-in-a-generation opportunities for standards and open source communities to help define and build the future of emergency management, e-learning, medical technologies and many other aspects of our daily lives.  Determining how these elements work together effectively will be paramount to our common future.

	00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
so welcome everybody

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm guy martin i'm the executive

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,840
director at oasis open and we're an

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
international consortium that helps

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
organizations build great open standards

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,279
efforts

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
and more recently open source projects

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,000
i'm very new here i'm entering my

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,600
seventh month on the job

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
and my goal has been to bring the

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
experience uh from open source

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,279
communities which is where my background

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,760
is

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
into the organization and marry it with

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
what is the tremendous reputation and

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,239
experience

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
that we have at oasis in the standard

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,200
world and what i'd like to talk to you

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
all today about

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,640
is finding ways to bring the best of

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
open source and standards together in

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,840
support of the greater public good

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,840
so with that let's get started

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
so we have to kind of acknowledge it

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
let's face it 2020 has been a really

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,160
really tough year for all of us

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
um and i'd like to actually start with

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,399
this challenging example for a reason i

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
think

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
it it's really actually very valuable to

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,320
illustrate the importance of open source

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
and open standards

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,439
it's probably also not an example you'd

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,080
think of when you're considering

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,799
software technology code or or standards

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
in 2020 alone the western united states

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
primarily california where i used to

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
live

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
oregon where i live now in colorado

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
experienced

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
um over 8 400 wildland fires which

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
burned

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,400
5 million acres resulting in you know a

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
lot of homes 9 500 homes probably more

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
than that lost

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
and unfortunately as of this

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
presentation 41 live lost

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
i think we can all agree really clearly

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,479
these are grim statistics

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
but in the face of this tremendous

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,560
tragedy i think there are some great

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,479
examples

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
of the incredible resilience

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,600
determination

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
and great use of technology and

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
standards

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,119
before moving to oregon two years ago i

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
had the honor to serve the citizens of

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
california for 10 years as a cal fire

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
volunteer

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
and in this time i helped build our

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
volunteer communication staff

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
where we were responsible for deploying

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
our communications command post vehicle

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
to wildland fire incidents

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,879
and i learned some important things

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,920
during this experience because fire

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,760
agencies

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,440
band together to fight these kinds of

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,120
large wildfires

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
multiple agencies would often fill up

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
with the same incident

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
now the good thing is we were able to

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
rely on the apco p25

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
digital radio standard to communicate

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,000
efficiently and provide

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
safety critical information quickly

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
which allowed our firefighters to do

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
their job

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
protecting life and property however as

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,720
these myriad fire agencies came together

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
often they brought radios from different

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,120
manufacturers which presented an issue

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,239
when these agencies needed to have us

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
reprogram

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
large sets of radio frequencies and if

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
you've ever been to a wildland fire

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,080
command post the amount of frequencies

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,959
that are in use on on fires the size is

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
tremendous

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
and we had to reprogram all of these

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
radios that were brought in

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,360
so that these fire agencies could talk

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
to each other using this p25 standard

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
however because there was no standard

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
for writing radio data to different

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,920
radios

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
other than just serial communication

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,040
each manufacturer had written their own

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
proprietary software

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
which slowed the process of programming

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
and cloning these radios often we had to

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
have several laptops or

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
if we only had one laptop we'd have to

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
switch between software programs

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
potentially deal with

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
with serial contention and all sorts of

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,799
issues that really were

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,959
quite problematic if the manufacturers

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,200
had instead all contributed to an open

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
source implementation conforming to

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
a standard they could have easily

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
provided a critical tool

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,239
and shared the cost of developing that

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
software in short

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
in a situation like this there was

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
really no competitive advantage to be

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
gained from proprietary radio

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,400
programming software

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
and quite honestly many things to be

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,720
gained by standardizing

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,000
so the benefit of coherent standards and

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
the corresponding open source

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
implementations

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
is not unique to safety critical

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
situations like wildland fires

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
i believe there are many areas of our

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,519
lives that could significantly benefit

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
from better integration of standards and

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,080
open source

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
so though i primarily have experience in

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
the open source world

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
i also helped companies create open

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,759
source program offices

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,880
and strategies and i have some small

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
experience with working with

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
organizations like the open connectivity

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
framework which

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,960
was something that was developed to help

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,440
provide an abstraction layer for iot

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
networking standards i was i helped

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
start up that while i was at samsung

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,360
and this organization was one of my

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
first experiences with what i've come to

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
call the open development ecosystem

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,199
which is really being bringing the best

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,320
practices of open source

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,400
and open standards together however

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,520
despite my experiences with cal fire

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
and the ocf i wasn't always a convert to

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
standards

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
as a way to move technology forward

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,479
so you know i illustrate this i'd like

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,960
to acknowledge the elephant in the room

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
and uh from people in my open source

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
community

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
when i went to oasis this was kind of

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
the big elephant in the room

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,039
because it's how open source communities

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
today sometimes still view standards and

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,600
standards

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,280
organizations and really i think it's

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
about different perspectives

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
you know i'm sure we've all seen a

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
variation of this comic or heard people

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
talk about standards in this light

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
and i have to admit that early in my

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,160
career as an engineer

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
i mistakenly thought that open source

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
and working code was the only path

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
forward for everything

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
and i think there are still a lot of

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,759
people in the open source community that

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
unfortunately feel this way about

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
standards

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,759
and it's one of the reasons i wanted to

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
give this talk

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
because i believe education about the

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,720
role of open source and open standards

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,800
working together

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
is critical as we move forward as a

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
society in addressing

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,840
the ton of issues that are before us

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,840
that technology plays a role in

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
so rather than view open source and open

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
standards of adversaries

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,800
let's talk a little bit about how they

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
can come together to deliver better

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
outcomes

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,360
if you consider the historical

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
background you'll see that standards

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
activities came to live primarily with

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960
legal departments usually after there

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
was some patentable or valuable

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
intellectual property

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
bubbled up to them from the product or

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
engineering teams

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880
and open source software didn't always

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
make that same journey and sometimes the

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
iep around it

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,319
was deemed less important than the

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,960
outcome of actually building the code

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
that provided some functionality and you

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
know in doing research for my new role

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,840
here at oasis

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
what i realized is that the desired

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
outcome of both

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
open source and open standards

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
communities are the same

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
it's really for them about

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
interoperability choice

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,560
and innovation where these communities

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
differ

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,319
is in how they approach getting to these

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
outcomes and i think despite these

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,039
differences

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
they actually have great commonality and

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
what they're concerned about

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,919
usually issues of governance how use

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,599
cases are defined

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,240
and how they actually approach and get

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,199
to consensus

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,039
so in practice what what i found in my

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
my short time here at oasis is that

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,199
fast open standard group and i think

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,000
oasis is one that does exist that can

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,080
help

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,080
organizations create open standards in a

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
fairly rapid way

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
usually work really well with solid open

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
source projects that have a very good

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,319
idea

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,639
about their governance and sort of

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,919
understand how to how to actually move

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
things forward

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
and as a matter of fact the goal of the

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
open project program that we have here

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,479
at oasis is to help

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
bring together these two different kinds

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
of communities

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
because we believe that there's

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
tremendous value in both approaches both

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
the standards approach and the open

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
source

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
approach and we think that this is true

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,840
for both the technology creators

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
and the consumers of those technologies

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,919
as part of the goal of educating both of

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,800
these communities open source and open

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
standards

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,919
i think it's important to consider what

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,840
i call the hidden gems

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
of collaboration that have already been

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
happening with open source and open

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
standards for quite a while

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,120
you know code and standards have never

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,919
really been strangers for example

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
the internet engineering task force ietf

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,440
has been building networking standards

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
based on the notion of rough consensus

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,280
and running code for quite a while

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,039
our colleagues and friends at the open

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,479
source initiative osi

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
have created the open standards

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,039
requirement which is a list of criteria

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,080
for helping make open standards more

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,360
easily implemented as open source and at

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
oasis even before

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,039
our open projects initiative many of our

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
standard groups would create their own

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
open repositories on github or

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,880
way back in the day before github

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,360
existed on sourceforge

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
to provide sample code and or to provide

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
implementations for critical parts of

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,440
the standard

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,560
you know another area that oasis has

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
tried to help with

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,839
is in raising the bar on what we call

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,240
open standards

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,080
standards that are freely available and

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
you know contrary to popular belief

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
only a fourth of a percent of our

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
standards that have been issued over 25

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
years require royalties to be paid

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
and we think this is a great example and

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,120
this is something that we also believe

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
is really critical to breaking down that

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,000
barrier between

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,200
a specification and its implementation

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
you know that we think that the

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,760
synergies between open source and open

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,320
standards happen in one of three ways

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,839
sometimes the standard comfort as in in

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
the case of ubl

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,800
which is an open standard for electronic

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,720
uh invoicing widely adopted in europe

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
which genera generated many local

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
profiles in the different countries uh

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
in regions in europe

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
a lot of different regional public

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,200
projects and open source tools

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
and sometimes the code comes first so

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
this is an example that

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
hopefully a lot of you have heard of

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
star office building software which

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,120
enabled royalty free office document

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,519
spreadsheet and presentation software

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
this later then became the open document

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
format

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,160
and progressed from an oasis standard to

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
become an internationally recognized

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
standard with iso

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,320
sometimes these communities and these

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,200
efforts form in parallel

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
like in the mqtt standard or messaging

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
message queueing

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
telemetry transport well i can't say

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,120
that five times fast

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,360
which is a standard for an industry

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,959
protocol for lightweight iot sensor and

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
device coordination

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,279
and that was complemented and developed

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,560
alongside eclipse's open source project

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
like pajo

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,880
the nice thing is that as these develop

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
in parallel these two teams feed each

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
other improvements

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,320
and honestly this is what i saw with the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,399
open connectivity framework as well an

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,079
open source and open standard

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,079
that was feeding an open source

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,079
reference implementation and vice versa

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
one slideshow so

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,040
if you still don't believe in the

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,480
importance of the convergence of open

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,320
standards and open source

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
can you imagine today's world the world

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
we're living in right now without the

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
internet

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
in the face of the coven 19 pandemic the

00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,839
internet

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
and virtual communications have

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,600
literally become our window on the world

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
we're all having this conference right

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
now because of those technologies

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
and for those of us who are accustomed

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,839
to a commute our homes

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
have now also become our offices some

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,160
may say that's good or bad depending on

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
whether you have

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,959
kids like i do who are in in home school

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
most of us were used to shopping online

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,800
but now we're also shopping for

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,160
groceries and having them delivered to

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
our doorsteps

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
you know the majority of us have also

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
cut the cord with the convenience of

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
streaming entertainment services during

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
this time

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
we're meeting with our doctors directly

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
our children are attending school

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,079
vertically

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,360
and you know from tcpip to http

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,880
saml xml json and many others

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
none of this would have been possible

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
without the seamless integration of open

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,880
source and open standards

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,760
in short the internet's impact on our

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,160
daily lives

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,000
really has never been more profound

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,920
so i think we've established that open

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,240
source and open standards are critical

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,240
to each other for a lot of reasons

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,839
with that let's kind of explore the core

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
areas of open development

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,120
in preparation for looking at some

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
current projects that are making a big

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,279
difference in our world

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
using its open development ecosystem you

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
know

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
today's technologies our technologies

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,519
are more interdependent than ever

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
and de facto standards whether they're

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
open source projects or not

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
don't always give buyers the confidence

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,800
that the tech that they use

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,639
is going to be interoperable the

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,160
trade-off for the modularity in open

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
source is perhaps a lack of

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
wide interoperability which can

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,839
oftentimes drive up short

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,079
and long-term development costs and

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,760
interoperability

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
so the the standard side without

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,240
modularity is lock-in

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,880
a converged open development ecosystem

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
really gives

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,800
more voice to everyone and one of the

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
other big challenges

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
as you saw earlier in the in the coming

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,600
together slide

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
is finding a way to bridge the

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,440
intellectual property gap it's usually

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
the thing that comes up most often when

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,040
we talk about governance issues between

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
open source and open standards

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,120
and bringing a balance of protecting the

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
differentiated ip which is very

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
important for organizations that

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,720
you know are building technologies that

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
they want to use to differentiate

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
themselves

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,959
bringing the balance of protecting that

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,839
differentiated ip

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,920
while allowing and encourage encouraging

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
support for non-differentiated ip and

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,040
standards

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
so all of the things that you build your

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
that that are part of the core that

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
everyone

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
needs to use and shouldn't be developed

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
over and over again

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
and finding a way to to allow that code

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
to be really given

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,240
to important technology efforts whether

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
those efforts are source code or

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
specifications

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
uh there are some projects that i'm

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
going to talk about in a second that are

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,839
doing a great job i think of using

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
their major api interfaces as really the

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,399
bone for starting the specification work

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,720
and it's a great place to begin begin to

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,680
provide a convergence between the open

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,800
standards and the open source community

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,040
and finally it's really important to

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
provide good neutral guidance with all

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,320
the potential roadblocks

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,720
between these these communities and in

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
this world and this is a critical role

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
of open source and open standards

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:17,839
foundations and consortiums

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,839
like ourselves and oasis and others

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
so we talked about some of the

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
historical projects and i think

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
many of which continue to be the

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
underpinnings of our technology world

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,040
today

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
but let's turn our attention to some

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
newer projects that i think are

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
providing

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
examples of the proven ground that's

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,360
happening in open source and open

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
standards today

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,720
so the first one of these that i'd like

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,880
to cover is an oasis project called the

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,240
open cyber security alliance

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
which is really building an open

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
ecosystem where cyber security products

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,880
inter-operate without the need for

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,959
completely customized integrations

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
and as you can imagine from the the

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,199
window on the on the on the world slide

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
the world that we're living in today is

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,199
even more dependent on online tools so

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
cyber security takes on an especially

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,920
important and critical role

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
the efforts for the oca consists right

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,519
now of three projects

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,720
the sixth shifter project which is an

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
open source library

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,399
allowing software to connect to data

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,519
repositories and exchange threat

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,560
information

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,279
using the structured threat information

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
expression standard or sticks and stixx

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
is really a structured language for

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,079
describing cyber threat

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
information so that it can be fared

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,600
stored and analyzed in a consistent

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,639
manner

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,320
the open dxl ontology is a project

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,440
focused on the development of an

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,399
open and interoperable interoperable i

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
shouldn't have had more coffee this

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,519
morning

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,160
international cyber security messaging

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
standard

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
for use with the opendxo messaging buff

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,639
and opendxl

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
provides an open source implementation

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
of the data exchange layer

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,800
which many vendors and enterprises

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,720
already utilize and it delivers a simple

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,320
open path for integrating security

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
technologies regardless of who the

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,680
vendor is

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,360
the last project is nist scap nist has

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,279
built a suite of specifications

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,160
for exchanging security automation

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,399
content which is used to do automated

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,160
configuration compliance and to detect

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,920
the presence of

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
vulnerable versions of software in your

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,040
stack and this same s-cap content

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,440
can be used by multiple tools to perform

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
autopsies automated security assessments

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,079
the ota project is developing a proof of

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
concept code for the s-cap effort

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,759
i think what's interesting is all these

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,759
efforts are combining specifications

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,600
with open source implementations to

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
allow more seamless sharing of this

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,920
critical cyber threat

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
security information

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
the next project i'd like to talk about

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,959
is the baseline protocol

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
also when an oasis open project and it's

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,320
an open source

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
initiative that combines advances in

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,519
cryptography

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,759
messaging and blockchain to deliver

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,160
secure and private business processes

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
at a low cost over the public ethereum

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,959
mainnet

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,480
however the nice thing about about

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,319
blockchain is that it also can be

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,079
potentially used on other distributed

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,640
ledger technologies to help provide

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,319
secure verification of those blockchain

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
transactions without having to know a

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,679
lot about what's in the

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,120
what's in the individual systems that

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,400
are kind of in each

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,760
each entity's

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,919
infrastructure the protocol

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,039
enables confidential and complex

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
collaboration between

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,360
between enterprises without leaving any

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,880
sensitive data on pain so this is a very

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,799
very important thing

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,240
and baseline is doing is one of the

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,640
projects that i think is doing a great

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,200
job of using their api references as the

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,039
bones or basis for their specification

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
and this allows them to have separate

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,120
but cooperating communities

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,360
to feedback critical contributions to

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
each other

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
and an interesting note in our current

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,640
covid crisis is that baseline

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,559
has been meeting with the mobile

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,720
industry in an attempt to help make

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,240
contact tracing apis and functionality

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,840
more private and secure

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,840
by using this baseline protocol

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,520
and baseline i think is a really really

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,480
great example of one of the first oasis

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
open projects

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
that's taking advantage of processes

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
that we've helped develop

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,799
to help guide open source developers

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
into easily creating specifications that

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,200
are useful

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
outside of the initial open source

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
implementation

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,280
the slides keep slipping back okay

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
the third project i'd like to talk about

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
is the open services for life cycle

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,039
collaboration or oslp

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
this is the community that's striving to

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,919
pull together a lot of diverse

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,400
initiatives focused around

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,919
application integration solutions that

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,240
allow you to collaborate and partner

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,840
with each other rather than compete

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,679
there are many many organizations with

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,200
different backgrounds that are sharing

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,039
their version of what an integrated

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
engineering environment looks like

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
and sometimes they're promoting

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,640
different approaches than what oslc

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
and the and other linked data solutions

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
provide but i think the goal of this

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,760
community is to

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
openly discuss complementary approaches

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,200
which can also be appropriate

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,720
to the goal of improving the overall

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,160
viability of standards and

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
implementations

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
for supporting these industries

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,960
engineering industry integration

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,559
challenges

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,559
this project combines a set of open

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,280
source libraries that allow the

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
interchange of information like iop

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,799
systems

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,640
plm or product life cycle management 3d

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
data and other data sources

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
with some corresponding specifications

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
that allow for greater interoperability

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,520
and testing in this world

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,360
and there are a lot of different

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,600
companies that have already implemented

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
significant parts of oslc

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
into their products and up operations

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
including

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,160
honda so so daimler

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,080
att and ravelbank and we're actually

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
really happy to say that at oasis this

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
is one of the first open

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,039
um one of our open projects efforts

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,080
that's actually gone from code

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,760
to actual project specifications so it's

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,600
a great example of of

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,600
how that process has worked and how

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,919
we're working to continue to

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
bridge that gap between open source

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
efforts

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,679
and standard effort

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
so while there's already great work

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
going on in this convergence between

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,919
open source and standards

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,400
based on the examples i've shown i'd

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,200
like to turn our attention a bit

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,840
excuse me the opportunities are still

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,840
out there

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
for the open development ecosystem

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,960
so i think this pandemic has really

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,720
changed everything

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,559
from the way we approach our day-to-day

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
life to how we look at our future as a

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,760
society

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,480
and honestly there's never been a better

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,440
time for a closer synergy between the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
public sector

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
and the private sector in creating

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,559
technologies for the greater public good

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,480
worldwide

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,000
i think there's still plenty of room for

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
differentiated and proprietary

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
technology

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
however creating silos of information

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
that lock away

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,880
critical data base for things like

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
pandemic response or life safety data or

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,600
other things

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,159
it's simply not sustainable for us as a

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
society going forward

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,679
governments and the technology sector

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
can oftentimes have an uneasy

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,559
relationship

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
where mutual trust is a hard thing to

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,679
come by

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
you know it's in this context that

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,960
international standards and open source

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,039
organizations also need to step up

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
and partner with each other and the

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,440
public sector and tech sector

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
so organizations like apache ourselves

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,640
at oasis open

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,480
ieee sao open the ietf hl7 which is a

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,520
health standards organization

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,760
and the iso provide these neutral forums

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,240
and guidance that help achieve agreement

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,960
on critical on supercritical technology

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,440
for our society

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
specifically partnerships between all of

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,760
these groups

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
should be used to bootstrap new

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,120
collaborations that drive not only value

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,440
but also increase the common good

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,200
so now let's take a look at some areas

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,640
where this could be prioritized

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,840
based on our current situation with

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,840
covet and the future challenges that we

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
face

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,200
so obviously based on my first slide in

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,960
my description you should

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
probably have figured that emergency

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
response was going to be one of the ones

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
that i highlighted

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
i think it's a critically important area

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
that we need to continue to invest in

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,679
both in standards and open source

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,120
implementations

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
there's already great work going on here

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,559
at oasis and in other places

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,880
but specifically at oasis and our

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,559
emergency management technical committee

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,159
which is the home of cap the common

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
alerting protocol so if you've ever

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,840
gotten a weather alert if you've ever

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
gotten an amber alert in the u.s for

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,960
mystic child

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
the underlying technology and standard

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,760
for that is cap the common alerting

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
protocol

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
but there's also work going on for

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,799
things like hospital availability how

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
many beds are available in a current

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,799
regional hospital and other related

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,919
standards in this area

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,760
additionally the as4 oasis standard is

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,799
currently being used in europe today to

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,880
help build covet 19 data exchanges so

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,559
these are really really important things

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
that need to be addressed

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,360
however even these great open standards

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,360
need good open source implementations

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,720
and i think this is an area where public

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
and private partnerships have

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,000
traditionally not been as strong

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,320
and it would be great to see this

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,200
flourish going forward as we start to

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
think about

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
what our ongoing response to future

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
pandemics and future crisis

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
might be

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,080
yeah slides are just jumpy today

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,919
as a parent this one is near and dear to

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,960
my heart and probably to many of you as

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
well

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,279
i think really we're it we're definitely

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,799
an infancy of this area right now and

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,640
you know i think we've done a great job

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
adapting as a society and as a

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,159
technology sector

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,520
with technologies like zoom or google me

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,880
or google classroom

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
but they've kind of all been cobbled

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,159
together it hasn't been a seamless

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
experience and and i know i'm probably

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,200
not the only parent that's seen

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,120
seeing this has not been a seamless

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
experience and you know i'm very

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,400
fortunate that i work in tech and have

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
been an engineer for most of my career

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
so i've been able to help

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,520
help my kids with this but i can't

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
imagine what this is like for the

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,480
average parent that

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,240
it probably doesn't have a huge amount

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,400
of technology experience

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
so figuring out how we build better

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,880
standards to do things like

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,240
exchange exchange assignment data

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
coordinate schedules and

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,840
you know we have calendar standards but

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
being able to actually utilize those in

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,279
a consistent way to coordinate

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,440
uh school schedules i think is going to

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,679
be really really important going forward

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,760
um providing reliable and integrated

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,679
teleconferencing so not just zoom

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,960
coupled together with other things but

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
really finding a way

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,400
to build an integrated set of standards

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,640
and platforms

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
to actually make remote learning viable

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
for everybody

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
is going to be critical going forward

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,039
and i think

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,919
even after our students are are able to

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,679
go back to in-person learning

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,200
this is a critical moment where it's

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,720
important for us to consider what

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
education is going to look like in the

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,600
future

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,799
i think the silver lining that covid has

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
given us is an

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,480
opportunity to reimagine what education

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
can look like

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
and it could be a combination of imports

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,320
and time with the flexibility of remote

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,360
learning for some subjects or segments

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,880
that don't require in-person attendance

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
i think it's safe to say this will not

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,400
be the last pandemic or medical

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,159
emergency our world is going to face

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
i think now is the time to start

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,840
building standards

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
and open source implementations that we

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,679
can build additional functionality on

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,360
and even if that means proprietary

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,799
add-ons that are interoperable and

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,240
correspond to a standard

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,880
i think it's really really important

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,840
that we do this to further safeguard

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,840
our children and our society

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,200
so if the storms and wildfires have

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,960
taught us one thing

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
it's that climate change is a situation

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
we need to deal with

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
however i think far from just being the

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,640
morally right thing to do

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,720
this is this presents again like the

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,880
remote learning a unique opportunity to

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,880
reimagine what our economy and our world

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440
can look like longer term

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,120
so things like the un's green economy

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
program or the european commission's

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,960
green and circular economy

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,799
are going to require technological

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
investments at both the standard and

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,679
open source levels

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
and there's already some promising

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,159
efforts underway in areas like the linux

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
foundation's elf energy effort which

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
helps with control

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
automation virtualization and the

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,360
orchestration of supply and demand in

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,120
the energy grid

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,960
and while tackling this from the code

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,559
first perspective is good

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,480
i think there's clearly long-term

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,440
benefit to building the associated

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,600
standards

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,000
that can work with the energy and and

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,840
other sections of the green economy

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,840
and taking all these projects that are

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,600
currently being housed in places like

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,520
elf energy and also helping build

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,760
standards around them

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,520
so other areas of the green economy that

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,360
we need to be looking at include

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,120
things like waste to energy and

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
recycling management

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,559
sustainable urban development and

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
transportation and i'll point out here

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,159
that that there is a project

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,840
or an effort going on within oasis one

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,120
of our foundation as a service effort

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,279
called the open mobility

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,640
framework or omf and i think it's a

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
really really interesting way to

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,279
reimagine what

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,279
urban development and transportation

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,480
looks like as we support the greening

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,480
economy

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,760
and also energy efficient construction

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,480
ecological building

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,399
is a growing market prior to oasis i was

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,320
at autodesk which is doing a lot of work

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,080
towards figuring out how to make

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,640
buildings more energy efficient and how

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,159
to make planning for whole

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,279
cities and and whole um urban areas a

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,480
lot more efficient

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,360
and a lot more green there's a lot to do

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,120
in this space

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,880
and i think it's critically important

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,000
that we find creative ways to partner

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,399
with all the stakeholders

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
again i think partnerships are a huge

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,200
part of this

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:16,159
partnering with all the stakeholders to

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:17,840
make this happen for our future

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,360
so as i close today and we're going to

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,720
have plenty of time for questions which

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,000
i i like

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
i'd like to leave you with some points

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,559
to consider for how we can all move the

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
needle

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,760
on the convergence between open source

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,360
and open standards

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,279
i think there are four areas that are

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
critical as we move forward

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,200
the first one is education it's

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
important to continue to shine the light

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,159
on the great work

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,240
already being done in efforts to combine

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
open source and open standards

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,720
we need to educate people about the

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
value of open source and open standards

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,840
working together

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
we need to educate consumers i think

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,080
especially in government

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,039
about how to properly shop for solutions

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,840
that offer both

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,159
good standards and open implementations

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,679
and to help demystify open source

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,279
in these really highly regulated

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,799
procurement pipelines i mean there's a

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,919
lot of great work going on in government

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,480
and open source

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,520
much more than in the time that i helped

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,520
start the forged

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
mill effort in the department of defense

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,320
there's i was just

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,720
seeing today that the nsa sponsor of ato

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,159
has code.nsa.gov so they're doing some

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
great work in open source

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,679
we need to continue to demystify open

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,600
source in these highly regulated

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,840
procurement pipelines

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,760
we need to educate businesses and

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,399
developers to consider building

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,600
both an open standard and an open source

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,840
implementation when it's appropriate

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
collaboration is the next one and we

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,039
just need to make it easier for

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,320
standards and open source communities to

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,440
collaborate and this is

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,120
not just in sharing code and ideas or

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
asynchronous communication but in

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,200
providing real guidance around

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,640
intellectual property process and

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
governance practices

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
that allow both communities and their

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,120
users to reap the benefits

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
of the great minds of both open source

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,039
and open standards

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,559
the next one is partnerships and some

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,880
may say hmm partnerships and

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,480
collaborations look like the same thing

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
but in this case i think it's about

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,799
bringing together the stakeholders that

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,720
i mentioned earlier

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
the public sector and the private sector

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
in partnerships with foundations and

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,919
consortiums

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,520
like oasis and others to help bootstrap

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,799
efforts that provide technology for the

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,279
public good

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,880
foundations and consortiums i think also

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,080
need to learn to

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
be a little bit better at partnering

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,679
with each other especially in areas

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,679
where we have complementary and not

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,520
competing technology agendas

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,120
and i'm happy to say that oasis actually

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,039
has great rep great

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,640
relationships with organizations like

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,159
hl7 and iso

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,080
and itu and i think it's one of the

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,159
reasons that i wanted to come here i saw

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,520
oasis as an organization that was taking

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,279
the partnership efforts

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,279
seriously and partnering to build

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,039
common guidance on these things i

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,480
mentioned process ip and governance

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,520
would be a great place to start

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,080
right so i think there's a lot of

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,000
expertise in in these these standards

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,559
and open source organizations

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
around these common areas of process ip

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,720
and governance and it's time for us to

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,799
partner

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
with each other to find ways of kind of

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,039
giving those

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,840
those guidance and that those areas of

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,640
help in a very common way

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
and lastly it's about impact i think we

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,240
all need to step back

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
and think about impact what's the impact

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,279
of the technology

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,399
business or implementation decisions

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,080
that we're making

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,240
are we making for exciting decisions

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,760
strictly in the name of profit

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,279
are we considering how we can balance

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
the need for shareholder value

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,440
with positive impact on society and i

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
know personally as a technologist and

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,399
leader

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,120
these are things i think about every day

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,039
understanding

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,960
our larger impact on society is going to

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,799
be critical going forward

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
you know i think open source has changed

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,120
the world in a lot of positive ways

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,640
and to continue to be effective it needs

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,640
to work at a whole new level in

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,320
cooperation with open standards

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,320
and you know while open standards has

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,000
clearly been the bedrock of technology

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
that we've all come to rely upon

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
including all the technologies we're

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,440
using to have this conference

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,039
the open standards needs to fully

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,279
embrace open source to push

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,640
better more interoperable solutions

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,480
forward

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
and i think with both sides with this

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,279
whole coin hopefully we can make a

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,840
lasting impact

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,840
on society's most critical issues

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,960
so with that thank you very much and i

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
am

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,000
happy to take questions

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,399
thank you guys it is such an interesting

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,000
talk thank you once again to be a part

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,600
of ato

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,279
um yeah we definitely have a good time

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,159
for questions

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,399
and i see in the chat a couple of

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,559
questions from lawrence

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,000
and then there's a question in the q a

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,519
so just following along

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,519
the uh sequence

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,039
let's go with what lawrence wants to ask

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,960
so do you want me to read the question

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,720
or should we allow lawrence to speak his

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,320
question

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
either one i i would love to have the

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,480
interaction with the audience if they're

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,679
happy to

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,679
want to speak with the question sure

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,919
hello hi laurence

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,360
um so i don't i let's pretend that my

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,080
camera's not working because that's not

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,080
working but

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,600
that's okay um the

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,600
so basically i was gonna

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,120
i want to talk about another time about

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,240
the

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,559
the your your pro your experience with

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,600
the

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,559
connectivity project because i'm

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,600
doing research on uh iot standards and

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,240
with the eclipse found

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,120
i talked to the clip eclipse foundation

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,720
uh last week

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,080
about their standards and linux

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,159
foundation and trying to figure out what

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,600
what the how that collaboration is

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,039
working out

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,039
but um the

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,880
what i guess my question is for all

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,720
those projects

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,559
in in uh for oasis open

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,559
are they all net new projects

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,240
oslc was one that we converted from one

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
of our tech technical committees or our

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,440
standards

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,119
side of the house and i know chetzin who

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,800
is our chief community standard

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,639
steward is actually here on the session

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,040
with us but i know we commuted we

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,800
converted oslc to an open project the

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,159
other two are net new

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,200
um yeah and then

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:31,919
two two similar questions is um

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,520
is os is oasis open a 501 c3

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,879
yeah and so yeah there's some confusion

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,240
there so we're actually in the middle of

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,159
a rebrand right now it's one of the

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,560
first things i did as we came on board

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,879
so

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,399
oasis and oasis open are the same thing

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,000
um we're actually going

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,040
forward to going to refer to ourselves

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,200
as oasis open uh we're a 501c6

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,119
so we're member driven so we've got

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,760
foundational sponsors like cripsoft and

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,520
ibm

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,040
and and google and others are not

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,520
google's not a foundational but

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,640
other organizations that basically pay

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,119
memberships

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,560
to help drive the open source and open

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,640
standards efforts

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,839
and then on the standard side i think it

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,079
were a little bit different than

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,599
maybe other uh seos and standards

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,200
definition orgs in that

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,720
all of our standards as i pointed out

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
with the exception of like a fourth of a

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,640
percent

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,839
um are royalty free so basically they're

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,359
the the the um money is paid up front by

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,240
members to help develop these standards

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,440
which are then

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,480
which are then royalty free and

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,520
available what standards organizations

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,760
which major standards organizations

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,480
collect royalties oh gosh i mean there's

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,079
there's

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,320
you know there's iso uh they but iso

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,440
really is about the payment for the uh

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
or the standard stock themselves um and

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,920
i think that

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,400
uh you know it's uh it's kind of

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,160
almost everybody else that we've seen um

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,000
you know has some form of

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,440
either payment for the for a copy of the

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,760
standard or or

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,880
depends on the the implementation um if

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
you want to pay for the implement

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
to be able to do the implementation i

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,040
think uh one of the things i saw

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,880
at oasis is that yeah because it really

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,160
is a very flexible organization will

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,520
allow will allow reasonable and

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
non-discriminatory or ran-based

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,400
standards but it's a very small

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,599
percentage of our portfolio

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,680
and uh and

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,040
you're you're creating foundations as a

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,119
service as an offering

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,560
is that correct yes we actually kind of

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,240
have three i didn't really want to talk

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
to i'm happy to talk about oasis i

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,960
didn't want to make it so much about

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,920
oasis and presentation but yeah we have

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,000
we have um

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,680
kind of three three major offerings or

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,880
four major offerings right now um

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,200
technical committees which is the

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,680
standard side open projects which is the

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
open

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,640
open source efforts and we're actually

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
in the future going to be merging those

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,640
two into kind of a combined

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,400
projects or projects what we're calling

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,240
product for projects offering

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,839
we also run technical advisory groups

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,079
when asked for iso so

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,680
for tags and then we have we have an

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,280
offering called foundations of service

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,880
which basically if you want to come in

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,640
and run a foundation

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,480
with your own charter and own rules you

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,200
can come in as a 501c6

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,480
uh sub foundation under our umbrella

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,720
let's see if someone else has

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,240
other questions because um as you can

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
tell i'm interested in this subject i

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,839
could talk more about it so yeah i'll

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
give someone else some more time

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,000
sure

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,839
sure thank you to lawrence um let's see

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,040
if we have one question in the q a

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,520
um quite a long question yeah

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,040
that's it the question is the licensing

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,119
question

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,119
yeah it's licensing question

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,680
oh boy

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,599
so i will say i'm reading the licensing

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,920
question and anonymous intended

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,040
i will i will start off with with my

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,240
standard disclaimer of i-a-i-a-n-a-l i

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,359
am not a lawyer

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,480
um with that being said i think

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,440
what's interesting is that um

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,880
you've got permissive uh sorry i'm sorry

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,160
roman i'll actually read the question

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,560
because you're right it didn't come up

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
um a burglar skis of an ip licensing is

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,400
permissive

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,680
open source licensing i i e mit

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,240
mit or bsd3 versus copy left open source

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,920
licensing dpl cc by sa

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,000
any thoughts on whether open standards

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,400
should go in the direction of permissive

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,240
copy left neither both or something else

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,760
for ip covered by the standard

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,560
and how does that affect participants

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,119
ability to develop differentiated ip

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,560
um this is a huge huge minefield and

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,640
unfortunately i don't have

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,880
uh jamie bark our general counsel on the

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,200
call but i will just say

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,960
that it's one of the areas that you

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,079
really have to think about right because

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,160
if you

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,400
if you allow permissive licensing or

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,880
copyleft licensing on a standard

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
then yeah you probably are going to get

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,960
a lot more um

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,200
maybe implementation or adoption of that

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,400
standard but at the risk

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,480
of of you know potentially having large

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,480
organizations not want to participate

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,160
because of that viral nature right i

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,119
mean we all we all love and appreciate

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,560
the gpl for for what it's done but um

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,760
you know it took i think

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,760
on the open source side and it took

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,520
organizations a long time to kind of get

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,280
asked some of the the the um

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,960
how do i say this some of the challenges

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,640
around gpl um

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,480
and you know linux kernel was one thing

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
but i know when i was at samsung we had

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,079
gpl

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
uh challenges around device drivers and

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,280
tablets for example

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
and and it was challenging for the

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,200
organization who's developing

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,079
that differentiated ip to kind of want

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
to do that so

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,720
i think you have to be really really

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
careful on the standard side because i

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,000
think if you

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,960
you do that you know you're going to

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
potentially

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,079
um diminish the number of large

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,079
organizations

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,000
that want to contribute to that standard

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,480
now at the same time you also have to

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,240
find a way to balance that i think it's

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,560
important so i'll give you an example

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,119
ocf the open connectivity framework

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,280
what we did in the licensing around the

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,280
the

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,920
brand standard there was say if you

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,400
each organization that's a member of ocf

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
as they're

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,599
going through the the standard

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,359
definition there was a period of time

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
where they could say and i think they

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,720
got one or two of these

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,319
a year where they could raise their

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,599
hands and say okay wait a minute that

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,319
reads on a patent

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,359
or ip that i have my organization has

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,640
and we're not comfortable with that

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,640
being in the standard

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,560
um and we kind of did that as a way to

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,839
give them an out to say hey

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,680
you know that's that that's what the

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,200
bridge people are per month for it from

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,920
an ip standpoint

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,960
but in reality uh i think that was that

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
that clause was used

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,000
once in the time that i worked in ocf

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,680
which was a which was a couple of years

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
we had one organization say hey that's

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
just a

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,800
there's some patentable ip in there that

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
we're not comfortable with being in the

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,839
standard

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,359
but you know i think for the most part

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,800
when you when the organizations come

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,520
together for the right reasons to build

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,359
the standard

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,520
they're hopefully building a standard

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,599
that that they're going to provide

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
additional differentiated ip on top of

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,720
so

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,520
the the licensing of that standard

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,960
itself

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:03,920
you know probably should be um

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,920
not not not on the permissive side

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,440
hopefully that answers the question

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,560
without getting in too much trouble

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,319
about the fact that i'm not a lawyer

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,240
yeah maybe yeah thank you

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,839
um let's see if you have any more

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,839
questions and see any more questions

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
though

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,640
yeah any any other questions or comments

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,560
happy to

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,480
talk about this and and lawrence we can

excuse me if you want to have a larger

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,560
discussion about this

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,280
okay well awesome thank you everybody

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,319
