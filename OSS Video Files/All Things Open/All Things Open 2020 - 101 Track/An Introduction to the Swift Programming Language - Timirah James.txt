Abstract: Swift has been on every tech publication’s “Top 10 Languages to Learn” list for five of it’s six-year lifespan. Why is this? Swift has proven its potency well beyond the mobile (iOS) community as its range of capabilities continue to grow via the open source community, emerging into realms like Machine Learning and serverless. 

In this introduction to Swift, we’ll look into the basics of the language and demystify the reasons behind Swift’s increasing popularity in 2020 and beyond.

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
my name is

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,639
tamara james and uh i will be your

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
speaker today i am

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,320
a tech evangelist and founder of

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,680
technical a

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,160
um and i'm really really excited to

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
uh speak to you about the swift

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
programming language

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
uh because this is something that is

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,760
definitely on the rise

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
um and swift is a language that has

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
soared

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
uh beyond its youth um

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
and really has kind of taken over um

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
and spread out into a lot of different

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,280
things so i'm here to demystify

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,800
uh the swift's programming language for

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
you and help you decide

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,840
whether um help you kind of decide

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
whether oh

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,760
excuse me i'm giving a talk giving a

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,760
talk yes i'm giving a talk

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,800
sorry virtual um

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
yes and help you kind of decide uh

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,240
whether

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
swift the swift languages is right for

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
you

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,640
okay so um

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
let's go ahead and jump right in

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,840
so 2014

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,840
swift was born uh swift

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
it was it was definitely all the rage

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,079
when it first came out if you can

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
remember um and this is why i like to

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,520
say oh swift is kind of like

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
beyonce it was just like it kind of just

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,159
soared right

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,799
um in in popularity everyone when it

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
came out

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,479
everyone kind of flocked to it and there

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
were so many reasons why

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,399
for one it was really really appealing

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,880
to

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,439
beginners right uh people who were

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,719
just coming into programming and then

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,079
people who were also

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,200
just jumping into swift from the

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
objective c side

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
and for those of you who are not

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,239
familiar with objective c objective c

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,280
is basically swift's uh excuse me

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,760
swifts um yeah swift's

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,879
what do you call it predecessor i think

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
i'm saying it right

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,400
you know what i mean it's it was the

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,400
language that came before

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,000
right uh and objective c

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,760
was the language uh the soul language

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
that uh apple had created for developers

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,080
to

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,599
build um you know apple products and

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
um apple uh based applications for the

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,920
apple platform

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,280
objective c was the um sole language for

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,920
about

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,599
a good three decades straight so here

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,680
comes swift

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,599
and then immediately you start to see

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,680
these differences in simplicity

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,560
right the main thing was the simplicity

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
um and so as you can see like something

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
as simple as initializing something

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
right

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
um you have these arrows and you have

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
these extra like brackets and then you

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,760
have to

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,200
um you know you have to intentionally

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,080
excuse me intentionally like allocate um

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,519
you know your your your memory uh like

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
you you have to do all of these things

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
when you're initializing as opposed to

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
in swift you can do this you

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
swift kind of does this all for you

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,440
right and it's very very

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,720
uh simplified

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,159
another thing was um

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
again more into the catchy syntax

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
um and not just for people coming from

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,200
the apple realm right who are already

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
familiar with

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,480
c was catching for um most programmers

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
so people coming from

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,400
the javascript side people coming from

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,000
python people coming from c

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,920
plus plus um and

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
you know even down to like the the var

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,120
keywords and there's a lot of different

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,560
similarities

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,480
when it comes to um these languages so

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,319
people were coming from these languages

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,680
they were um really really interested

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,920
you know and they were they were really

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
intrigued to kind of see what what all

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,600
this swift hype and rage was about right

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
because if you can remember

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
all the publications were talking about

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,120
it um all the developer communities the

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
blogs everybody was talking about this

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
new found language right but there was

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,600
only for

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
uh it was only set for mobile

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,040
development or a development on

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
the apple platform so the fact that all

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,199
these other developers were kind of

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,199
side eyeing it like oh okay um it kind

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,320
of made it attractive to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,520
try it out right um even if it

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,040
meant you know you you are you know a

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
front-end developer and you want to

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,360
probably tap into ios development or mac

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,320
os development right

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
um so the syntax was very much easier to

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,039
read because it was

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
catchy um and it's really important for

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
a new language

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,919
um there are no semicolons as we said

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
before you know excess square brackets

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,120
address for pointers

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,440
so on and so forth

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,639
this is a big one interoperability

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,759
um and this

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,759
is this is something that uh really was

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
a game changer when it came to the swift

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,639
programming language

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,000
um and what does this mean this means

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,960
that for example

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,280
like it like here you have a python

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,320
library you can simply import

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,560
any python library in swift

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
and it just works to compile so and

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,039
similarly you can do

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,320
um you can import uh c and c

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,440
plus plus libraries into swift as well

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,800
so yes if you need you know specific

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,080
functionality um but it's not

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,759
implemented in swift um you can you know

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,440
import corresponding like

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
python or c plus plus um or like a c

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,440
package

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
um and you can import um modules from

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,520
swift

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
uh and call python functions and convert

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
values between

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
um you know between those two languages

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,520
whether it's

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,840
uh swift and python or swift and c

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
plus so on and so forth

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,800
another thing is uh

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,600
it's a really really safe language

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,639
uh and what is what does this mean we'll

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
get into

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,199
the details just after this but it's

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,240
very very safe um in a sense

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,680
to the sense where it's very memory

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,280
um very very very uh memory

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,440
centered around memory right um and

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,720
it's something that really defines smith

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
as a language

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
uh so it prevents huge memory leaks

00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
which then

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,880
of course contributes to the fact that

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
it's performed so fast um as a language

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
which

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
again is something that pull people told

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,759
like okay this

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,039
compiler is really really powerful um

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,720
and yeah and that's because of how uh

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,000
memory driven uh and and

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,960
really hyper aware it is about uh

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,440
memory allocation um and preventing

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,319
those

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:34,240
memory leaks um that swift really is

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,280
a lot of that is due to uh optionals

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
um now optional is not anybody who has

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,440
taken a peek

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,639
at the swift language you notice this

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,039
right um so me coming from uh objective

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
c

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,720
you know an objective c background this

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
is something that throw me off a little

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
bit

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,759
right so we're like oh extra punch extra

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,199
punctuation and

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,360
code like okay um now i have to deal

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
with question marks and exclamation like

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
what does this even

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,520
mean right um and basically optionals

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,000
check for and protect values

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
when they're when they're compiling okay

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
um

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,400
so what does this mean okay so for

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,919
example let's say

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,080
you you're building um an instagram app

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,120
kind of instagram clone right you have a

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,280
username you have followers

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,960
um let's say you know you have a user

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,000
who um if if they have the application

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,080
nine times out of ten they have uh

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,599
a username right so you know that value

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
is always gonna be there

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,000
they may not have any followers okay

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
there are some accounts on there

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,440
um you know for those of us who have um

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
you know soccer accounts we're just like

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
okay

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
you're hiding behind the accounts right

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,880
um

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
we have those follower those that

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
follower number

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
that is not guaranteed right that is

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
something that we

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,720
we we're not gonna know the number and

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,000
and it could end up being nil

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,800
right um so that is something that value

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
for followers that question mark think

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,760
of it as like a force field right it's

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,760
protecting

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,120
that value um so anything that's called

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,959
rapping okay so when you're you rap

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
think of it like you have this question

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,040
mark the question mark is

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
having the creating that force field and

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
kind of wrapping that value to say hey

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
this may or may not be

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,360
uh this value may or not be a

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,600
nil um if it is nil we don't want

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,399
our application to crash we don't want

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
our function

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
to break down and you know we don't want

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,200
um

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
you know anything to go wrong so we

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
protect this value we don't want this to

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,839
be the cause of something else

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,839
right um a username so you see the

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
exclamation point and that is what you

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
call implicitly

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
unwrapping um you're unwrapping this

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,600
value so you're kind of leaving it open

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,959
you don't have that question mark where

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
it has the force field you're leaving it

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
open

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,440
um so that is the exclamation point

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,320
where you're unwrapping this value

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
and you're saying hey um i and you want

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
to do this with this very very like it

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,240
will complain to you

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,680
um if it feels like this is something

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
that needs to be wrapped or this is

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
something that needs to be unwrapped

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,720
so you know there's swift is very very

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
aware

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
and a hyper aware language when it comes

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,399
to again that memory factor right

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,000
so unwrapping

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,120
uh that value means that you trust

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,120
that this is not going to be new

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,040
okay so it does not need any protection

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,200
okay so those are those are optionals

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,880
something that you you definitely would

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
uh see and something that might

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,920
throw you off at first sight so moving

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,279
on into evolution

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,880
something happened in 2015.

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,320
swift became open sourced yes swift

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,320
became open source

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,760
and this was a really big deal

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,839
um you know all of a sudden there was

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
this

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,720
community of uh

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,720
developers who kind of rallied around

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
this language and for the first time

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
this was something that

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,519
um apple was sort of giving to the

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,480
developer community to say hey

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,279
we are letting you in this is our most

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
prized

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
uh you know baby this is our new

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
language right

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,480
and we're giving you some input we're

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,279
giving you a voice

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,160
um and we're giving you power to be able

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
um you know build community around it

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
and

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
make it the language that you want uh

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,680
make it the language that you

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,160
need um so that was the first time that

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200
apple had given the developer community

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,320
that sort of

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,320
uh power and it was amazing

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,440
to date um swift has

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,200
over 800 contributors over a hundred

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,880
thousand commits

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,240
um over 1600 releases to date

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,360
um over 8 000 forks

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
and around 500 pull requests okay so

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
that that

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
speaks a lot too if you think about the

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,399
releases and the commits and all

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
it seems a lot a lot to how active the

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
community is

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,360
right we say swift what became open

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,480
source in 2015 it's 2020.

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,959
you know we're getting updates every six

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
months

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,120
sometimes it's every four months um

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,160
where we're getting a new

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,639
version of swift where it's now

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
more direct it's more simple like oh

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
okay um

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,200
i was able to kind of infer what

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,360
this meant in swift now this is more

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,399
direct it's even more direct even more

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,440
simplified

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,639
um even more legible as a language right

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,040
and even more

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,959
um optimize you know the the compiler

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,320
itself so

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,440
this is all due to the collective effort

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
between apple

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
and the developer community and this

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,440
speaks to a lot of

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,480
a lot of the work that has gone into

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,839
building

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:24,320
uh this awesome uh powerful language

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,120
and like i said it's it's it was this

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
new thing

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
right it was one thing for it to be open

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,839
source

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
you know and it was great for the

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
community but there was still this kind

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
of like

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,920
issue where you know for one it was

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,519
swift was still for mobile

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,360
right um or for ios um it was still

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,399
used for the apple platform so a lot of

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,240
because apple is so niched right um

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,000
you know you know basically there's this

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
king apple theory that i always talk

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,279
about

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
um and basically that means that you

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,160
must

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,760
build um with apple products

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,199
for apple products um

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,360
building apple products uh with an apple

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,959
language right so there's this whole

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,079
kind of like ecosystem

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,440
very niched ecosystem that

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,160
um ultimately a lot of

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,360
developers don't want to outside of you

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,320
know people who were

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,760
in that realm a lot of newcomers they

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
don't want to enter that because they

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,560
don't want to feel boxed in

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,639
right and also apple just had this

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,519
history of not having

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,360
as much transparency when it comes to

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
just the community so the fact that this

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
is all new

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
um and a lot of developers felt like

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,760
they would be boxed in

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,880
um by choosing to uh you utilize swift

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,399
as a language

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,600
um it was a it wasn't all that

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,279
um easy to to make a transition so

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
and for some it was just outright a turn

00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
off

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,839
then something else happened later in

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,040
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,240
server-side swift was introduced okay

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,440
yes swift on the server

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,720
okay so what did this mean okay

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,160
now we're crossing over into uh

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,360
you know swift now transcending beyond

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
just apple um and into this serverless

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
realm

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
right um and what did all what did this

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,720
mean as well like

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,519
multiple ides now um like i said you had

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,600
to build

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,040
with the apple language you know on

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,399
apple products right for

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,720
apple products um and before you could

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
not

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,519
use swift outside of xcode

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,440
um and now with this

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,320
new found you know

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,279
variety in this these capabilities now

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,079
you're able to use it

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,920
use them in other environments so xclo

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,279
xcode of course sublime

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,560
atom code runner vs code you name it

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:12,880
um they're they're swift support for

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,320
every single um one of those ides

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,160
so now again it starts to people outside

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,199
of the mobile community like

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
okay still a little skeptical but

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,800
they're like oh

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
wow swift on the server what is that

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
what is that like

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,839
hmm and so and then that adds this other

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
this other benefit right as a developer

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,680
adding

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
end to end capabilities what does that

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,759
mean

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,800
that means that now if i wanted to build

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,399
my back end uh using swift

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
and of course i would build my front end

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
natively

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,680
you know if i was a mob so if i let's

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,320
say i'm a mobile developer

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,759
and i'm building my front end natively

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
with swift

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,160
you can build my back end natively with

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,199
swift kind of makes me a full stack

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,680
developer right purely with swift

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,240
so adding these end-to-end capabilities

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,000
for people to

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,360
build out their applications entirely

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,559
and solely just using swift

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:21,360
so this was this is a huge huge deal

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,799
some of the um these are some of you

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,240
know some of the server-side swift

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,839
frameworks

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,720
some of you may have heard of vapor

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,360
vapor is the top um the top

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,039
uh server-side swift framework and i say

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
it's the top not just because it's like

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,160
well my favorite

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,200
um but just in terms of the um

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,640
the bandwidth of the community um the

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,000
support

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,160
um the amount of documentation

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and just its popularity it's known for

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,120
its speed

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,080
and uh so it it from the community

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,360
standpoint

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,600
uh vapor is the top um

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,760
server-side swift framework and then we

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
have perfect.org which was the

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,559
very first server-side swift framework

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,039
um that was utilized

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,600
that was created and that was in later

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,039
on

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,480
after uh swift became open source

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,919
later on in 2015. uh then you have

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,240
katora katora

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:31,280
was ibm's server-side swift framework

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:34,400
um and the thing about katora is it

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,000
was very much a high contender a very

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,640
close second to vapor

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,919
in terms of community in terms of uh

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,799
stability

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
uh but it was sadly sunsetted i believe

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,840
earlier this year

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
and i think they're trying to figure out

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,320
something else to do

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,039
um as far as repurposing it instead of

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
just like

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,559
deprecating it all together but as far

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
as

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,440
ibm goes in katora right now it

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
is pretty much sunsetted um

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,039
and then swift engine swift engine is

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,039
this like independent kind of

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,760
um framework and basically it's like the

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,240
first

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,679
turnkey like serverless swift platform

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
for app development

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
um and i'd like to bring it up because

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
uh some friends of mine

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
actually created this and their

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,160
instructors over at

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,280
usc so basically you know swift

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,039
on the server is truly on the rise and

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
is also now being supported in

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,559
conjunction with platforms like

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,840
um aws lambda apache uh

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,039
openwhisk um and google cloud so you've

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,320
probably

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,440
seen a glimpse of swift here and there

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,799
and you're just like

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,679
why how um yes it it is

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,559
growing in terms of uh that presence and

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,080
support

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,640
on these different platforms even in

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,520
containerization right so we're moving

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,520
into devops now right you can now build

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,520
containerized applications on platforms

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,840
like aws

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,840
um openstack openstack has

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,200
an architecture called a swift stack so

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
you can run

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,039
swift servers on openstack

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,440
so yes this is a big deal this kind of

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,720
caused

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,919
a wave of

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,200
just that running into different realms

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
when it came to swift

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,799
now why are all of these uh

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
different frameworks being created like

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,559
you know what's the point of

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
using swift as a back-end like why would

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,240
i even do that

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,039
i have node i have all of these

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,919
different

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
you know all the typical and more

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,200
popular

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:54,159
widely used languages and frameworks

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,159
okay why would i use swift

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
and a large part of that ghost is

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
attributed to performance

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,480
we talked about that we talked about how

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,000
it's a very safe and

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,919
and very fast language and that's where

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,200
the popularity kind of like

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,159
hit home for a lot of people but i mean

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,520
you don't have to take my word for it um

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,240
you know a lot of people are like oh

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,360
okay like is it really that fast there

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,400
really well let's try it out

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,679
i'm gonna go to this link right now

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,760
and we're gonna test it out for

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,760
ourselves how about that

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,039
okay hold on one second i'm gonna stop

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,039
sharing for just a minute

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,600
okay and we are gonna head to this

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,840
site

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,840
okay which is benchmarks game okay

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,840
and what we're going to do is let me go

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,840
ahead and re-share this

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,080
okay so this

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,080
is the computer language benchmarks game

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,440
okay and you can literally just

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,640
basically test out uh performance

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,760
and and uh run these different

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,840
languages against each other okay

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,559
um so you get there's like a different

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,600
uh algorithms here

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,200
and you can test these

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,520
uh languages against each other um

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,440
with these uh algorithms to run these

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,840
algorithms so let's just go ahead

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
i'm gonna click on swift okay

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
and it's going to test swift against

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,440
these different ones right now

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,559
so versus c versus c plus plus versus go

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,760
versus java versus rust okay so

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:59,039
um it started us off swift versus java

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,640
okay and here we have our first

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,799
algorithm this is the name of our first

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,159
algorithm yes this is a real

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,159
real program here

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,000
okay oh this is like the listing on here

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,039
okay it's a real program here okay and

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,559
what we have is swift versus java

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,480
okay uh you see we've run this

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,840
program and swift has compiled in 1.87

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,039
seconds compared to java 4.15 seconds

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,000
okay you can see the the memory usage

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,919
here

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,600
um that's just i mean 39 000 compared to

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,799
79 000 okay we can see the cpu

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,880
uh loaded right um

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,080
and again it goes down with these

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
different uh

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,080
algorithms uh and so we have this

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,440
this new algorithm called in body and

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,120
again it beats

00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,559
java 4.89 seconds compared to java

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,279
um 6.76 seconds

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,120
okay um and it goes on and on and on and

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,400
on right these different ones okay

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,000
so java let's try go

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
go is one of my favorite languages as

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,919
well okay same

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,840
algorithms okay uh 1.87 seconds

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,400
as it was before with this algorithm and

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,279
then go 3.75

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,960
seconds to compile okay and you can

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,200
pretty much it's pretty much

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:33,840
faster than a lot of these different

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,840
let's try c plus plus

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,520
okay just just

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,320
faster in this in this algorithm right

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,520
here just

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,640
like there's some milliseconds there um

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,240
where swift beats c plus plus right and

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
it's kind of neck and neck here and you

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,640
can even see it

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,559
you know kind of where uh uh c plus plus

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,080
kind of gets swift in the end but

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,559
all in all swift is widely known for

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,600
being

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,720
super fast super performant um

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,200
and when it comes to uh

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,120
compiling so again when we think about

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
what's important to us

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,039
um that is an important factor as a

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,240
developer

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:29,840
okay so let us

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:29,840
go back to sharing our screen here

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,640
okay cool so these are the

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,440
basically the reasons you know swift has

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,400
been a top 10 language to learn

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,640
almost since his birth okay let's say

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,559
you know it was born it was born in 2014

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,600
let's say at least

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,279
since 2015 that i've seen that i've

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,880
personally seen

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,919
on the basically the top uh

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
tech publications out there swift has

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,919
been a top

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
10 language consistently every year to

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,240
learn

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,559
um since it's become open source

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,919
you know running right into uh being

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,159
used on the server

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,200
um where you're building web

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,760
applications

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,559
people are even building websites with

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
swift

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,279
um you know you're

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
building you know you're creating

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,919
endpoints a back end

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
um in becoming full stack you know got

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,880
swift developers now becoming full stack

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,000
developers

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,240
using running purely swift um

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
it's a huge huge deal and there's a lot

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,480
of potential and it's

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,360
growing so much to the point where it

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
the demand for swift experience is just

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
continuing to rise continuing to

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
continue to rise

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
so at this point it might seem like i'm

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,919
selling the language to you oh

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,760
swift is so great yes look how fast it

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,400
is look how clean it is look at this

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
look at that

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
so it might sound like i'm just kind of

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,559
selling it to you like okay

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,120
all right you know even though it's good

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,559
these are all facts this is all true

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,760
you know you're like okay uh but

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,360
do i want to use swift is this something

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
that i really want to do

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,960
you know and it all comes down to this

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,960
question what are your

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,960
priorities as a developer right so

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,799
is swift appropriate for the

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,320
applications or the project that you're

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,880
working on right now right

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,840
or want to work on could swift be a

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
better

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,200
uh and more feasible medium for you to

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,960
work with

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,559
um these are things that i'm just trying

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,240
to expose you to

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,880
just when you're considering these

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,240
things um i was responding to a tweet

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,279
actually yesterday

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
um a huge education platform uh took

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,240
down their

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,360
swift content and they were like hey we

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,360
want to take it down

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,440
because we want something that is

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,880
cross-plat we want to offer

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,919
content on cross-platform frameworks and

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,039
languages

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,120
and that was understandable

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,679
but it it spoke to a lot it spoke a lot

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
to

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
how much people don't know about the

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,520
language um

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,279
they were saying that uh swift is just

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,399
for ios and

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,200
we don't want to um we don't want to

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,960
cater to just

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,559
ios development and that's fine but

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
it speaks a lot to how much people

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,480
really don't know about the capabilities

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,919
of the swift language because it's way

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,559
way beyond

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
uh just ios development and just that

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,120
apple

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,120
uh kind of stratosphere

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,399
so let's get into the future of swift we

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,919
talked about how

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,760
easy it is to read um with all the great

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,279
work that the open source community

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039
has been doing and all the great

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,520
improvements and all the very

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,320
swift no pun intended improvements that

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,279
have been have

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
happening every couple of months um you

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,200
know

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,399
it's become easier to read right um

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,559
less of an inference and more of a very

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,679
direct um you know syntax right

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,559
uh the the the open source community

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,320
has been growing immensely like

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,200
continuing to grow

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,000
um and that just speaks volumes to how

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
much people are

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
actually going to learn uh

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,440
swift development and people are really

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,640
really picking up and trying it

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,000
in their different respective realms

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,600
right

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,640
um we can also expect for it to be

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
more performant and type safe as it has

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,559
been

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,000
but just growing and enhancing in those

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,279
spaces as well

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,720
um server side i believe they're going

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,320
to be a lot more improvements when it

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,440
comes to uh

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,520
the uh for server side swift

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
again people are building web apps a lot

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,760
of people don't know that they can build

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,120
um web apps you know so people are using

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
it but not as much

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,440
as they they could because people are

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,760
still kind of on the

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,520
they're they're they're on the cusp when

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,600
it comes to it right um they may have

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,360
tried it out once and they're just like

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,640
okay is this something that i'm ready to

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,000
take to production

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,799
absolutely swift is even if in its youth

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,840
six years um you know swift is

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,399
absolutely

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,919
stable enough um and absolutely

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,200
supported enough

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,679
for you to continue and to

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
try things out and to you know push

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
things into production

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,960
and really have something that is of

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,159
value

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,000
i expect to see um more

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,480
usage when it comes to microservices and

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,600
containerization as i've seen

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,600
you know people like aws and openstack

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,919
it's a big deal for them to

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,960
make those kinds of decisions to support

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,080
that right

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,720
um and so i can only see more growth and

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,960
more

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
coverage in terms of like swift presence

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,960
and support

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,799
um when it comes to those two things

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
microservices and containerization as

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,279
well

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,640
so next i'm going to get into some

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,320
trends

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
and developments with swift that you

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,840
will definitely see

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,919
on the rise in the future

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:31,440
okay first and foremost

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,880
swift ui swift ui um

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
i get really excited when i think about

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,120
swift ui uh swift ui

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
is about a year old itself you've

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,720
probably seen

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,720
uh developers on twitter in different

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,840
form forums

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,559
uh speaking of swift ui and you're like

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,880
what is this

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,399
swift ui everyone keeps talking about

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,600
basically swift ui is a

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:57,519
you know a new uh declarative framework

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,519
um that was released with ios 13

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,200
and it was used to create user

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,919
interfaces for swift

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,799
so for people who are coming from

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,880
objective c

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,360
this is um almost equivalent to ui kit

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,080
but this

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,760
is something a little bit different it's

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,039
actually a lot faster and it's actually

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,760
something that is

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,039
even more declarative when it comes to

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,720
building out these beautiful

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,000
and reactive um interfaces

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,120
um and just so you all are aware swift

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,679
is

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,240
geared more towards the apple platform

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,200
so

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,120
you can only utilize this to this

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,080
framework to build for ios

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,960
watch os and or mac os but it makes it

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,679
easier

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,120
to basically port your applications on

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,120
all three platforms at once

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,760
swift for windows but you didn't know

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,039
this was coming up

00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,640
um swift maintainers have been

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,120
hard at work on this for at least the

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,799
past

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,240
year or so um and

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,679
yes it's finally is finally here um

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,200
basically you know with these core

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,840
libraries um with swift's core libraries

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,640
um and you know the flexible you know we

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,399
call we talked about interoperability

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,200
um you know with swift um of swift with

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,399
c

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,360
uh it's now possible to develop

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,480
um applications on windows purely in

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,240
swift

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
okay so you know you can take advantage

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,000
of the

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,039
existing kind of like you know uh

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,159
core libraries on the the the windows

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,640
platform

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,760
um utilizing swift so yes you can build

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,480
applications

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,960
um swift applications on windows yes and

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,240
they do

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,600
so if you go to uh swift.org you

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,279
can utilize um

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,440
you know all of that documentation to

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,799
learn how to install

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,480
swift on your uh windows machine

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
and basically get started they even have

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,240
an example application

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,079
for you to get started with if that's

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,000
something you wanted to try

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,280
um we do have some early adopters

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,159
already kind of

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
up and running um but yes this is live

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,200
this is real

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,079
so uh yeah if you want to try it out you

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,119
can go over to swift.org

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,639
ps uh you can also install

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,919
swift on linux as well i get a lot of

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,879
questions about that

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,560
and yes you can install swift on linux

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,520
as well so again if you want to learn

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,280
more

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,240
um head over to the swift.org

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,240
site to learn more

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:54,560
how relevant is

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:58,560
hello oh yes

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:03,280
um so yes uh how relevant is swift

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,960
in the industry how relevant is swift

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,000
again you want you want to know

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,880
if you if you're thinking of okay

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,960
it's coming from apple still there's a

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
little bit of skepticism

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,040
you know i see that it's growing in

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,079
these different spaces like how relevant

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
is this gonna be

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,040
and like you know right now in the next

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,480
year in the next five years in the next

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,839
10 years like

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,839
swift has rightfully earned you know a

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,599
place in just about every realm as we

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,720
can see you know as we've kind of talked

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,079
about and kind of

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,040
you know um dove into

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,240
you know swift has slowly but surely if

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,440
you can call it

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,960
slowly in six years right um

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,680
earned its place of support

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,040
and presence in just almost every realm

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,640
um

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
so as you can see like the importance of

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,119
having like a powerful

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,839
compiler along with like the simple and

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,200
direct

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,640
syntax um that that legibility right it

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,079
goes a long way

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,960
for developers and you know our entire

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,200
workflow

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,000
you know in our decision making so it

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,160
goes a long way

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,680
and it goes well beyond like i said that

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,680
apple stratosphere

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,760
so much so that you know people

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,200
and uh in the machine learning

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,480
realm have started to adopt it yes so

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,400
uh yes you've probably seen or maybe

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,160
you haven't seen this may be your first

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,240
time seeing

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,440
or hearing the fact that swift is being

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,079
utilized

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,119
um within machine learning and data

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,760
science so

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
um you know since python python of

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,680
course being

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,520
probably the more widely used primary

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,560
language when it comes to

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,160
machine learning python is notorious for

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,280
being slow

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,320
um it's open up the opportunity for

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,760
you know other programming languages to

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:11,040
sort of like tap in um you know

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,599
to the data science landscape so swift

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,800
in general is about

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,000
eight times faster than python um

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
and the types aren't checked in python

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,440
so

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,000
the program might like encounter like a

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
a type error at runtime and it may crash

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,880
and then

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
you know when you're using swift the

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,760
possibility of that happening

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,760
is less is less likely because swift is

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,960
statically typed right

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,320
so it's very powerful when it comes to

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
machine learning

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,320
um for those of you who are unfamiliar

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,480
with tensorflow

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
it's an open source library created by

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,119
google

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,440
uh built to help you develop and

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,079
maintain

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,880
to me develop and train machine learning

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,400
models

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,839
so everything from object detection to

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,040
image classification um you know

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:08,640
tender flow has been that

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,280
an awesome awesome uh tool

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,119
and of course like swift a language like

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,240
swift for tensorflow is highly reliant

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,560
upon swift's

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,839
um operability with python

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,640
so uh yeah and basically chris lattner

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,079
the

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,599
um he he's a former engineer at apple

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,320
who ultimately created swift he was like

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,839
the

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,160
primary creator uh of the swift language

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,599
over at apple um he went over to

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,200
google to help them out and to kind of

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,200
push the uh the the

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,079
the influence and the presence and

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,680
support uh when it comes to

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,920
uh tensorflow being utilized with swift

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,960
um and yeah this is something that

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,680
they're working on

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:05,200
uh they have some things that are

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,160
in the works um very much not production

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,839
ready

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,359
if you go on the tensorflow site they

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,560
will let you know that swift potential

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,240
flow is

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,000
technically still in beta but it is

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,880
something that again

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,480
can you're considering the fact that

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,520
swift is so young

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,000
and someone as big as google or as big

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
as

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,839
you know uh you know the the team that's

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,359
where the google brain

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,440
team is working on this and hard at work

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:35,280
and really considering swift

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,760
when it comes to machine learning

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
so i thought that was very powerful very

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,880
powerful

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,800
so who is it relevant for

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,160
answers we're all in this together as

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
you can see

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,839
whether you're an ios developer back-end

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,720
developer

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,079
devops engineers front-end developers

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,800
data scientists

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,839
junior devs senior devs mid-level devs

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,880
whatever

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,160
you know we have again swift has

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,400
transcended

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,440
the the stratosphere of just

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,640
apple and now all of us are able to be

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,240
in this room and talk about how

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
important swift is

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,920
in our different aspects in our

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,280
different fields

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,040
um as a programming language right

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,400
um and we're able to talk to each other

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,480
help each other

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,880
um even work more um

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,160
together in conjunction with each other

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,520
when it comes to

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,280
uh building our applications with swift

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,280
so we're all in this together

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,720
and it goes back to what are

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,319
your priorities as a developer

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,200
is it right for you um

00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,680
and those are things that considering

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,880
what's

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,319
out there for swift considering um

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,160
all those different features that we

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,359
talked about of the swift language

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,119
uh the different uh areas of support

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,280
um think about the things that you're

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,640
working on or that you want to work on

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,680
whether you're an enterprise or you're

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,720
just an indie developer

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,920
is swift something that you're

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,280
interested in

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,440
you know you're interested in trying

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,000
you're interested in maybe

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,040
you know an alternative to the language

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,680
that you're

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,480
uh utilizing whether you're building a

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,319
web app

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,839
building you know a back end um

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,520
with you know your front end in one

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,760
language swift for a back end

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,599
like is this something that i want to do

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,000
why would i want to do that

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,960
right and it all comes down to what your

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,839
priorities are

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,839
as a developer

00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,800
so to learn more and get started

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,599
i would say the swift.org site

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
that i mentioned uh definitely go on

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,400
there

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,079
that's where you know you can find the

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,040
sort of forum for the open source

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
community

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,200
and all the different developments uh

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,760
you know along the swift journey

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,079
uh of course the apple documentation

00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:23,119
raywinderlick.com has very very

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:26,560
um just updated content

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,720
constant content on uh swift development

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,720
hacking with swift of course which is

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,319
led by paul hudson

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,359
um has a lot of great great resources

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,880
um o'reilly uh i've been

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,359
giving a lot of um trainings i'm

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,319
a recent instructor and author on the

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,760
o'reilly

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:51,040
learning platform and uh you know we are

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,880
growing in terms of the the uh

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,880
presence and the support that we have

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,920
for learning and getting started with

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,359
swift

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,839
and of course you can follow me on

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,760
twitter at tamara j you know

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,160
to learn more about the swift language

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,160
as well

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,960
and again it's safe to say that

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:16,079
uh swift will be a top 10 language uh

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,359
in 2021 and beyond

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,800
it's too important it's too um you know

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,400
it's adopted in all these different

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
areas not because they're just like oh

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,079
is this new thing

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,040
no all these different companies all of

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,040
these different

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,599
arenas they see the potential

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,160
in swift all these different companies

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,560
who

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,680
are now in demand for people with swift

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,640
experience

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,040
there is a demand there for a reason and

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,000
so

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,800
my prediction is of course swift is a

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,720
top 10

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,440
will be a top 10 language for 2021 and

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,440
well beyond

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,160
and that is all i have for you today

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,040

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,040
much

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,960
all right thank you tamara so much um

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,400
we have time for one question

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,160
okay one question ah

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,960
i see one question in the q and a we

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,960
have one question

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,720
and says are there any swift

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,760
alternatives

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,560
to front-end frameworks like angular

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,560
view react

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,400
swift alternatives to front-end

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,119
frameworks hmm

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,240
uh i think at the at the moment

00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:01,440
um you know at the moment you have a

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,440
swift ui which again we talked about it

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,319
being a declarative framework

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,079
for building out your front ends swift

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,319
ui is probably the best bet

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,880
and it's so easy to get started with

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,280
swift ui there's a lot of content

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,000
that is i mean even in just it's only

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,880
been

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,400
out for a year um but that framework is

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,760
probably the most powerful

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,839
um the most effective and um it's

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,280
constantly just gaining that that

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,200
presence and support from the community

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,640
so you can see a lot more content

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,839
on how to learn and how to get started

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,040
with swift ui yeah

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,040
do we have time for one more

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,520
yes okay

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,839
let's see

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,319
unrelated to code i love your hair

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,800
thanks

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,480
thank you so much let me see um i'm

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,520
going to the q a

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,640
oh you mean oh sorry to clarify i mean

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,680
web frameworks uh

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,800
i don't i don't i don't think so i don't

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,160
think so

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,359
um but again if you look into the server

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,680
side

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:23,680
swift frameworks you can basically build

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,440
web applications um using

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,960
some of those frameworks one of them

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,880
being vapor vapor

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,640
specifically has a um

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,560
basically a a capability of uh

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,319
templating it has this like templating

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,720
component called leaf

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:46,160
and you can utilize html and

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,680
javascript as well in conjunction with

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,720
swift

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,680
uh in order to build web applications so

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,119
yeah i would try

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,160
a vapor which is a server-side swift

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,200
framework

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,400
um yeah try out vapor and just see

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,319
see how it goes they have a lot of

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,040
documentation as well

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,400
so um yeah and you can always um hit me

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,839

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,839
