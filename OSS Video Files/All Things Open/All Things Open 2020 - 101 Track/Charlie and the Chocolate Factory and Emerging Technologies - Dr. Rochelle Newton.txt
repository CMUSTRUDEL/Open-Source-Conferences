Abstract: The current information/technological revolution has moved beyond academia and business.  For many, information technology (IT) was a black hole of mystery.  Today, technology is now a considerable component of our personal, professional, and social lives.

The Federal Government and post-secondary education spearheaded early advances in (IT).  IT did not become an acronym until 1978.  The initial adoption of technologies came in the form of computations.  Slowly organizations recognized the capacity of computing and Mooreâ€™s Law became the measure.  As technology evolved, computing staff developed into some of the roles that exist today.  Each decade the application and use of technology have increased.  As a result, the skills of non-technologists and technologists increased.  The diversity of career choices led to horizontal and vertical opportunities. 

Today, technology threatens IT and non-IT jobs. However, as emerging technologies have disrupted traditional technology, some jobs will expand and others will disappear.  Research suggests half of the current workforce will no longer be needed or new skills will be required. 

This presentation will discuss new careers in IT and augmenting the IT toolbag.  Advocation and mentorship may become the axiom of transformation.

my name is rochelle

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
newton and i am

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,359
operating manager at duke health

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
and presenting with me today is drew

is the end all and know all of

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,119
everything

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,480
is to know about technology julius

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,439
i i appreciate that intro

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,000
i do do works on central i.t at duke and

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
i work in the health system

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,239
so we are going to talk to you today

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,480
about charlie and the chocolate factory

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
and when i submitted this presentation

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
to todd

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
and danny i got a bunch of question

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
marks so they thought we were going to

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
watch the children's movie

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
um but i want to know how many of you

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,960
have seen the

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,320
movie and can you just say you know

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,559
raise your hand or something

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
and uh the moderator can you please tell

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,879
us how many people have seen charlie in

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,879
the chocolate factory

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,720
sure yeah you can use the chat people

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
can use the chat and just say that

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
yeah it looked like about like half or

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,759
so of the attendance that uh had a

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
had a hand going up so very very well

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
known movie that's good

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
absolutely so why would you think that

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
we would have this movie

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,400
as our our our talk for ato what why do

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,439
you think this is uh

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
important or relevant

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,320
and you can say it either in the uh chat

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
or you can say

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,840
uh you can tell the moderator however

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
you wish to do it

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,880
who knew tech is like how are you

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,000
so i will tell you so uh many people

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,119
as i have as i have talked about this

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
many people have missed um that little

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
small

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,799
subtle piece of the movie that had

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
nothing to do with

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,759
charlie the factory or candy

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,360
if you remember how the movie starts uh

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,360
the father the breadwinner mr bucket is

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
working in the factory and at the

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,239
chocolate factory

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,879
and along the way charlie discovers

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,640
i mean uh the the factory owner

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
discovers that

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,800
the secrets are leaking out of his

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
company and other people are making his

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
products

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,400
so he decides one day he's gonna fire

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,879
everyone and just run the factory

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,280
through some means that wasn't obviously

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,400
clear to us in the beginning

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,440
but mr buckets lost his job through no

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,000
fault of his own

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,879
only because his job could be automated

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,440
and if you paid attention to that when

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,400
you get

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,040
to near the end of the movie mr bucket

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,159
gets his job back

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
drew why does he get his job back uh

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,080
because somebody has to fix those robots

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,400
the robots don't run themselves

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
he's fixing the automation bits that

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
automated himself out of the job

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
which is uh fairly interesting and in a

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
lot of ways i think we as technologists

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
feel like

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
that's what we're doing is we're sort of

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,760
fixing these robots that are uh

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
probably going to replace us all in the

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
long run but

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,040
something's still got to fix them

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
absolutely and so the theme in the movie

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,239
is this golden tick

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
so who's going to get this golden ticket

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
and win this special prize

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
and if you've seen the movie you know

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
the special prizes uh

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,560
uh the factory owner is he he discovers

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
he has a gray hair

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
and he needs to have an heir to leave

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
his his company

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
too what's really idyllic about this

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,319
story the way it's

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,680
told is you see so many versions of

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,840
innovation some of it unreal

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
and some of it real but so many versions

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,599
of innovation so

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
the flying elevator um

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
do we ever think that will become a

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,480
thing

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,080
i i would vote yes um if you are a star

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
trek fan like i am

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
you know a lot of the technology in star

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,560
trek has somehow made its way to uh

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,759
to everyday life and so

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
go go ahead you know i was just going to

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,919
say yeah the

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
the other thing that i sort of liked

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,120
about this was even the the candy itself

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
was sort of

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
technology advanced like uh you know all

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
the little innovations they're doing

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
that's uh

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
a lot of parallels to our to our current

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
technology

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
and even having like being replaced by a

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
robot at the time

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
charlie and the chocolate factory was

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
written i don't think they were actually

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
replacing anybody with robots but now

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
it's a

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,840
a very very real thing absolutely

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,560
and the golden ticket for us today is

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
innovation automation and these emerging

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,080
technologies

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
and and how does that look for the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,360
future of work so if you've been in

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,840
information technology or stem science

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,479
technology engineering math and medicine

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,600
you've seen a lot of innovations happen

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
uh over the last few years so

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
the future of work for those of us that

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,759
work in technology

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
for the most part is pretty secure right

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
because

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,880
stem fields have very low unemployment

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
you know there's not a great deal of

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
turnover unless we're

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
you know chasing money you know we may

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,800
change jobs but for the most part we're

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
pretty stable and we don't see a lot of

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
you know hiccups in in the job market

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
for our work

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
there are some parts of our jobs that

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,039
play more and some that pay less

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,680
but for the most part it's pretty stable

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,840
but when we go back to mr bucket we can

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
make an assumption that mr bucket was an

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,280
ordinary joe right working an

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
ordinary job manual labor you know

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,800
screwing tops on toothpaste you know

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,759
just an ordinary guy and for

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
reasons not his own fault he loses his

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,639
job

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
what's not said in charlie and the

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,800
chocolate factory is what he had to do

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,520
to get the job back to fix the machine

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
as drew mentioned and so when we think

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,080
about these emerging technologies

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,039
think about the ones that you know that

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,720
are poised to disrupt

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,560
jobs in a in the world so as a result of

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,880
covet would be like 21

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
22 million people are unemployed right

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
now and that's simply because of a

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,319
pandemic

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
but what happens when we're on the other

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
side of that pandemic

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
and companies who were hurt by this

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
pandemic then has to

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
figure out how to get their financial

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
footings

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,240
back so will they consider human beings

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
or will they consider

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
automation so drew

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
when you think about that what are the

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
thoughts that you think about

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,440
you know where we are in this pandemic

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,840
and the state of our economy

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
uh that's a great question um i mean i

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
think automation is going to be key in

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,800
getting a lot of these things

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
back online just because as people are

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,319
consuming less as we're all staying at

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,919
home that's going to be

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,880
less money flowing back into the economy

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,080
and that means

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,080
you know it's going to be harder for uh

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
everybody to both get jobs and keep

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
those jobs

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
and i think for everybody i think

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
everybody's also going to feel the burn

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
of we have to do

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,960
more with less right like

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,199
uh even if folks are keeping their jobs

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
jobs may not be you know people aren't

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
going to be hiring as much

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
there's just going to be there's going

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,160
to be a whole lot to do

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,599
and for better or worse i think focusing

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
on things like automation

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,319
having you know robots i say robots i

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
don't always mean like a mechanical arm

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,039
that's going to come out and twist a

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,800
twist a toothbrush cap on but uh

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,639
you know things that don't require human

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
interaction are going to be way

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,520
are going to continue to grow in

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,560
importance everywhere

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,879
absolutely and so for those of you who

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
are

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,199
uh shoppers um i am not particularly

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
but uh i often tell the story of sam

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,319
sam's club

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
is one of my favorite stores and it's

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,000
not because they sell things in bulk but

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
it's because i never have to talk to a

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,440
person from the minute i walk in the

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
door for the minute i walk out

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
i can scan everything on my phone i

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,879
click a button i pay

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,959
i get a qr code put it up against the

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,880
wall and i walk out

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,360
now as a black woman i should not be

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,000
excited about that because if you pay

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,320
any attention

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
to traditional retail black and brown

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
people are

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
other predominant people in those roles

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
so

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
my excitement to not have to deal with a

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
person

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,279
stems from my introvertedness but the

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
other part is

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,839
you know scanning and paying and waiting

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,200
in line behind

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,720
masses of people is time consuming for

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
me so i want to hurry up and come home

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,640
so i don't have to talk to anybody

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
so there's this thing to think about

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,760
these things so

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,680
everything that you can possibly think

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,320
of so i'll give you another one of those

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
examples

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
i've had my third rotator cuff surgery

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,920
this very last surgery i had in january

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
this year a robot did it not a person

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
and because the what they needed to do

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
was so delicate they didn't trust

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,760
human hands to do that so as we think

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,040
about these emerging technologies

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
my doctor my my ortho doctor uh has

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
worked on

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,720
coach k if you dude basketball many

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,519
uh kobe bryant many important people

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
who have orthopedic issues but with all

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
the skill

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
and experience that he has a robot

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,680
needed to do the job that was there and

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
if you think about all the industries

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
that are

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,120
subject to automation or emerging

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
technologies there's a lot

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
mckins there's a mckenzie report that

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,320
said by

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,480
2030 50 of all the job

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,560
classifications we know today will be

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
replaced by

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,320
automation innovation or some other kind

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
of technology but will not be done by a

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
person

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
so i'm going to ask you again drew going

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,680
back about the economy

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,240
so now that we've gotten maybe half of

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
our population slashed out of jobs

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
what are the steps that they should be

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
thinking about right now before we get

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
there

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,200
uh so one thing that i know that i've

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,360
tried to focus on as far as the

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
technology as far as technology has gone

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
is

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,760
trying to be one of those people that i

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,160
would say that fixes the machines

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
or that automates the automation right

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
like

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,600
as technologists some of the i would say

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
the boring stuff is the first stuff to

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
get automated right

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,560
and so as you're nobody wants their job

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
to be

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,920
totally automated so try and find ways

00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
to

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,120
automate it yourself and make yourself

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,200
valuable

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
uh in that way because you really have

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,959
to you really have to be doing something

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,839
uh

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,399
unique and valuable not just screwing

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,079
lids

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,760
onto toothpaste tubes

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,079
you know those lids need to be screwed

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,480
on but if it can be automated

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,680
i try and be the one automating it i

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,200
guess it's sort of the

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,640
the lesson that i've tried to take away

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,040
over the last 10 years or so

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
right so retooling yours your tool bag

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,839
right so we all

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,120
are good at what we do right so the

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,040
things that we've learned and we've

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,320
acquired this knowledge of we are very

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,640
good at this and we

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
you know go to conferences or take a

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,800
class or something to re

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,680
we reaffirm our skills but we're pretty

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,200
good at

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,720
but imagine if you had to

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,360
fix the tooth the tooth brush

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,360
screw topper robot and you've never had

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,800
any experience with that

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,880
and so for marginalized groups you know

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,560
once you're in a career typically you

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
like to stay in that career

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,399
and you believe you have enough

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,360
wherewithal to be successful in that

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
career

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,600
but with emerging technologies sitting

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,760
comfortably in our seats

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,279
it's going to be a bit challenging i'm

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
going to read something to you i

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,320
this wouldn't fit on my screen but on my

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
powerpoint but i want to share this so

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,519
here are some things that are likely to

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,959
be disrupted

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,399
travel websites and the need for humans

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,600
to schedule to travel did you think

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,440
about that

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,760
how about tax software how many of you

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,720
do terrible taxes to your taxes

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
newspapers gone no people in the

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
newsroom anymore

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
language transition translation so

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
google translate and there are a

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,839
gazillion others

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
gone secretaries phone operators

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,839
executive assistants and all of those

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,639
fancy titles

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,000
gone financial professionals your tax

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
accountants your

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,959
your uh trust uh uh folks gone

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
because it can be done to aid in

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,680
automated systems

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,560
job recruiters gone uber

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,040
lyft replaces taxi cabs livery drivers

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,399
and anything else

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,440
driverless cars replace truck drivers

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,880
chauffeurs whatever you can imagine

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,800
that's out there drone technology

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
amazon will no longer bring their nice

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,880
mercedes truck on your street and drop

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,920
your packets off they're gonna drone it

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,680
onto your street 3d printing

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
so instead of having something

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,680
manufactured or created in

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,760
in a factory such as a car 3d

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
printing will make make its way to the

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,440
point where you can

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
go somewhere punches of codes and your

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,279
car will be made

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
by this 3d printer now i imagine it's

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,040
got to be a pretty big 3d printer but a

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,360
3d printer assembly line workers

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,279
gone robots replace it you can see that

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
every day now if you go to the

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,560
coca-cola factory you can see it every

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
single day

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,160
it's a robot that's putting the coke and

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
tighten it up and putting it in the box

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,120
and moving it

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,720
postal workers gone which means that we

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
won't have any more postal students no

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
one can go postal anymore unless they're

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
a robot

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
fast foods right so how many of you been

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,079
to mcdonald's

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,440
recently and there's a kiosk right there

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,079
that you go in there and put your order

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
in you pay

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199
and the food just drops out the slot

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
right there that's the one near me

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,959
that's what happens

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,000
toll booth attendance gone radio djs

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,920
gone professors teachers

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,880
gone television programming

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,839
cable gone streaming services have taken

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,480
over

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
spotify and itunes replaced the music

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
industry

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,880
libraries and librarians gone farmers

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,399
and

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,279
ranchers gone all of this because

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,000
of emerging technologies so drew knowing

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
all of this

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
what are your thoughts about how this

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,920
will look in the new world that we're

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
we're going into how will this look

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,600
post covert how would this look you know

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,399
in an economy

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,959
that's less based on tangible things and

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
more intangible things

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,160
well you know it's funny like as you've

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
mentioned all of those things

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
i think probably everybody here in this

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,240
meeting has like

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,760
family friends uh even co-workers that

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
are affected in those industries and

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
then being gone is

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,920
i mean it sucks and it's uh it's

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
something that's uh very true and it

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,759
really hits home for everybody

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,680
uh my dad used to work in the newspaper

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,320
business and he's retired now but he

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
told us

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,720
he gives a an analogy of how when the

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,839
internet really began to blow up

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
everybody in the newspaper room was like

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,600
hey

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,199
we see this atomic bomb that went off

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
way over there in the distance and we

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519
know that blowback is going to come and

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,399
hit us

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,279
and decimate us and we just want to like

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,440
make it as

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,959
long as we can but you know there's no

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
way you know there's no running from

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,320
that mushroom cloud that's coming

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,320
uh there's no shielding yourself uh

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
you know it's coming you can't stop you

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
can't really stop technology it's gonna

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
it's gonna overtake you when it's gonna

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
overtake you and you know for better or

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,360
worse

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:15,199
that's what's gonna happen uh

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
one thing that uh that i really try and

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
do and that i think is helpful and

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,120
one thing that i noticed in the charlie

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
and the chocolate factory movie is that

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
mr bucket

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,160
and uh even grandpa

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,079
their personalities and their names are

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,240
so tied to their

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,639
profession and the chocolate factory

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,160
that when those jobs get decimated

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,160
it also decimates them as a family

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,519
and uh i think that's it's something

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
that's very hard like

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
i think of mr bucket it is a tool you

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
know

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,639
he's named after a tool and he's just

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
going in and doing this job every day

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
and that made me think like what if my

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
name was like

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,279
not drew stennit but drew linux or you

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
know

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,880
drew them and all of a sudden that tool

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
is no longer necessary

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,959
does that mean that you know me as a

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,120
person is no longer necessary

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,400
i it doesn't but it does mean that i'm

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,880
going to need to be conscious

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,880
about pivoting to something else and

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,839
also like knowing that's okay

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,240
you know if the linux world if

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,439
technology pivots and linux is no longer

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
something that is useful

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
for the community or it gets you know

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,120
taken over by something else

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,160
i don't want my name tied into that old

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,240
outdated technology i want to be able to

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
move to something else whatever that uh

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,880
whatever that next thing is

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,520
and like you mentioned how uh you know

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,640
as technology is moving we can't really

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,679
settle in and get comfortable with our

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
existing tech

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,919
because all of the existing tech today

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,880
it's as bad as it's going to get it's

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,960
only going to get better

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
so as you're staying still you're really

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
sort of moving backwards so you always

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,799
have to be thinking

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,400
about moving forward uh you know

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
if you have that downtime in your day

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,120
because i'm sure everybody has

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,440
tons of downtime in their day

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
you know

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
it's easy to think oh let me just sit

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
and take a breath and relax a little bit

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
but a lot of times that's good for

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
learning those new technologies and

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,640
making sure you're not you know sitting

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
idle having technologies move ahead of

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,039
you when you need to be

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,520
holding on to that wave and keeping up

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,600
absolutely and i think what's important

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
for all of you developers and open

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
source

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,600
gurus and all those things is to think

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
about the communities that will be

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,039
affected by the technologies that you

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,400
put forth out there

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,080
so um many of you you may remember

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,440
the equifax uh hack how many of you are

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,919
equifax customers zero

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,280
but the bank you deal with your credit

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,480
card whatever it is

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,679
is a customer of equifax so equifax did

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,200
a uh

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,280
well okay job of trying to put your mind

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
at ease you know they offered credit

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
monitoring

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
you know i think they offered some small

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,000
uh

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,080
amount of money um but there were

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,120
38 i think it was percent of the

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
population did

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,039
did not know what had happened what that

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,039
meant

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,080
so there's the unbanked the underbanked

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,440
the unfamiliar the uneducated the

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,600
unknowing world of money

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
so we all go to sleep at night because

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
we go to the nice bank and put our

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
paycheck

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
in there and it sits there until we need

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
it

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
there's a large segment of the

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,240
population that still puts their money

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
in the mattress

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,000
you know so if the house burns down

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
there goes their money

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
but what's really important about these

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,240
things that you are developing

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,520
they need to be in english speak not

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,760
tech speak

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,600
because if you are a great technologist

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
and you have great ideas and you know

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,720
how to do all these things

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,960
how fast or how well would that reach

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,720
the entire marketplace and if you

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,320
compare microsoft to

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,440
apple in the early days dos

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,960
was as complex of a language that i had

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
ever seen in my life

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,720
and i had done a symbol f i didn't

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
foretrain i did cobalt i understood that

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
but when i

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,200
encountered dos i was completely

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,600
perplexed whereas when i

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,320
cr encountered the apple operating

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,919
system it was almost seamless

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
when you're thinking about developing

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,960
these automated tools you need to think

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,880
about who you're developing them for

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
what's ironic about charlie in the

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
chocolate factory

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
he had a market out there a huge market

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,360
of people who won his

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,120
goods but he shut them out he said

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
you're stealing my secrets i don't want

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,159
you in my factory i don't want you

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
around me i'm going to go find these

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,120
other people to do this

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,720
as such what's not clear in that movie

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,960
is what happened to that base

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
his consumer base when he did that so

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
the people who he fired

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
did he lose them as customers so as

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,840
you're developing technology and

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
thinking about technology

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,159
think about it from perspective of not

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
from the chair you sit in but the chair

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
that's

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
facing you who's going to buy your

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,880
products who's going to hire you to do

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,840
their work

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,200
do you speak enough playing speak that

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,200
you get your message across

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:23,360
so my next slide

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,240
is unemployment right so you can imagine

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,480
that with these

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,760
emerging technologies and innovation and

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
all those things some people are going

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
to lose their jobs and drew talked about

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,000
that a little bit

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
we have to start thinking about this not

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
just for ourselves

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,840
but for them as well because for the

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,159
people that are losing their jobs and

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,360
may not be able to find another job

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
how are they going to survive what do

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
you think their options are going to be

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
so

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,919
will we have social socialized programs

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,679
will we have

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,320
more government supported options

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,520
or will we think about how to bring

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,720
these people along with

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,840
us so one of the things that i i

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,799
i like best about myself is i am an

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,440
advocate

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,600
i do not believe i belong by myself if i

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,159
can help someone else along the way

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,880
that's how i i get my joy at the end of

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
the day

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
and as technologists used to embrace

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,400
that idea too

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
because there's an old school of thought

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,120
that says if you know it

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,360
you can teach it teach someone else how

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,960
to retool their tool bag if they haven't

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,440
figured it out

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
so drew you might want to tell them

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
about

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,520
your work at duke and and i will give

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
you a little hint

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,640
so when we were still in the building

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,640
you came

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
to various parts of the university with

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
a team and he taught us something new

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,880
all the time so do would you talk about

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,159
that a little bit

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,360
uh yeah absolutely uh it's funny you

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,760
mentioned that because a lot of times i

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
feel

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,200
like i'm more of a sponge than a

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,919
fountain but this reminds me of more of

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
a fountain time so

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,000
so the way duke is set up is we have uh

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
we have schools we have a school of law

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,840
we have fuqua we have

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
you know different department i would

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,159
call them almost like departments that

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,080
are outside

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,760
of central i.t and within central i.t

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
i would say we do a lot of cool stuff

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
but a lot of times the cool stuff that

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,080
we do

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360
doesn't necessarily translate out to

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,559
departments and i'll use like

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,919
law first as an example because uh while

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679
rachelle and i might talk

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,520
you know we don't always talk about

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,159
specific technologies we don't talk

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,000
about what central it is doing

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,679
uh so we would have little uh

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
i would call them about once every month

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,280
or once every two months because a lot

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,520
of times i forget to uh schedule them or

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,360
get lazy and don't schedule them

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,640
but we would just have these information

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,559
sharing sessions where

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
we would get a group of us together and

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,200
we would focus

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,360
on a topic whether it was uh

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,400
openshift or get lab or

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,080
any sort of technology that

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
one group has found interesting and i

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
think it worked it worked really well

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
because

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,400
it gave us an excuse to to talk about

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,720
these things like

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
a lot of times in central i.t we'll find

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
a cool technology

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,039
and we don't really know how to get that

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,720
out to

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,120
everyone else we'll use it ourselves

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,159
and it's great and you know i think a

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,000
lot of times

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,360
we get in our lane and that's great we

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,360
use it ourselves that's fine

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
but there's so many people outside of

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,600
our group that can use it like

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,960
you know law or any of the schools and

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
so having that uh

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,559
you know if they weren't long meetings

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
we would just meet around lunch for a

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,520
couple hours

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
and just talk about something and i

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799
think that was a really good way to sort

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,880
of get that knowledge out there

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:50,080
like we don't need

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,240
we as central i.t don't need to

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,159
you know do a tutorial on this is how

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,840
you program and this is how you edit and

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
this is exactly how you deploy

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,559
everything

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,039
but we can at least start planting those

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,000
seeds and just get the ideas out there

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,400
and let people know

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,520
hey this cool thing that i'm doing in my

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,440
group

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
maybe your group can use it as well and

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,600
then maybe when your group finds

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
something cool

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
you'll let us know about it and we can

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
use it as well

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,120
no one group can know everything and

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,600
like rochelle said

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
being an advocate is a being an advocate

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,279
for your group is a real

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,200
i think it's a great thing and so

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,320
through this we uh

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,240
we formed a team of i don't know 10

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
20 people and i think it's a really good

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,159
resource for

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,919
sharing ideas and back when we could

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,520
actually eat lunch together we would all

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,880
go out to lunch and talk about new

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
things and

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,480
you know just sort of form this bond

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,159
between technologists

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,760
that are super helpful

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,279
and again i want to point out like you

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,159
said rachelle uh

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,760
being an advocate for other people i

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
think that's very valuable because

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,279
a lot of times we're all just sort of

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,960
you know like we get down we get at our

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,159
desk we want to focus on what we're

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
doing

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
don't care about you know what's going

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,440
on in the outside world

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,120
when by helping people in the outside

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,840
world you're also helping yourself

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,440
because

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,520
you're creating this network that will

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,120
you can support it and it can support

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,080
you

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,679
when you need it absolutely and and

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,679
going back to charlie and the choc

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,520
chocolate factory so the five kids that

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,080
found the golden tickets

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,360
instead of working together collectively

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,760
they worked on their own

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,039
individual interests and it turned out

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,600
to hurt them

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,559
in the shortfall it is important that we

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,440
remember

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,640
we are gifted to be technologists how we

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,360
got here

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,720
we got here but we are here and so as

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,279
you see the world change

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
in front of you it is incumbent upon

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,360
each of you to

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,880
find someone to bring with you it is

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,960
incumbent that you teach

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,039
others what you know whether you teach

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,559
them to a traditional class or whether

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,640
you have a cup of coffee

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,159
and you have a conversation with them

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,919
and one of the wonderful things about

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,240
juju is very very very

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,320
shy and and not very he doesn't brag

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
about himself but drew is brilliant he

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
really is and any of y'all looking for a

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,520
genius

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,799
drew is your guy but i'm sure duke

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,679
doesn't want to part with him

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,880
but it's important to have a jew in your

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,799
organization

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
someone who is willing to take his or

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,880
her time and bring

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,360
a technology to a group and have a q a

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,279
give an overview and then serve as a

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,679
resource if they're further questioned

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,440
so when github we first said github

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,880
joe is the person who brought github to

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,279
us docker

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
you know and all of these things drew

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,080
was responsible for bringing himself

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,080
and others to talk with uh the team and

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,799
actually do their 45 of us

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,000
you know and talk with us about what he

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,480
knows and what he

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
thinks is important for us to know and

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
that is

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,600
an example of a well-rounded

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,520
technologist it's not just he's in there

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,640
getting his paycheck doing the best job

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,559
he can get

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,919
and then saying oh well i can go home at

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,679
the end of the day but he's bringing

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,520
others along and it's important to bring

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,440
others along because as you've seen

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
in charlotte in the chocolate factory

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,720
the separation of those five children

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
and their parents

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
led to doom and only one succeeded

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,559
because he had a

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
giving sense to him as opposed to a

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,480
selfish or

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,039
i want only me to win kind of thing

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,960
i keep harping on underserved groups

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,840
because i think it's important for us to

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,039
understand

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,760
um i think i i can speak this for myself

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,760
but i think

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
for other black and brown people and for

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,399
some women in

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,919
in in i.t and stem we are severely

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,960
underrepresented

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,480
we are not paid equally we aren't

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
promoted equally

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,200
we struggle to find our voice and in a

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,679
lot of cases

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,799
these technologies that are coming along

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,520
are going to harm

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,600
these very same people so if you take

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
things like algorithms so if you live in

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,360
a certain

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,120
zip code there is a chance that your zip

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,399
code is going to be list

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,320
listed as high risk or crime written

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,640
or something so your insurance rates are

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,559
going to be more more you pay

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,919
these are all things that like open

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
source can address

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,279
we all know that there's bias in

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
technology you know there was a

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,200
discussion at duke

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,080
um a couple three weeks ago about the

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,399
terms and technology that are

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,679
racist if you will so whitelisted versus

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,799
blacklist that you know

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:34,159
or slave and master for a hard drive

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:37,279
to a cpu all of these kinds of words

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,320
the issues that exist deep inside our

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,480
society

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,480
come out through our our resources so

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,360
whether it's technology whether it's

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,320
uh housing all of those it makes itself

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,880
known

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,360
in various ways so it's incredibly

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,840
important that we understand

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,600
you know how important is to bring other

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,320
groups into the fold so that we aren't

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,120
creating

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,840
bias that that ends up hurting people

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,760
right so

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,440
you know and i talked about this

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,520
yesterday in my chat a little bit

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,200
but you all know google had their facial

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,880
recognition software and when it

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,559
encountered a skin tone it wasn't

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,799
familiar with it

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,440
produced a pitch of a gorilla that's not

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,840
google intending to be racist or harmful

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
that's

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
google only having a certain kind of

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,360
people

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,840
coding and creating these resources so

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,960
they code and do what they know

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,120
and as has been said many many times

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,480
the algorithms the automations the

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,960
robots the data

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,320
only produce what the people who created

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,320
it have enabled it to produce so if you

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,760
write code that has bias in it it's

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,120
going to have a biased result

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
if you write code that has

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
discrimination or racism in it it's

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,200
going to come out that way

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,840
we must focus on making sure that the

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,399
code

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,679
and the data and the automation is fair

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,399
creates a fair play for everyone

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
so absolutely i just wanted to add to

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,760
that like uh

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,880
one thing that we've been trying to do i

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,480
know like you know i've been in

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
technology for

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,919
20 or so years and like the master slave

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,640
uh

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,240
terminology uh blacklist and whitelist

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,039
that stuff is like

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,679
ingrained in our brains and until

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,720
recently

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,559
we'd never really pushed to change that

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
and i i would really encourage everybody

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,320
here to you know you probably have

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,799
products with whitelist and blacklist

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,159
master and slave in there and i think as

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,720
we try and

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,240
root that stuff out it really gives us

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,399
like uh

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
a couple advantages one you know it gets

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,200
that terminology

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,600
out of technology but the other thing

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,640
it gets people people talking about it

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,760
and it makes people

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,279
more aware of it and i think you know i

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
won't say which one is better i think

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
they're both very important but being

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,600
able to

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,919
bring it to people's consciousness and

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,399
say hey you realize you name this server

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
like

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,919
master and we've been naming it like

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,679
this for 20 years

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
maybe it's time we changed that and just

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,720
you know throwing it out there and

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,760
having people be aware that this is a

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,080
problem where

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,080
you know for years myself included we

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
just didn't think about that and

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,360
you know maybe it's maybe it's time we

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,519
do better and maybe it's time we

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,279
get that stuff totally out of technology

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
and there are much there are many more

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,440
words than just

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
those four that are that are in the

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,360
tools and i think that

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,559
you know as you think about the things

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,000
you're developing in the work that

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,640
you're working on you know

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
can you think about it in a more utopian

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,760
kind of way

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,200
and and the way i try to describe this

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,080
is like when you think about the

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,440
universe

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,000
you know the universe has a gazillion

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,480
trees

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
a gazillion flowers all kinds of bugs

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,159
and ants and stuff it's not just

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,159
one so why we are fixated on

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,200
something being better than another so

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,880
being white

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,480
being better than being black or being

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,679
latino or hispanic

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,760
or being asian that flies in the face of

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,279
the universe the universe is diverse

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,279
it's the most diverse thing

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,720
out there there's nothing more diverse

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,960
in my yard i have at least

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,519
11 different kinds of trees and they

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,519
seem to live very harmoniously together

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,360
they don't seem to be fighting one isn't

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,399
trying to kill the other one or stomp

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,240
out its roots

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,559
they're all right there doing fine

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,799
trying to see which of them is

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,760
staying closest to the sun but they live

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,919
together

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,679
harmoniously why can't we so

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,360
as you look at these slides i'm putting

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,399
in i'm happy to share them with you if

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,480
you like i will

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,399
send them to whoever wishes to have a

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,880
copy but you know and you think about

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,880
these things

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,080
what what you see here in this slide

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,480
right so you see

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,320
the disparity between groups right you

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
see the problem between groups

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,399
the slide i put up earlier you see what

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,679
the unemployment numbers look like right

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,799
so you see all these things

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,720
so as you are doing the work that you do

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,880
as you are thinking about the work that

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
you do you should be thinking about the

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,960
way to make the world better

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,000
and not to create separation and

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,720
dissension

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
because united is a very powerful word

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,520
and what jew does is he unites people he

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,639
brings people together

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,119
to unite around a common good and i

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,800
think that is such a rewarding thing for

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,200
us to do as a society

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
especially considering how much power we

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,480
will have

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,520
in the near term those of us that are

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
technologists will

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,399
have immense power being in demand

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,839
you'll be able to ask for whatever we

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,639
want to pay because

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
as these industries start transitioning

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,560
from

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,200
this to that we then get to a place

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
where we are

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,639
able to see a world that is a better

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,520
world for everyone we don't have people

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,280
that are hungry

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,639
we don't have gas shortages we don't

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
have people being evicted

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,000
we're creating a world where there is

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,520
you know

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,560
harmony and equality i'll say one other

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,320
thing

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,440
about women it is important it is

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,240
absolutely centrally important that

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,760
women be included in our thought

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,599
processes

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,800
because right now for every dollar a man

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,480
makes a woman makes 79 cents

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
that's the most illogical thing i could

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
ever imagine if you got the same

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,800
education same experience why are you

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,400
paid less

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,480
if we're doing it based on some agrarian

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,160
idea or some concept of what a woman

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,520
used to be we're not there and we need

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,240
to move forward with that

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,119
women code women design women work in

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,520
technology

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,480
and stem the whole nine yards we should

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,480
be paid equal

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,280
and i and and charlie and the chocolate

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,599
factory for me is one of those

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,320
kinds of pay attention kind of things

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,440
you know it's

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,720
something you need to think about

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,640
because charlie and the chocolate

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,320
factory although it's a kid's movie

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,800
you know it's not meant to be serious or

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,079
anything but it is certainly a prelude

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
to what's coming

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,160
and if you aren't aware you better start

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,079
looking out because it's coming

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
and it's coming fast so if you're

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
currently just screwing the top on the

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,160
the toothpaste they're going to find a

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,839
way to automate that and get rid of you

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,680
because what covett has told us more

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,520
than anything else any business that

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,400
could survive without humans

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,160
survived those essential workers were

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
essential and they are

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,880
you know experiencing trauma from covet

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,720
companies are going to sit back after

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,599
this is over and think how can we do

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,520
this better

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
and so all of you technologists and

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,280
designers and devops and scrum masters

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
and all these other people

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,040
you're going to be in this demand i hope

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,119
you will

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,280
design yourself to be equitable and

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,560
think about everybody fairly

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,200
uh i um i've done talking

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,440
all i want to talk about so drew would

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,440
you want to bring us home tell us uh

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,040
what we missed and what else we need to

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,280
know

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,359
so the only thing i wanted to uh to add

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,599
to what you said michelle is uh

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,440
again like thank you for all the com the

00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,760
compliments i am super humbled by that

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,440
and

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,440
really appreciate it uh

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,599
while i do feel like i bring a lot to

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,880
you all uh when you do these when you do

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,320
this sort of outreach when you go and

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,640
talk to people

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,119
it's very rewarding for the person doing

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,560
the outreach as well right like

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,000
sharing something like git lab or docker

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,520
for me that's pretty easy and it has a

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
big impact and that's great and the

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,160
thing that i really liked about

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,680
uh i will call it outreach is that

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
you get to meet people like rochelle

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
like rochelle i don't know if we would

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
have ever

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,960
uh met and formed this sort of

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,920
friendship if not for these

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,440
uh for these meetings and i feel like

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,960
that has paid off the

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,800
you know minimal amount of hours spent

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,560
doing outreach has paid off you know

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,920
by way more just meeting people like you

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,760
and everyone else in the group and

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,200
getting uh

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,440
getting a new perspective and i think

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,880
the new perspective is uh

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,480
is very important um when you talk about

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,400
uh making sure that uh women and

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,839
minorities have a seat at the table

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,839
i also want to add that like

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,359
it's not just the job of women and

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,079
minorities to get that spot at the table

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,880
a lot of times you know in our diversity

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,880
group at duke

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,400
one recurring thing that i hear is like

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
hey i was in this meeting with

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
leadership

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,640
and i was the only person that looked

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,560
like me at that table

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,839
and unfortunately like my thought is

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,200
like oh you should have been at the

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,480
meeting before then because you weren't

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,720
there and it was like

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,560
100 white men right like it's not uh

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,280
we can do a lot better like we need to

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,280
be diverse and it's not

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
i'll speak for i'll speak for white men

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,560
everywhere like

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
we need to be bringing people to the

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,920
table we don't need to

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
wait for people to force them away force

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,359
their weight to the table which is where

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,720
you know they deserve and have a right

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,560
to be so

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
if you're in meetings where you notice

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,720
it's not diverse

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,119
uh don't wait for someone else to do it

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,520
like

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,920
bring it up try and bring more people to

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,760
the table because diversity helps uh

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,680
helps everybody and it's it's very

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,960
important all around and

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
you know not just for the people that

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,119
have been

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,400
systemically kept down but it'll help

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
your group it'll help you be better

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,359
people it'll help you

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,079
bring new technologies to the plate and

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,760
it'll help you bring it'll help you uh

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,440
it'll give you ideas that your group

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,440
hasn't thought of before because

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,359
your group is not diverse exactly

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,280
so we have time for a few questions if

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,760
there are any

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,040
yes thank you um thank you dr newton

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,079
and thank you um for such an

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,720
interesting talk we have

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,440
a couple of questions i'm going to allow

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,359
brent

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,640
damingman to ask you a question if he

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,960
if he stood there um

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,960
all right

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,839
brent

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,280
all right so if print is taking time

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,520
let me read out the question from the q

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,520
a

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,040
it says how much of this can we

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,040
eliminate

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,520
by changing the social view that someone

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,400
is only entitled to food and shelter

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,599
if they have a job instead of advocating

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,440
for re-skilling and the state is secure

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,839
that the future of work is less about

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,839
survival but interest

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,520
so i i think that we we must

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,200
first try to dissect what we think we

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,119
are as a society

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,319
um so if we believe in a hierarchical

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
society

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,480
that something has to be better than

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,000
another

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,280
nothing we do in technology will be fair

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,240
nothing if we want

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:13,760
there to be a fair and equitable

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,440
industry ours is the one

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,839
because we know so much about our work

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,680
and what can and cannot be done in our

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,920
work that we must then

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,119
start to look at it and find the places

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,480
where we see

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,040
the dark spots and clarify those and

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,200
make it

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,520
clear that we don't want this to

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,280
continue we want to pay people we want

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,079
to bring people to the table

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,640
we want to when we hire we want to hire

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,560
not just

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,400
someone because of their color or their

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
gender or their sexual orientation

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,680
but because it brings something to the

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,839
table it makes

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,839
everyone at the table better

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,480
thank you one thing i'm sort of curious

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,760
about what you think rachelle

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,960
is that one thing that comes up at times

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,359
with automation uh is putting a tax on

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
uh robots that replace workers and i'm

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,599
curious if you had any thoughts on that

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,280
i wrote an article about this not too

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,400
long ago so um

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
someone said you know well robots is

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
free labor

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,119
and and it brought to mind enslaved

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,599
people right so

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,880
free labor you know so it's not

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,359
something i'm particularly comfortable

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,599
with

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,880
but i do think that companies that are

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,520
able to

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,560
think about their innovation in a way

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,359
that reduces costs for individuals

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,560
makes sound decisions in the way they do

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,560
it for example

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,400
application tracking systems i'm sure

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,359
everyone here has looked for a job at

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,680
some point in time

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,480
and if you it has been so in the last 10

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,359
years

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
they've been ats's and in ats is there's

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,920
so much

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,720
bias in ats's that it kind of dislodges

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,520
things so

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,359
if you are doing it fair i don't think

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,040
you should have a tax on a robot

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,400
i think you should have a tax if you

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,839
violated your rule

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,680
if you've done something that's been

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,280
harmful to a group you should have a

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,280
penalty just like they do

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,800
for people like microsoft when they're

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,200
cornering the market you know things of

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:16,720
that nature so

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,359
thank you you're welcome

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,240
thank you yeah let's see if you have any

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:27,839
more questions

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,839
or comments coming in

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,040
i still have time for one more question

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,960
if anyone attending wants to

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,160
quickly and quickly post your questions

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,160
for dr newton

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,920
well on behalf of juice dinner and

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,760
myself we would like to thank you very

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,520
much for listening to us and attending

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,240
our presentation

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,160
we are here um if you want to ask for

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,839
other questions or

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,560
do what's your handle on linkedin

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,960

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,400
social

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,480
media um i don't believe in that because

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,839
anything free is not necessarily good
