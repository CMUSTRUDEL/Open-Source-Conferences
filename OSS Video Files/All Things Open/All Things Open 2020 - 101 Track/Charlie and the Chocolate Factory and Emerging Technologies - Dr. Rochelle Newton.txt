Abstract: The current information/technological revolution has moved beyond academia and business.  For many, information technology (IT) was a black hole of mystery.  Today, technology is now a considerable component of our personal, professional, and social lives.

The Federal Government and post-secondary education spearheaded early advances in (IT).  IT did not become an acronym until 1978.  The initial adoption of technologies came in the form of computations.  Slowly organizations recognized the capacity of computing and Mooreâ€™s Law became the measure.  As technology evolved, computing staff developed into some of the roles that exist today.  Each decade the application and use of technology have increased.  As a result, the skills of non-technologists and technologists increased.  The diversity of career choices led to horizontal and vertical opportunities. 

Today, technology threatens IT and non-IT jobs. However, as emerging technologies have disrupted traditional technology, some jobs will expand and others will disappear.  Research suggests half of the current workforce will no longer be needed or new skills will be required. 

This presentation will discuss new careers in IT and augmenting the IT toolbag.  Advocation and mentorship may become the axiom of transformation.
