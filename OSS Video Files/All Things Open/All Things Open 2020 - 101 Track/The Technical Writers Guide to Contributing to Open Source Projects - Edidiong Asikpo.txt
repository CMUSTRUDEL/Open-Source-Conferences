Abstract: The documentation of an open source project provides an avenue for users to not only understand the project but also make contributions to it. Surveys (https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4008838/Resources/The-2019-Tidelift-managed-open-source-survey-results.pdf) have even shown that a good documentation saves as a sign of the healthiness of an open source project. 
 
However, technical writers still think they are not meant to contribute to open source projects because of the stereotype that only software engineers are meant to contribute to open source. 
 
In this talk, I will introduce the audience to how technical writers can contribute to open source projects, best practices, and itâ€™s benefits.

thank you everyone for joining

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,120
um like you already mentioned we're

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,639
talking about the technical writer's

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,360
guide contributing to

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,640
open source project so the documentation

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
of an open source project

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
serves as an avenue for users to

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
understand

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,519
contribute and also use that open source

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
project so these have also shown that

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,000
a good documentation serves as a means

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,079
of helping us it shows that all

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
this particular resource project is

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,840
actually healthy and people are using it

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
yet few open source projects can claim

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
to have

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
a good documentation right well the one

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
who managed to have

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
struggled to keep that documentation up

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
to date however there are also a lot of

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,320
technical writers as well

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
who will shy away from contributing to

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,719
open source project mostly because they

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
don't

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
necessarily understand how to or

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,520
they just don't think it's beneficial

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,039
for them to

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
or they're influenced with this

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,519
stereotype that only software engineers

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
can contribute to open source projects

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
this talk aims to give an introductory

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,479
guide into

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
how technical writers can contribute

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
open source it would cover

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
the state of open source documentation

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
um how to actually get started and also

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
cover some of the benefits and

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
best practices when contributing as a

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,439
technical writer

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
my name is eddie young asibo i work

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,200
a developer advocates for hashnode and

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,119
contributes to

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
the leaderline open source organization

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,560
as a technical writer

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,560
it is really possible that everybody

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,479
who's attending this session has

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
an idea of what an open source project

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,240
is but i just want to highlight it

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520
because i feel

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
most of the time whenever we're talking

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
about open source projects we're always

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,240
focusing on

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
the source code side of things but i'd

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
love to see an opponent or

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
describe an open source project as a

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
project whose source code and

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
documentation not necessarily just the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,079
source code

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
but the source code and documentation

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,840
are made available for use

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,880
modification and enhancement by anybody

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
in the world

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
if you can look at my slide you see that

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
i really highlighted anyone

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
which goes for that say that no you

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
don't have to be a software developer to

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
contribute open source

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
technical rights can contribute um

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
program managers can contribute

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,879
designers can contribute open source so

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
pretty much anybody who is a trusted

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,840
contributor to open

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,520
sound open source project in 2017

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
github carried out the survey to

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
understand some of the issues that

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,239
people were facing in open source

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
projects right so

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
reaching out to like maintainers

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
designers technical writers

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
to understand some of those issues and

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
try to work on them and as you can see

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,800
some of the issues raised were

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
incomplete and confusing documentation

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,280
unresponsiveness dismissive responses

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
conflict unexplained rejection and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,040
unwelcoming

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
content on welcoming language or content

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,840
so just to break down down a bit

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,280
this survey was um was about like

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
five thousand five hundred people

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
responded to the survey right

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
and also those thousand five hundred

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,120
people 90

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,640
percent of them complained that

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,319
the documentation was income confusing

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,200
so this the fact that 90 out of 500

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
people said

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
the same thing about open source

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
documentation goes to say that this

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
is actually a problem everybody's

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,120
complaining about not either

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
finding confusing documentations or not

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
even seeing an existing documentation at

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
all

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,239
right so this this for that to say that

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
the documentation of an open source

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,040
project

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
is arguably as necessary as the software

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
therefore technical writers are also as

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
important as software engineers because

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
nobody will use what they don't

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,360
understand

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
so i'll give an example let's i

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,959
used a really interesting open source

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,319
project a really interesting product i

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,159
make it open source without

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,760
it writing any form of documentation or

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,519
wiki like nothing whatsoever

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
and put it on my github if someone

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
eventually bumps into that project

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
they would not have any idea like they

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
wouldn't know what to do right so it

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
pretty much means that everything that

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
i've worked on

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,560
just goes to waste right so people need

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
to understand what you

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
build you what you want them to do in

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,519
order to be able to do it effectively so

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,159
that is why

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,560
um technical writers are important in an

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,479
open source in an open source ecosystem

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,479
because when technical writers come on

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,160
board to contribute to open source

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,280
become more active in the open source

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
ecosystem

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,759
they would know how to actually

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
contribute effectively

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,199
and also that you contribute

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
so now that you understand the state of

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
open source and then you've also seen

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,840
why technical writers are important

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
because if technical doesn't exist or

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
don't contribute to open source

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
it's either one of two things the open

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
source projects would literally not have

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
any documentation or

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
if they try to work on the documentation

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
it becomes confusing

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
because they don't necessarily have the

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,840
skills to document

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,880
things in a way somebody would

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,880
understand

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,960
so let's talk about how you can actually

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
create a resource project as a technical

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
writer

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
so the first thing you need to do is

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,280
find a project a lot of people would ask

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
okay hey how do i find a project as a

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
technical writer i feel like

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
you only find projects where you can

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
contribute via like maybe coding or

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,199
maybe designing

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
something even fun for design is a bit

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,000
hard but you definitely find

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
more coding coding questions right so

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
what i

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,720
say is it could be one of two ways and

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
i'll explain what the first one would be

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
to

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,120
think about things that you're

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
interested in are you interested in pie

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
touch for instance then you could just

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
go to github

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
and search for the word pie touch once

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
you search for that you see tons of

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
projects that are either using python or

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
prototype itself

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
and you can go to that project and

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
contribute to the project so this

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
because the reason why that is important

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
is because technical writers are

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
supposed to understand

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,479
what they're writing about right because

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
if you want to explain something to

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
someone

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,160
you need to understand it very well in

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
order to explain it that's like the

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
first world

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,120
the next one would be not necessarily

00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
restricting yourself to the things you

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
already know

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
but things you want to explore because

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
another important skill of a technical

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
writer is

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
to be able to make research right so

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,039
moving from not knowing

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,039
anything about a project or a particular

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,440
thing to understanding it well enough

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,280
to explain it to somebody else right so

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
you can now focus on that route like

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,520
hey i want to understand react for

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
instance so you can go to github and

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,360
search for react and see different

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
projects

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
so once you've found the projects you

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,520
want to contribute to the next thing you

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
need to do is

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
identify an issue to solve so when i was

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
explaining how to find a project

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
i didn't necessarily restrict it to okay

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
how to find

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
projects that already have documentation

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,360
because i feel that

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,039
we could also be poundians of those

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
documentations again

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
based on the survey that tons of

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,360
opportunities that do not have

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
documentation right

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
so when you're trying to identify an

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,319
issue chances are

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,000
if you um found a project where

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
you already have like an open source

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
documentation right all you need to do

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
is go to the repository

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,560
and then go to the top of the issues

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,960
find an issue you want to work on

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
um notify the maintainer about like your

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,680
interest in that issue

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
and then start working on the issue

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,599
right that's like for a case where

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
you find a document and a project that

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
has a documentation

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,720
but what if you you find or found

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,720
interest in a project that does not have

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
a documentation what do you do

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
you would naturally go through that

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
project maybe try to implement the

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
project or your laptop whatever

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,400
project it is right try using that

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
project and then as you're using that

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
project i'm sure there are so many

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
questions that you'll be asking yourself

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
but eventually you'd figure it out right

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
so when you figure out those things

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
documents down like the entire process

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,199
things you wish you

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
could read somewhere right because the

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,080
chances are when someone else wants to

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
come to use that project they're still

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
asking themselves the same questions

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
right

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,400
so you could be the person who pioneers

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
documentation in that open source

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
project

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
so don't restrict yourself to trying to

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
contribute a project that already has

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,000
like a structured documentation like

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
flow right you could start to

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
start up another one right because i

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
feel like once we keep doing this as

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
technical writers

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,120
it ensures that more open source

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,960
projects are documented so the next

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
survey that github will carry out 90

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
people will not complain sorry 90

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
percent

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
or 5 500 people won't complain about the

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,120
same issue again

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,879
so once you've been able to identify an

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
issue and i start working on the issue

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
the next thing you need to do is submit

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,960
a pull request if you're using github

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,639
or you're using a git lab it's called

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,800
the magic crest

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
so another important thing to take note

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
of here is

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
that most open source organization have

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
like certain flows in which they want

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,279
you to submit their pro request

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,719
so instead of just like um sending in

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
your comments and just

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
um creating a pull request they want you

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
to follow a certain flow rate

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
so it could mean um explaining what you

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
did in that pool

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
in like the pull request what you did

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
how it's going to affect the project or

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
having to

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,720
improve the project in any way so always

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
try to understand the flow of that open

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,959
source organization

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
and use that flow if the open source

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,320
project does not have

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
any form of guide or pull request you

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
could be that technical writer who

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,680
decides to do that

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
because if an open source project

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,600
doesn't have that

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
it means that anybody can can submit the

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,480
pull request in different ways it does

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
not bring structure to the organization

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
so always see from a perspective of

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
oh hey if i find myself in a place where

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
i can contribute to a documentation that

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
already exists school

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
but if it doesn't can't i be the person

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
who says oh i'd love to take this up and

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,880
let me bring in more technical writers

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
to contribute to the opposite

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
project so these are some of the best

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,040
practices you need to understand

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,880
you don't necessarily have to follow

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,399
these best practices but it's just

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
something that will

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,680
definitely help you as you're

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
contributing

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,560
so the first thing would be to follow a

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
style guide if you exists because

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
not all open source organizations will

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
have style guides right so it's

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,240
important to try to follow a style guide

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,920
so most most of them would have so if

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,760
they do have follow those ones

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
but if they don't you could also be the

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
person who says oh hey let me create a

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
style guide

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
for this open source project or you

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,360
could probably use like google style

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
guide or microsoft style guides

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
i know those two style guides are really

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,399
good for like the developer community

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
and the tech community

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,240
but i'm sure there are tons of other

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
like good and effective style guys so

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
try to use any of those ones that work

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
for you

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,640
and um another thing would be to

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,200
um ensure that the page title should

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,360
always reflect the content of your page

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,040
so if you're writing something about um

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
let's see how to use scroll trigger

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,640
plug-in and react that's like the title

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
so the contents of your page should not

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
be about how to

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
maybe and react and work with the dom

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
right because who doesn't know what the

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,959
reader wanted to see so whenever you

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,079
write a title the content of that page

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
should

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,240
be in line with what the title is

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
because if i come to read a certain

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
documentation certain article

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
the reason why i clicked on a particular

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,839
one because i found that

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,880
interesting or i want to solve that

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
certain thing

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
so ensure that you follow that style

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
guide

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,120
or rather you ensure that i follow your

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,279
contents the way

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,600
or works with the page so to speak the

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,240
next one would be to always define what

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
the page is about in the first paragraph

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,040
this is really important because i've

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,240
seen so many

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
technical articles so many

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
documentations that don't do this so

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,200
most people just go to

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
explain maybe explaining a concept

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,120
immediately without giving the

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
reader an overview of what you want to

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
talk about so for instance i come to

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,160
read an article about

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,920
getting started with dumb i want to

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
understand hey why is the job important

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
why do i need to know those things what

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
is this article covering in the

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
introduction before i even scroll

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
through

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,640
the article so always ensure that at any

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,760
time school you write or any

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,120
documentation you write for an open

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,639
source organization

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
not just another organization like in

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,120
your work generally to try to explain or

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,079
define what the entire page is about in

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
the first paragraph

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
so once i read the first paragraph i

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
should already know what this

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
um like what this document is going to

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
talk about without

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
necessarily scrolling through every

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
single thing and the next one would be

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,760
to consider your audience when creating

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
content

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,639
so like you already know we have

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
beginners we have experts who have

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
intermediate

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,040
people who have never contributed to

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
open source before people who

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,760
just who just joined tech like yesterday

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,760
so always try to consider those people

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
whenever you're writing documentation

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,200
because there's a possibility that

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
someone who just

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
um decided to give open source

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
contribution to try may come to media

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
documentation and if it is not easy

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,079
enough for them to understand

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
then the means would either stop they

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,040
would either not contribute to that

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
project or go to another one

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,880
or just stop contributing at all i mean

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,800
i've definitely gone through

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,160
a couple of open source projects and i'm

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,680
like okay

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,519
what am i doing like what do i have to

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
do and it just makes you tired so you

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,959
just move to the next one right

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
so i hope you can see how technical

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
writers can help

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,000
make the opposite ecosystem better

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
because when

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
anybody comes to an open source project

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
and it sees that your resource project

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,279
has like

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
effective documentation every single

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
thing is like clearly

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
spelled out i mentioned it helps them

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
understand and know like

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,519
the right things to do at the right time

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920
the right way to contribute

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,920
the right people to reach out to and it

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,720
just makes them feel welcome to the open

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
source project

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
organization generally and then the

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,560
final important one is

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,240
avoid duplicating content i mean it's

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,279
exciting to contribute to an open source

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
project but

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,959
always try to ensure that you're not

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,839
repeating something that's already been

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,639
documented

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,800
which goes further to speak about the

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
act of researching as a technical right

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
try to research is this thing not

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
somewhere else like do you just want to

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
document i want to help to improve that

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,199
project

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,800
so try to do the necessary research to

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
understand or identify

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,480
if this content you want to create

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,480
already exist to avoid duplicating it

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,519
okay because my laptop is hanging for

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,519
some reason

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,199
all right one second

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
sorry is it moving about there because

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
it's probably not moving

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,880
no i'm not seeing it move on oh

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
there you go okay i think it's okay okay

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,199
okay thank you

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
okay all right so um yeah

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
so these are the benefits of

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
contributing to an open source

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
project as a technical writer because

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
one of the reasons why people don't

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,079
contribute is because they're like oh

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,839
hey

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
it's free nobody's paying me to do this

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
so why do i have to stress myself to do

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
it right

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,000
so i'm going to highlight some of these

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,279
things here so the first one would be

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
that your technical writer your

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
technical writing skill

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
will improve tremendously i'll explain

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,160
why so in your writing

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,680
it's possible that you have access to

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
someone who helps you review your

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,160
articles or documentation before you

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,839
publish it

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
but if i'm not mistaken probably have

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
like maybe one or two people that help

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
you do that

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
just like a rough an average technical

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,199
writer has

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
one or two people who helped like that

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,920
would help hit your heart to

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,560
review her documentation or um article

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,440
right

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,199
but in an open source project you get

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,120
access to more people

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
not just people in your location people

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
who think like people like different

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
people across the world

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
so when there's like someone in so for

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
instance in nigeria right and then

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,279
someone in

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,959
the u.s with like a different perception

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,600
reviews my work and like that's

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
his or her own um like ideas to what i

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
should do right

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,040
it means that i now understand the

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,440
audience in the u.s right in

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
and in turn it's definitely helping me

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
be a better writer so i'm not just

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
writing to

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,720
only nigerians to understand but i'm

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,320
writing to nigerians and the us as well

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
so it helps you improve your writing

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
skill in diverse ways which i've never

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,519
really covered but

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
when you keep contributing you get like

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
a lot of views

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,680
you get to contribute more to open

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,279
source you get to explore more things

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,600
that you would have not explored if you

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,600
were writing alone so that definitely

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
helps to improve your writing skill

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
and then it also helps expand your

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
network when you contribute to open

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,120
source project

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
you meet a lot of people right so in my

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
case

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,199
working with uh video lan i get to like

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,279
speak with the president of visual

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,040
language speaking like different um

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,880
um developers and designers right these

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,480
are like relationships you're building

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
and these relationships can be really

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
really important in your career because

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,800
you really don't know where

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
this person would be there to like maybe

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,600
give you a recommendation

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
or share an opportunity with you or do

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,880
something for you to be honest so it

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,680
gives you an opportunity to expand your

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,959
network

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
and then it also gives you opportunities

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,440
to get recommendations and referrals

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,720
so um when i was trying to get the job

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
like some years back

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,920
um you know you're trying to get like

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,199
your first job people really want to

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,800
know okay hey why am i hired you don't

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
have any prior experience

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,079
but because i had prior experience with

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,199
contributing to open source projects as

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,600
a technical writer

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,360
i could say oh hey i contributed to a

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
media wiki i worked on your api

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,079
documentation

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
i did this and i did that i could see

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,400
that the

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,319
person who was interviewing me was

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
really excited and like

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,760
okay hey this girl knows what she's

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,880
doing this is me that has never worked

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,559
in any place right

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
so if i didn't contribute to open source

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
i'll probably just be someone who was

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,120
just writing

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
and they had like any experience working

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,880
with a real life project

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
so contributing to open source gives you

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,439
that opportunity to get like

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
recommendations

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,360
and if you ever want to apply to

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
something or like to any company

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,280
you could easily ask the person who is a

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
maintainer in the open source project

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,039
to write a referral for you right so

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
this is building relationship with

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
people who you would have not most

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
likely not met

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
and then even getting recommendations

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
from those people then the second the

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,600
last one is

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
you could also get accepted into the

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,960
season of dots program

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
so the citizen of docs program is an

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,799
initiative by google

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
to connect technical writers and open

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
source projects together

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,440
they also understood this problem of hey

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,799
we have tons of open source projects but

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,799
we don't really have a lot of technical

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
writers who are participating in this

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,799
project who are contributing to this

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
project

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,080
right so it gives you an opportunity to

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
do that and

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,360
one of the benefits of participating in

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,679
this program is

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
you they also pay you as well so you're

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,720
not necessarily saying oh contributing

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
to a person because it's free also get

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,799
paid

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
um ranging from like three thousand

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,840
dollars to 600 depending on your

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,039
on your location and you become an open

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,320
source contributor

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
to me this is like one of the

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
coolest benefits of contributing to open

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,600
source as a technical writer because

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
every technical writer contributes to

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,320
open source helps to debunk the

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
stereotype that

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,440
only software engineers can contribute

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
to open source so once you keep

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
contributing as a technical writer

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,440
you are helping more people see that oh

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
no i can contribute to like i don't have

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,960
to be

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
a software engineer or um like a core

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
maintenance contribute

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,679
you can also contribute to technical to

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,840
open source project as a technical

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
writer

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,000
okay i think there's definitely

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
something wrong with this screen of mine

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
okay the next session would i would just

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,880
give the conclusion

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
um if i'm not mistaken i don't know why

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
it's still not working

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
all right but in conclusion um since my

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,840
slide is not working

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
um the recommendation of resource

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,280
projects is extremely really important

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,240
it's what gives

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,520
a new user the existing users an idea of

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,919
what the project

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,440
is how to get started what they should

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,640
build why they should even be interested

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,720
in working on that project

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,919
or contributing to that product or even

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,440
recommending it to somebody

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,960
else so once you contribute to a

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
personal technical writer

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
you're not just improving your writing

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,679
skills or expanding your network you're

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,160
basically making open source projects

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,919
better

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,919
for people now people in the future

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,520
making it better for like your process

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
ecosystem are large because people

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,960
really need to understand

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
what they want to do for contributors

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
they need to understand how to

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
contribute for users you need to

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,160
understand how

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,520
to use for maintainers who just need to

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
understand like the flow of the product

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,799
so that is how

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,799
critical and important technical writers

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,039
are to open source projects

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,960
and i hope that you're able to learn how

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,880
to contribute to business project as a

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,000
co-writer and i encourage you to

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
find an open source project to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,720
contribute to it may not necessarily

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
have

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,799
the entire documentation figured out you

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,480
could be the person who pioneers that

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,919
and if you want to take it step by step

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
and join a project that already has it

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,640
figured out

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
that also completely fine as well just

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,200
follow the process of

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,600
finding a project that works for you um

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
identifying an issue and something to

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,120
pull requests after you work on the

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,240
project

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,760
thank you very much um

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
i'll be taking questions now

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
i'm great great great job that's i think

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,760
you you hit the uh

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,919
the comment of the day people can't

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,960
contribute to what they don't understand

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,440
i mean that's uh the the uh ninety

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,799
percent

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,919
stat i i believe i mean that's uh really

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,679
really a great topic

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,400
um we had uh

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,360
one question coming on the q a i'm not

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
sure if you saw it

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
um but this is from got a couple coming

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000
in first

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
is from pamela thomas um saying that you

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
mentioned there

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
there are many style guides to use what

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,159
is your favorite

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,120
or your go-to one yeah

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
so my goats is definitely google style

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,039
guide

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,120
google style guide is definitely more

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,799
like developer oriented like you could

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
definitely see things and understand

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
that

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,799
if you follow this style guide it's

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,120
we're not necessarily developer oriented

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,480
like tech oriented to be honest because

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,960
it's it's not the

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
normal style that you see it's something

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
that works for your target

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,520
audience and assuming you're pressing

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
integrity qr

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,880
i would say that is the best style guide

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,640
to use like in my opinion

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
the microsoft style guide is also really

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,320
great as well and i think

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,840
the microsoft documentation is one of

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,559
the better competitions i've seen like i

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,320
don't know who

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,080
built it but they are just like amazing

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,480
so but in the personal experience i

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
definitely prefer google style guide but

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
i would advise you either check google

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,240
or microsoft and pick the one that works

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
for you

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,640
okay great

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,520
uh the other question i'm not sure if

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,000
you see uh

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
alvin ridley asked do you think

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,840
contributing to the documentation

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,960
is a way to start in your development

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,200
journey

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,039
so by development journey referring to

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,679
as a software engineer or the technical

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,080
writer

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,520
i think yeah i think that's what what

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,120
you know like understanding

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,520
you know if you understand the technical

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,679
pieces and components and you're able to

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,799
express it to others you know what with

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,039
that like like

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,640
if you wanted to get into say python or

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,880
some language that you're not

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,559
familiar with yeah i wonder do you think

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,799
it would help you yeah

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,960
yeah i agree so the good thing about

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,760
being a technical writer or documenting

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
is you become a lifelong learner because

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
for you to explain something for

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
somebody to understand you need to

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
understand it very well

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
so when you're writing it gives you an

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,000
opportunity to learn more so i think

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,520
people have a perception

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
that you need to be like super smart to

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
write but that's absolutely wrong

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,799
you could research something you never

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,240
knew about and now write about it

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
in that process you're trying to teach

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,280
somebody you're also learning as well so

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
that would definitely

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
help to improve your development journey

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
that's a

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,840
yeah great great point

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,320
next from daryl cooley asking

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
do you have any good reference guides

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,919
for general technical

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,799
writing and documentation especially

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,440
with uh

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,640
when the larger uh target audience is

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,400
tech users

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
any any reference guides okay yeah so i

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
have

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,039
the answer i'll share i'll just drop

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,840
that in the chat some

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
um let me just try to goal that i have

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,960
like one i wrote an article where i

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,640
shared about technical writing

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
and i think the google's technical

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,080
writing cost is also amazing as well

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
and there are also a couple of other

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,840
resources so let me just drop that in

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
the chats right now

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:19,840
using a second

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
okay

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,159
oh i think i'm sending it okay

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,760
all right there we go yeah great thank

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,880
you

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,480
okay send a couple more to have like two

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
or three loadings that should be very

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
helpful

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
perfect

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,840
[Music]

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
yep

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,120
all right so this tooling should

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
definitely help you get started

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,799
google's technical writing course and

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,799
then also in my article and i actually a

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,919
couple of other resources there as well

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,720
which if you read through it you

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
definitely find it

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,200
great thank you thank you um

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,159
let's see uh there's another another

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,080
question here

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,559
um from lilly um how would you go about

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,000
researching um or how would you go about

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,200
searching for an interesting

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,840
open source project on github um or

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,919
or do you prefer to use uh you know like

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,159
search for a cool technology first

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
and then find the repository associated

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,240
with that

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,559
which here what do you do yeah so i yeah

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
like

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,919
i mentioned it's like two different ways

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,440
right so it's i think it's first trying

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,760
to understand which project which

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,080
technology you want to contribute to

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,279
is it it's a technique that you already

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,200
have experience with

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,279
or something you've just always wanted

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,720
to explore so if you're worries if you

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
already know that technology whatever to

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,480
explore

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,159
you could just go to google to um search

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,000
for it rather right just search for that

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,200
so it is react for instance

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,039
because every um github project is like

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,720
tied to like a certain

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,159
language or whatever of you so we take

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,320
it easily search for it

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
so um there's this good article that has

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
tons of open source projects that i can

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,840
contribute to a technical writer

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,480
so let me just quickly find it and send

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,480
it to you

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,120
um but i mean you could also contribute

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,279
to vlc as well

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:07,840
so just in a second let me try to find

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:07,840
that article insanity

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:21,840
that's a technical writer

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,559
okay i've just dropped it in the oh i

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,000
think i'm starting to just break

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,200
let me try to find the right one okay

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,039
so i just dropped it in the chat um if

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,159
you click on that list you see a list of

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,440
open source

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,440
um different open source products they

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,760
can contribute um contribute to the

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,520
technical writer but i think ideally is

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,640
understanding what you want to do

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
do you want to contribute to something i

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,840
already have experience with then you

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
could just go to github and search for

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,279
it

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,799
you also want to contribute something

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,360
you don't have experience with i'm sure

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,440
you know

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,559
technology you just still go there and

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
search for it as well

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,919
and always keep in mind that some of

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,799
these projects may not necessarily have

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,799
a good documentation right or any kind

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,880
of flow in terms of contributing

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,279
in the documentation perspective so you

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,360
could be the person who recommends that

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
right but if it does have the

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,640
documentation

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,640
um process of documenting or

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:39,919
contributing right it could just pick an

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:39,919
