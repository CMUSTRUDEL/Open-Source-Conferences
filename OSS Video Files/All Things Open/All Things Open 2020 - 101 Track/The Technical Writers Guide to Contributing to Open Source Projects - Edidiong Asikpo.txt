Abstract: The documentation of an open source project provides an avenue for users to not only understand the project but also make contributions to it. Surveys (https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4008838/Resources/The-2019-Tidelift-managed-open-source-survey-results.pdf) have even shown that a good documentation saves as a sign of the healthiness of an open source project. 
 
However, technical writers still think they are not meant to contribute to open source projects because of the stereotype that only software engineers are meant to contribute to open source. 
 
In this talk, I will introduce the audience to how technical writers can contribute to open source projects, best practices, and itâ€™s benefits.
