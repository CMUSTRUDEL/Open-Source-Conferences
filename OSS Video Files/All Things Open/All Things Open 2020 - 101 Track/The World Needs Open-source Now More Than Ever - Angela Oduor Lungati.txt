Abstract: COVID-19 has wreaked havoc at an unprecedented scale. Ushahidi has been used for nearly every global crisis in the last 12 years. Since March 2020, there's been an exponential increase in the use of its open-source platform from communities self-organising to provide mutual aid, documenting COVID-19 testing experiences, and creating visibility on where to access essential resources. Drawing from Ushahidi's experience, Angela will underscore the vital role open source plays in global pandemic response, and get us thinking about what role it should be playing in detection and response for the future.
