Presented at All Things Open 2020 - 101 Track

Abstract: COVID-19 has wreaked havoc at an unprecedented scale. Ushahidi has been used for nearly every global crisis in the last 12 years. Since March 2020, there's been an exponential increase in the use of its open-source platform from communities self-organising to provide mutual aid, documenting COVID-19 testing experiences, and creating visibility on where to access essential resources. Drawing from Ushahidi's experience, Angela will underscore the vital role open source plays in global pandemic response, and get us thinking about what role it should be playing in detection and response for the future.

um

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,599
hey everyone it's definitely a pleasure

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480

at all things open yet again i've i've

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
definitely

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
i would definitely have loved to have

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
been there in person in raleigh but

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,199
nonetheless i'm grateful for the

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
opportunity to

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
participate virtually and want to send a

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
big shout out to todd

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
uh dany and the whole ato team for

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,880
making this happen

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
my name is angelo nogati i'm the

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,079
executive director of a non-profit

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
technology company

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,719
based in nairobi kenya that builds open

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,239
source tools that enable communities to

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
respond to critical events

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,000
and support them to leverage technology

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,399
to fight for social justice

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
in their communities i like to think of

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
myself as a technologist

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
an open source software advocate and a

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
community builder who's passionate about

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
building

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
and using appropriate tech uh to create

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
impact in the lives of marginalized

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
groups

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,000
so today i'm going to be drawing on

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,840
insights from the work that we've

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
we and along with our community have

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
been doing on covet 19

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
just to think about the critical role

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
that open source has played in

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
responding

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,560
into this pandemic and what it can do to

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,560
help us prepare for what's to come

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,720
the world health organization declared

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,720
kobe 19 at pandemic on march 11 2020

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,000
and by this time more than 4 000 people

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
were dead and

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
more than 14 114 countries are confirmed

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
cases of the disease

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,360
i remember seeing people wearing masks

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
while traveling at the airport and

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
thinking

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
okay it's serious but it can't be that

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
bad

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,479
and then boom we went from zero to a

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,159
hundred

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,159
governments around the world instituted

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,880
restrictions to cut the spread

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
um kenya had its first confirmed case on

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,759
march 13th

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
and a few days later we shut down

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
schools pubs were closed

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
gyms are closed and a duster don coffee

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
was also imposed

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
nationally i think the story is likely

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
the same in many parts of the world if

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
not was

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
and as time progressed several problems

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,799
became apparent

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
one there were substantial information

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,840
informational gaps

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
scientists and doctors didn't know

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
enough about the disease and its effects

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
or how to treat it

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
it was difficult to identify hot spots

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
not only for governments but also for

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
citizens

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
and people didn't know where to access

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
protective you know personal protective

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,720
equipment

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
and of course in a vacuum of credible

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,040
information misinformation thrives

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
giving rise to the covey 19 for damic

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,800
such as what you're seeing on your

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,680
screen right now

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
second while lockdowns may have been

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
effective in slowing down the spread of

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
the disease

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
they had far reaching social and

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
economic effects on citizens

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
people have lost their jobs vulnerable

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
and high-risk communities have been

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
unable to get

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
access to information and critical

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,879
resources and of course as governments

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
have instituted curfews police officers

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
have taken that as an opportunity to

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
hammer down on citizens

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
in my country kenya the kenya the

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
independent policing oversight authority

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
which is the only authority that can

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,680
hold the police force accountable

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,400
has received 87 complaints since the end

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
of march

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
documenting more than 21 cases where

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
people have been killed

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,840
most of all governments around the world

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
have had limited capacity to respond to

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
a crisis

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,720
at the scale healthcare systems were

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
unable to respond to increased demand

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
for testing services

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,319
and there were limited resources to

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,840
handle critical cases even

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
in icus so local communities sprung into

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
action

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
with ushahidi my company having been

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,760
used in nearly every global crisis since

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
2008 we were overwhelmed with requests

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,799
from support

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,159
requests for support from all over the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
world all coming in

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,280
at the same time since march 2020

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,720
ushahidi's open source crowdsourcing

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,680
platform has been deployed more than

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,920
150 times in 116 countries

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
by grassroots organizations and

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
community actors

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
seeking to understand the pervasive

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,480
impact recovery 19

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,720
and also creating visibility into where

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,680
to access critical resources

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,040
and services fill informational gaps for

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
official response

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
and hold governments accountable for any

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
shortcomings and responding

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,639
to the pandemic i'd like to dive in into

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,479
two powerful examples

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,080
um shortly so one of the first ones is

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,560
um frana franco um

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
by the time a national lockdown was by

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
the time spanish authorities imposed a

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
lockdown on

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
march 14th all 50 provinces in spain had

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
confirmed cases

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,320
and on the 25th of march that death toll

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
surpassed that of mainline

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,759
mainland china coming second to italy's

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,199
at over 3

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
400 people a group of volunteers

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
entrepreneurs activists social

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
organizations

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
makers and the public as well as open

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
innovation labs then

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
partner to provide useful online

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
resources as well as my

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
public services around the citizens

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,479
using ushahidi to flatten the curve

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,160
initially the project started off as a

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,039
forum where these volunteers could come

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
together and

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,080
you know collect a repository of where

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,160
critical resources are create this

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
information and you know just brainstorm

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
around ideas of how to provide these

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
services to the general public

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
but eventually it evolved into a map

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
that

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
connected people who needed help with

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,479
volunteers

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
to date they've collected more than 10

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
000 reports

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
and have donated over 28 000 mass to

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
spanish people

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
all of those dots that you're seeing on

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,120
the map right now is either you know

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
someone saying that

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
i i don't have groceries or i need help

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
and you know being able to get

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
to get connected and i think the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
beautiful thing for me

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,240
is that they've not only been supporting

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,479
people in spain

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,520
but now they're also sharing their

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,360
expertise they've

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
built a model that they've been able to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
replicate in

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
22 other countries around the world so

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,039
there's 22 other frena la corvas

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
out there in this world a couple of

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,639
countries just to name them

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,160
portugal costa rica ecuador chile

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,919
mexico uruguay bolivia argentina

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,400
colombia france peru venezuela brazil

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,400
guatemala germany and poland

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,919
and this is all from the work that they

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
started you know they

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
they created training manuals they've

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,039
funded

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
activities and media campaigns and all

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,000
of that and the support team all of

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,000
these other different countries to

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
try and do the same thing and support

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,919
their own communities

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
now let's move on to the second case

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,919
study which is you know

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,759
documenting covert 19 testing

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,639
experiences globally

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,400
um who's director general has time and

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
time again impressed upon governments to

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
test

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,720
test tests noting that this has been the

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
key to saving more lives

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
and while there's been a marked

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,880
improvement in testing capacity

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
many countries are still not conducting

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
enough tests

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
china has of course been leading that

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
part i think the reports of them having

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
hit more than

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
uh four or maybe five million tests in

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,759
july this year

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
what you're seeing on the screen right

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,560
now is a snapshot from our world in data

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
um that you basically picked out

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
information from

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,800
any country that had this information

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,240
publicly available

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,800
and as of march 13th 2020 according to

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,599
the publicly available data sets

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
the uae united arab emirates was leading

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,319
in testing capacity

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,400
conducting i think eight eight covet 19

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,599
tests per 1000 people

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,840
right as of october 9th 2020 i think

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,919
only five countries aside from china

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
have been running more than 500 covered

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,599
19 tests per thousand people

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,639
that's luxembourg which is at a 1388.

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,599
the united arab emirates that is at 11

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,680
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:51,199
but rain is at 915 denmark is at 751

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,319
and singapore is at 525.

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,520
in africa morocco south africa

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,520
and namibia are leading with 77 74

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
and 43 tests per 1000 people

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,840
respectively

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
my country can is still at around 10

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,840
tests per 1000 people now one thing to

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
also remember is that at the onset of

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
the pandemic there are reports of people

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
being turned away because of limited

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,319
testing equipment

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
and in some areas it was just plain

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,120
expensive i think in kenya the report of

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
you'd spend probably about a hundred

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
bucks per cover 19 test

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,840
there's not that many people who can

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
afford that amount of money

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,919
safecast is a nonprofit organization

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,399
that was formed in response to the devas

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,719
the devastating japanese earthquake and

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,959
the subsequent meltdown of the fukushima

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,719
nuclear power plant in 2011.

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,000
they launched an ushahidi pod

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
crowdsource map to help people

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
around the world document the kobe 19

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,720
testing experiences

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
their goals provide credible information

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
based on first-hand experiences

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,040
to help inform government response

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,519
around the world as well as hold

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
officials accountable to citizens who

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,640
required

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,040
urgent assistance they've been helping

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,399
to put faces to the numbers and enabling

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
people around the world to tell their

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,920
stories

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,360
both harrowing and positive what you're

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
seeing on the screen right now is an

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
actual report

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
that came into the map this is somebody

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
who sent in a message about them

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
not being able to breathe they went to

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
the hospital or rather they they called

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
in and asked for

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
an ambulance and were told to call back

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,399
when it gets worse

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
at which point they could have been dead

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
or they could have been unconscious so

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
it just shows you the extent to which

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,680
people were suffering

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
uh while looking for covert 19 covet 19

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
tests so it was really important just to

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
create

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,839
um awareness around that and i'm sure

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,880
that there's many more like that if you

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,800
were to visit

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
if you were to visit their deployment

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,880
now there's so many more examples such

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
as these that demonstrate how open

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,720
source has played a critical role

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
in responding i think open source has

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
played a huge role in lowering barriers

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,640
of access to information and tech

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
it's encouraged information and

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
knowledge sharing and it's also enabled

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
wide scale uh engagement

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,279
however while this is commendable it's

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
you know it's amazing that you know

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
we can leverage the power of uh open

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
source to

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,079
you know figure out ways of responding

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,200
to problems in our communities

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,279
i've also been thinking about how we can

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
start to shift our strategies from being

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,480
reactionary and responsive

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,079
to preventative and being being prepared

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
there were warnings of pandemics

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,200
breaking out you know published in

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,279
reports spanning

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,120
decades decades and there's more than 1

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,440
400 known human pathogens that are

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
capable of causing disease breakouts

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
so it wasn't a matter of if but really

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
when

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
a pandemic would break out

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,560
now it's not lost on us that many of our

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
behavioral patterns

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
right now in responding to cognitive 19

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,279
are eerily similar to

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,320
historical pandemics for example the

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,160
spanish flu of 1918.

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
even then communities imposed

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
quarantines schools were closed

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
public gatherings were banned public

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
gatherings were banned and

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,920
citizens were asked to put on masks to

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,040
curb the spread of the fuel

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,200
anything sound familiar however

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,200
experts globally are lamenting the fact

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,519
that it doesn't seem like we're learning

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
from

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,800
previous outbreaks be it the spanish

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,760
influenza be it ebola be it aids or

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
cells

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,440
the spanish flu killed 50 million people

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
in two years

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
aids has killed 31 million people since

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
1981.

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
ebola's financial impact over three

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
years i think this this was

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,000
uh by report by the world bank in 2014

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,000
was estimated at

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,920
32.6 billion us dollars

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,519
yet here we are seven months into a

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
global pandemic that has killed more

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,720
than one million people

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
in that it's threatening to have a

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
disastrous impact on the worldwide

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
economy

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,440
and is unraveling years of progress that

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
has been made that has been made

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,680
in trying to bridge the gap you know

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,480
right now it's exacerbating inequalities

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,720
in low

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
and middle income communities so we have

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
to ask ourselves

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,560
where's the gap why is it that our

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,079
governments are unprepared to handle

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,240
disease outbreaks despite

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,120
years of scientific research

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,200
recommendations from previous epidemics

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
why is it that our current you know our

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
existing social protection programs are

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
inadequate to shield citizens

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
despite having experienced similar

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,600
economic impact in years that are passed

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,959
with

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,720
with other outbreaks now

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,000
this might be a controversial thing to

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
say but

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
the there are also several reports that

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,200
have been merged that have shown that

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,800
china suppressed information regarding

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
sas for nearly six months

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,639
during the outbreak uh a few years ago

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,079
and that the same thing likely happened

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
with the kobe 19 outbreak

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
that they kept quiet for over a month i

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
have to ask myself if the world would

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
have found out about this sooner

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
if internet freedom wasn't an issue for

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
the chinese population

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
china's internet censorship is said to

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
be more advanced than in any

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
other country in the world does this

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
make a case for fighting for internet

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,760
freedom around the world or

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
promoting freedom of speech and

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,839
embracing platforms that empower

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
ordinary citizens to tell their stories

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
internet freedom and access are

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
definitely critical in enabling that

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,920
free flow of information and promoting

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
freedom of expression

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
and i think that we can use that as a

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,240
tool for preparedness

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,079
however we surveillance is not the only

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
blocker to access we also have to look

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,200
at the cost

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,959
cost is also a substantial contributing

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,880
factor i think in many

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,079
probably even in my last presentation at

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
all things open i mentioned the fact

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,279
that there is a

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,800
pent up demand for the internet but many

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
people in the global south still can't

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
afford it and so

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
we have to ask ourselves what are some

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
of the things that we can do

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,279
now whether it's infrastructure

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
development or partnerships or

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,240
you know what are some of the things

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
that we can do to try and bridge that

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
gap and make the internet

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,959
accessible to everyone around the world

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,279
regardless of the financial ability

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,839
award tools um that they have access to

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,600
now platforms like humanitarian data

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,360
exchange and our world in data which i

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,920
referenced before have also been very

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
useful

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,320
in helping many of us understand the

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
pervasiveness of this pandemic

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
aggregating and visualizing datasets

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
from countries that have made this

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
information

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,399
uh publicly available but still

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,320
covet 19 has magnified the gaps that

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
exist in enabling efficient sharing of

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
data

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
and specifically around health between

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
global health actors

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
um i think what we're seeing now is that

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
you know we have individual health care

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
systems whether it's at local regional

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
and

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,959
national levels that are all capturing

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
their data in different formats and it's

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320
taking so much

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
time for them to integrate this and

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
extract the learnings that can be shared

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
across other systems

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
i think one of the things that we need

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,120
to do is invest in building

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
interoperable data exchange systems

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,199
especially in the health sector

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
not only at local and national levels

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,040
but also

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,959
at a global scale however more needs to

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,360
be done to strike a balance between

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
building robust data sharing systems as

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,480
well as maintaining digital

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,160
privacy rights now i know i've posed

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
quite a number of questions as opposed

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
to giving answers and that's because

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,279
i don't think i have i i don't have the

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,440
answers to everything

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,120
mine was more to you know throw that

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
challenge to us as members of the open

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,120
source community to start thinking about

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
how we can prepare for the next pandemic

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
because it's going to happen

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
right whether it's in our generation our

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
children's generation

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,360
you know we need to start thinking about

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
the things that we can do now that will

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,959
then help

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,240
others um learn whatever i've

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
said before is definitely not a

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
conclusive list and um

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,079
you know again i don't think that i have

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
all the answers but

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,399
i do think that we have a huge

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
opportunity as an open source community

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,880
to

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,639
start thinking about the ways to support

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,000
preparedness efforts and start doing

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,399
that now

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
open source has always been heralded as

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,639
you know being the giants on whose

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
shield as

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
many people can stand on i think now is

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,560
a time

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,279
for us to show the world how strong of a

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
giant

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,360
uh we actually are i want to thank you

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
all so much for your time and your

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
patience i'm hoping that this has been

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,720
useful just to spark

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
um some ideas around how we can start to

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,759
prepare but then also just reminding you

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
of what the power

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,560
uh open source has been responding to

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
different crises

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,160
i'm happy to take any questions that you

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,000
may have at

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
at this point thank you all so much

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
thank you angelia really an interesting

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
talk

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,040
especially covering everything that we

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,000
are seeing

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,000
today with kovy thank you thank you for

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,160
that

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,560
yeah we have really good time for

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,720
questions i'm gonna wait here

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,399
um so attendees if you have any

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,759
questions

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,360
angela is ready to take

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440
they can also be comments if you have

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
any comments um just you know let

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
we can do this with another an engaging

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,040
discussion for sure

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,799
i see one comment coming from justine

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,959
saying talking about some issues that

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,240
you you were talking about

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,400
that spacex is already addressing

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,559
uh okay there's a question in the chat

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,280
so how did privacy and other regulations

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,199
affect your work

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,880
right so i think the just given when you

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,559
look at the origins of

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
of shaheed and some of the areas where

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,840
it spins um you know it's it's

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,919
hardly been used around human rights

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
protection crisis response and there's a

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,679
huge recognition of the fact that we

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
are working with very vulnerable

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,679
communities so privacy has always been

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
central and key to the work that we're

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,440
doing um we have

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
you know a duty of care to protect the

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
identity of our sources and make sure

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
that we're not

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
putting them in harmful situations or

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
exposing them to

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,360
a retribution by different parties so i

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
i don't think that it's really had

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
um that much of an impact because those

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,160
are all mechanisms that we'd set in

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,080
place before you know making sure that

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,480
we are gdpr compliant

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
um making sure that we can allow for

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,200
anonymous reporting

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,640
um and you know doing a lot of education

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
through our support services and through

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
our community

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
a lot of education to people who are

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
deploying the tool to think about

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
the kinds of data that they they are

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,919
collecting why they need it and how best

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,919
to make sure that they are

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,840
adhering to ethical standards when when

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,840
working with the data

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:43,840
thank you for that

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,280
while you are ready for other questions

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
let me ask you if

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,679
are you currently in kenya you said yes

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,760
i am currently in nairobi uh in nairobi

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,760
in canada it's about 7 48 p.m

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
how are everyone going around you with

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,320
kobe

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,280
um i mean we're doing as best as we can

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,039
i think we're

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,400
probably being hit by a second wave

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
currently um so

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
we're expecting a new set of

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,799
restrictions to hit us uh

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
very soon um i can see another question

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,600
coming in from our good friend michael

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,520
downey

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,799
um do you so becoming a tech platform

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
that could be used across many

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
governments and civil society

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,440
organizations seems challenging

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,960
besides privacy as mentioned do you see

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
other challenges that communities should

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,039
focus on

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,280
to be as widely useful as as possible

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,280
that's a very very interesting uh

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
very interesting question um

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,520
i think one of the other things

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,919
especially now um

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,600
is and i think i probably touched on

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
this a little bit towards

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
towards the end of my presentation um

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,480
when you look at

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,240
the risk the lockdowns

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,919
and you know restrictions and movements

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
and what's what that's done to people in

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,360
terms of the

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,039
social and economic status that has had

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,600
a ripple effect

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,360
in terms of what tools uh people have

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
access to or what or what they can

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,640
afford

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,559
and so while you know the world has been

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
moving and thinking about okay fine

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,799
schools are closed can we move towards

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,679
e-learning and you know homeschooling

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,120
and all of that

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
the reality is that there's many

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,760
communities out there who

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
cannot they they might have access to a

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
smartphone or

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,799
those tools but they can't afford the

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,679
internet right or it might be a case of

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,000
there being

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,760
five children in one household with with

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
only one mobile phone and so

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
one thing that we've as a shahidi and

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,880
even myself personally

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
have been trying to think about and

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
really advocate more of is

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
making sure that we have a good

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
understanding of our audiences

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,480
and the challenges that they may be

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,440
facing and optimizing and adapting

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
towards that

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,960
right so right now when we're looking at

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,240
the fact that people aren't able to move

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,559
around as often so

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
a lot of development organizations are

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,760
not able to go there physically

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
what are some of the other ways that we

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
can we can engage with some of these

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
groups

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,919
right you know um people aren't able to

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,880
access physical books are there

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,799
you know open platforms where that allow

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,320
for people to access some of these

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
some of these libraries and things like

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
that are we thinking about building for

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
offline access

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,320
um are we thinking about accessibility

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
in terms of language so

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,440
those would be some of some of the other

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,280
ones to

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,520
to think about so accessibility um

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,720
yeah accessibility and just thinking

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
about some of the

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:44,400
the exacerbating inequalities that copy

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:47,760
19 is exposing right now

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,799
all right thank you for that um

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,159
this comment from michael again good

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
points and food for thought

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,840
indeed is a center design continues to

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,840
be critical for open source

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
all right

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,320
it's around seven in the evening there

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
well i'm going to 8pm but it's fine i'm

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,159
used to this

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,600
when you work in a global thing that has

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
people across different parts of the

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,960
world

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,360
you have the time zone dances it is an

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,640
interesting one

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,760
yeah we are in raleigh

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,679
and this is around noon

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:40,080
in north carolina yes

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:44,159
we are on the east coast okay

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,919
let's see um so there's a comment based

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,240
on about time zone ending up being more

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,080
of a buyer than languages it feels like

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,840
honestly yes um

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
i mean

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,960
especially if you know especially with

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
right now with the realities of people

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
being able to participate virtually you

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
know it's been a challenge even for us

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,760
at shahidi how do you balance out the

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
times that people are available and when

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,919
they're not

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,159
you know is somebody going to be able to

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,840
wake up at midnight to jump on a call or

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,120
participate in a webinar

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,799
and and things like that um but

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,080
language still seems to be a really

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,120
really big one one of the challenges

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,880
that we should probably through to

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,799
ourselves right now even while

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
you know while having this are we

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
optimizing for people who are not

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,360
english speakers

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,360
right you know so i

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,960
i definitely do take that at that point

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
but language is still a really huge

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,840
barrier

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,480
i have a beautiful background and i i

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
keep looking at that i miss that

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,600
are you muted yeah

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
i was saying i i just made sure that

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
everything in my periphery was outside

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,440
so that all you're seeing is

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
the world behind me yeah and

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,840
yeah absolutely selena i definitely

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,840
agree with you

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,080
all right any other questions comments

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,279
of anyone i mean maybe it's even

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,559
um thinking about uh you know are there

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,080
any other challenges that i didn't

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,200
mention in the talk today

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,320
um or could we you know brainstorm and

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,840
start thinking about some of the other

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,320
things that we could be doing

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,320
uh to prepare as opposed to just just

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
responding

00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:01,840
thank you

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,559
oh that's a good one as a nonprofit have

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
i noticed any new challenges with

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,200
getting funded now that

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
covet has shifted priorities for donors

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,679
um

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,279
i would say yes yes and no i mean

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,960
just like with the refugee crisis the

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,159
moment covered 19 hit there's a lot of

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
donors who then

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,039
shifted their attention towards um

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,799
covered 19 response and funding some of

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,679
those some of those activities

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,120
but even even now i know that there's a

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
few of them that are thinking about

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
you know questioning some of the

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,480
nonprofits around um for us i think it

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,520
had

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,120
the opposite effect to be honest um just

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,760
because

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,159
we saw a sag in use of the platform

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,039
right

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,320
the the the need for the tool being

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,320
available to

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
people who are trying to respond to the

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,360
crisis was so much

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,440
you know was intense and so

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,760
the need for more resources to then come

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,000
in and you know support some of our work

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,960
has been evident and it's been

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,520
i i wouldn't say that it's been you know

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,039
too much

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,840
but we we've been able to get some

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,600
funding

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,440
just because of everybody who's trying

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,159
to focus on some of those activities and

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,919
the fact that

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,840
it seems like we're smack that we're

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
smack in the middle of it

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,640
but i i also do comment that i've been

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,080
seeing a lot of you know whether it's

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,120
private foundations and philanthropic

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
organizations

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,200
um as well as governments just trying to

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,520
think of ways of cushioning

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,880
um businesses nonprofits tech

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,640
organizations from

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
from from the impact so as much as you

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
might not be working directly

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
on response or preparedness it's

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,240
thinking about just you know

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
it was the social protection programs

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
that i was talking about before

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
so i think the expectation was that you

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,880
know the the funnels would be completely

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,840
closed but

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,840
they haven't they haven't

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,320
let's hope that that that get changed

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
and then you get

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
some good new funding

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,520
crossing thank you michael

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,840
all right

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,039
uh angie is that influx of funding and

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,640
interest continuing and

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,880
fund is staying engaged or do we see it

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,480
as a one-time thing initially i thought

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
it was a one-time thing but then

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,279
like i said before i think covered 19

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,640
has come in and we likely have

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,480
far-reaching effects that will be fought

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,919
for years to come so

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,000
at the very beginning it was really

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,360
focused on responding but then now

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,679
there's a bunch of other things that are

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,240
coming up whether it's some of the

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
concerns or issues around human rights

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,399
protection

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,320
whether that's surveillance by

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,039
government or police brutality and all

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
the

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,159
other protests um as i mentioned before

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,559
as well these

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,240
you know inequalities are really being

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,760
exacerbated whether it's a poverty

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,640
levels and things like that

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:19,120
so it might just be a case of the

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,720
the nature shifting a little bit but

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
this is this is probably going to be a

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,679
thing for a long time to come because

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
there's a lot of progress that has been

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,080
made

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
that we've been set back and we need to

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,080
figure out a way of of catching up and

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
that's directly connected to copy 19.

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,760
so i expect that to be more programs

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,120
from people really just trying to invest

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,799
in

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,480
getting us back to to a sense of

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,360
normalcy and dealing with the effects of

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,159
coordinating

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,640
at least up until we get a vaccine so

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,000
right now

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,159
i can't see an end to it just yet

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,520
i can actually allow celine to answer if

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,039
she

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,840
