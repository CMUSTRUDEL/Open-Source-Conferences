Abstract: Much of our work is a process of problem-solving. But for whom are these problems being solved? And are they the best problem to solve? In this session, we'll take a look at the different ways we can identify the core needs of whoever we're solving while ensuring we maintain a space for innovation and idea generation. We will explore a few different frameworks and mental models to ensure you leave this workshop with tools you can immediately leverage in your work.
