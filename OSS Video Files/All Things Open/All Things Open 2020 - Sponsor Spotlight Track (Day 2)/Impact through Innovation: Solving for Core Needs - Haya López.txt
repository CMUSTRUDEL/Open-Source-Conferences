Abstract: Much of our work is a process of problem-solving. But for whom are these problems being solved? And are they the best problem to solve? In this session, we'll take a look at the different ways we can identify the core needs of whoever we're solving while ensuring we maintain a space for innovation and idea generation. We will explore a few different frameworks and mental models to ensure you leave this workshop with tools you can immediately leverage in your work.

welcome everyone i still see

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
a few folks trickling in

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
we'll go ahead and get started with some

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
introductions

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
i'm gonna give everyone a heads up that

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
this will be

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
a little bit interactive i'm using a

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,720
tool called miro which some of you may

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,920
be familiar with

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
and you'll get a chance to explore it in

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
a little bit

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,480
as we test out some of the frameworks

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
that i'll be sharing throughout this

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
presentation so don't worry i'll i'll

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
get you all prepped and warmed up and

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
then

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
we'll we'll dive in and experiment with

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,320
with the tool if you haven't

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
experimented with it but more

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
importantly with the frameworks

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,039
which i'm sure that you have maybe some

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,920
exposure to but maybe not

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
in this particular way so welcome

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,640
everyone

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
thank you so much for joining me again

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,320
it's so so nice to

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,680
see all of you and and see that our list

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
is growing here

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
um with all of the participants it's

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
been a great

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,119
two days i it home stretch of the last

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
90 minutes or two hours before the the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,080
closing

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
of all things open and it's just been

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,360
wonderful to see the diversity of the

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,119
speakers the keynotes have been

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
absolutely incredible

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
and just the adaptation to this format

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,040
virtually

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
has been wonderful to see so i hope all

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
of you have been enjoying yourself

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
you're still here you're you're

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,079
still engaged so that's a good sign for

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
me for sure

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
so if you're joining this uh

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,799
conversation we're going to be talking

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,119
about

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,560
just how the different ways that we

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
could be

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,240
identifying what the core problems are

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
that we want to solve what core needs

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
are

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000
that we want to solve for and how to

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
really have an impact

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,479
uh and continue to innovate through this

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
open source community or through the

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
variety of projects and problems that we

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,439
address in our day-to-day

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,399
so to introduce myself a little bit more

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,200
i'm uh my name is heya lopez i'm the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,600
director of product experience at optum

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
i'm specifically on the fusion optum

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,440
accelerator team which is

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,239
which is an internal uh innovation

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,640
and internal enterprise accelerator the

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,680
fusion team serves the whole enterprise

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120
we operate across optum

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
united health group and united

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
healthcare so all within the healthcare

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,840
space

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,080
which right now is filled with

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,080
problems and needs and challenges to be

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
addressed and so hopefully

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
you will embark on this journey with me

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
today to

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,840
start to carve out and break down some

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,400
of those needs and identify solutions

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,760
for them as we progress

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,720
and within my role

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
there's a lot of cross functionality so

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
before i i

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,840
progress there's a lot of elements to

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
what we do we interact with

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,560
technologists business strategists

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
within our team alone we have

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
people with product backgrounds business

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
backgrounds uh

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
user experience and design backgrounds

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
and so

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
just within our our team of 25 people we

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
have a mix and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
diverse perspectives and across the

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,319
different projects that

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,519
we interact with and that we serve

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
across the enterprise

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,879
we also interact across the different

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
disciplines

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,480
and within that what i'm hoping to share

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
with all of you

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
are some of the ways that we create

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
collaboration across those

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
ideas and not just in terms of there

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
have been a lot of great sessions today

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
talking about

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
how to collaborate across open source

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,599
platforms how to collaborate across

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
um just sharing of ideas

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
and so hopefully you'll weave all of

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,239
those learnings if you attended some of

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
those sessions

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
into the conversation that we have here

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,640
today that's one component of it

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
and really the other component which

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,239
we'll be focusing on

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
are the essential frameworks that you

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,319
can leverage

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,080
regardless of what position you are in

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,560
and that both is in terms of what

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
level you're at within an organization

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
uh within a startup or a larger

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
corporation

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
as well as frameworks that you can

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
leverage regardless of what position

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,759
you're in and what discipline you're in

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,079
and so there's so much that we can look

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
at

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,080
in terms of how to identify the core

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
needs of an individual or a population

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
that we're serving

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,880
personas probably come to mind uh for

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,600
for some folks if you've dabbled in that

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,600
and really it goes beyond that it's it's

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,160
much more far-reaching in the way that

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
we can identify corn needs but also

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
take that through to the end of that

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,320
story of defining

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,639
what the actual core problem we should

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,600
be addressing no matter how small or how

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
big in magnitude so the focus of our

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
conversation today

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
is threefold we're looking at the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,120
intersection once you have a person

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
that you've identified that you want to

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
solve for the persona

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
the population the um

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,199
internal department that you're working

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
within

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
we've done projects across issue

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
management internally within the company

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
of how

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,440
claims get processed and and what the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,759
the phone

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,199
uh call center triage process might be

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,800
so it could be as simple as

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,840
or complex as as that or it could be as

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,360
specific as

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,000
um you know a particular challenge you

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
and your co-worker are trying to address

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,880
so it could be as small as that or it

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,639
could be

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,759
as big as a whole uh process that you're

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
trying to address

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
so once you know who who it is that

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
you're

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,479
you're solving for that persona or that

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
person or that population

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
we look at their core needs and that's

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
through

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
leveraging clayton christensen jobs to

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,639
be done framework

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,080
and the the critical piece here is how

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,240
we apply it within

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
the context of our work that i think is

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
very applicable across industries and

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
across positions as i said

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
we'll get into these in specifics uh in

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
a moment

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
so once you've identified the persona's

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,800
needs in the context of i hire you to

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,759
which is the framing that we'll use

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
we can begin to look at how to translate

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
those

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
learnings around the jobs to be done

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
from our persona

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
into the value stories that we want to

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
begin to unwind

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,759
uh and unravel so as a and then this is

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,880
addressing the the persona or the

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,400
population

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,199
i want some goal so that this reason

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
so an example here you know as a patient

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
i need

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,919
uh guidance and ease of communication

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
with my care team

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,479
so that i can effectively manage my

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,520
ongoing health considerations

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,000
and so with both of those components you

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
can then start to unravel

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
what the intersections of people process

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
and technology the capabilities that you

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
want to use

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
to begin to solve those needs and you're

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
getting very specific

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
into what the core elements are that you

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
want to address

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
and what i've found in the work that

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
that

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
we do as we interact with folks at

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
different stages of the development

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
process different stages of their

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,400
strategy

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
alignment processes they may have one

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
component of this

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,240
but the the really nuanced piece is how

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,000
to combine these three

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,479
to really illustrate a a whole

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
story and not just to reuse the value

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,560
story term or the

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,800
uh user story term but just to to craft

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,080
that story so that someone understands

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,919
what the cape the reason behind

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
the capabilities that have been selected

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
or the the solutions that have been

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
selected

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
and as part of that empathy building

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,440
with the persona as part of that

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
uh evolving of who that person is and

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,639
what their core

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
why is what their core job is that they

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,919
need to be

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
addressed and the reasons behind it you

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,280
strip out a lot of different

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,680
assumptions that can be made around why

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,120
this end solution or this component of

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,479
the solution

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,000
is uh is essential or is

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,000
the right solution

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
so i'm going to get into an example and

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
then i'll pause for questions and then

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
we'll actually

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
try and do this with the group that we

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,919
have here which i have

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
complete and utter faith in all of you

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
given that your

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,039
minds have been exercised for the last

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,479
two days

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,599
so i built out an example persona uh

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,760
for us and i'll show you what

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
this uh the implementation of this

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
framework looks like in the context of

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
this persona and then i'll

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
introduce you to an entirely different

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,519
person and we can test it out

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,360
so maria here she's recently retired

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
she's widowed she has children and

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,080
grandchildren

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
and she is her health conditions in this

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
context is

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
she has diabetes recently diagnosed

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
actually

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
depression and some beginning

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
indications of

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,279
dementia she's pretty active in her

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,800
community she loves dancing

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,720
fitness and she really is self-taught in

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
a lot of ways she loves exploring new

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
hobbies

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,959
and so her background is that her

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,720
primary language is spanish

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,279
she usually tries to text photos where

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
she can to her care team so her doctor

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,600
and

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,800
maybe the nurse that she's in contact

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
with because she's not really

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
comfortable

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,480
speaking in english to describe the

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,839
medical issues specifically

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
it's hard for her to pronounce the

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,160
medications she takes and

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
it's just you know she speaks english

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
but it

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
not medical english necessarily and not

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
fluently

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,959
so these are some of the challenges that

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,120
she's experiencing her goals

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,880
are spending time with her family

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,800
managing her diet

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,279
some of her worries are that losing the

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,959
mental acuity her memories

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
and really becoming a burden on her

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,200
family she really just wants to

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,720
to take ownership and and she believes

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
that the tools that

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
she could have access to um the

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
technology she could have access to

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,959
would would really help her in that

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
um and she sees the potential in them

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,160
but right now it's just not serving

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,399
those needs for her so taking the

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
the framework and the structure and this

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
is

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,360
very simplified um we when

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
i normally do this work with my clients

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
and my

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,760
uh the participants and in my sessions

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
we

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
spend several hours building and

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,000
empathizing

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and go diving into the research to

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
really break down each of these

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
components

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,160
but i did all that work for you and so

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,040
i'm going to show you

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,120
the end output of what this looks like

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,320
so based on maria's needs

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
we identified one core job to be done

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
for her

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,279
she hires us to communicate

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
with her so i hire you to communicate

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,839
with me

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,519
and my loved ones in a way that is

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,079
meaningful and helps us

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
all understand so given the

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,959
prioritization of this

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
you know that's the there's so many

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,600
elements to this there's a spanish

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
speaking

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
component to the communication there's

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,640
involving her loved ones

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,680
as well there's wanting to to

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,079
address meaning and and help her

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,360
understand not just tell her what to do

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
so there's a lot of different

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,640
layers to this one need so in order to

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
further define the need we that's where

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,959
the value stories come in it helps us

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,360
expand and elaborate and add more detail

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,480
and it also allows us to to begin to

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
start thinking about

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
what the solutions are that we want to

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
use to address it those capabilities

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
and also think about what are the

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
components of measuring

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,360
the success so the the personas needs

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,639
the job to be done for her

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,480
helps us pave that way so for the value

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,880
stories to help build on that

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
as a patient who speaks spanish natively

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,279
so we're adding that level of detail

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
it's not just

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,600
about maria's this abstract person but

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,920
it's about as a

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
patient who speaks native and spanish

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,600
natively she wants

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,639
i want to have language options so that

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,920
i can understand

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,279
my health needs fully also as a patient

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
who lives by herself

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,519
i want to have someone to talk to so i

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
don't feel lonely

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,600
and as a patient with multiple care

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,000
providers i need one place to message

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
them

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
so i can reduce the chance of missing

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,959
something important

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
so in her case she has a lot of

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,680
different providers she has a lot of

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
different doctors that she's dealing

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,360
with so that's part of the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
element of complexity around the

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,519
communication needs for her

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
there's also this sort of subtle

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
component in that second bullet around

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
loneliness

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,959
so very simply the capabilities or

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
solutions that we start to build out and

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,000
remember this is multifaceted so that's

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,560
very very

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,120
uh simplified but this could be tools

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,399
the platforms features specific actions

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
any uh any sort of component to the

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
solution

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
it could be a variety of things but in

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,040
this case let's say

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
the capabilities or the solutions are a

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,560
chat bot function

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
language options for her to select

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
spanish

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,360
and personalized communication

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
preferences she wants to check that box

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
that she's

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
uh texting primarily because that gives

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,800
her a little bit of time to figure out

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,920
what she needs to say

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,440
and how she wants to relay her her

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,639
question so let me pause there because

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,839
we're going to get into

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
an example and actually have you dive

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,560
into this

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,480
i'll i'll pause for a second any

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,959
questions any

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
thoughts that you want to jump in here

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,959
before we dive into the

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
activity

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,839
pulling up the chat

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,519
so feel free to put any questions you

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
have in the zoom chat window the zoom q

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,680
a window

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:31,839
or you can raise your hand and we'll

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,839
recognize you

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
while you're thinking of those questions

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,199
if you do have them

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
i'm posting the link to this mirror that

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
i'm sharing

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,680
because we're going to dive into it

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,320
together i'll give everyone

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,399
uh another 30 seconds to think of a

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:13,839
question if you have it

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:13,839
and to get into that link

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,279
so the link should be in the chat oh i

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:41,839
sent it to just panelists one moment

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:41,839
thank you michael

wonderful all right so i see a couple

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,680
folks

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
diving in here a few more we'll give

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,160
everyone

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:11,759

have you anyone who has not

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
used demiro before it'll just help me

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,839

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,959
detail to go into here so ping me in the

leverage these frameworks and a really

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,800
awesome collaborative

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,640
virtual collaboration tool

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
same

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,640
thing for the moment so i'm going to

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
introduce you to a new persona

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,760
this is a little bit a different person

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,400
just to give us a

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,679
more to experiment with here this is

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,280
annie thank you

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,919
sorry to interrupt you if you're going

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,679
to have an interactive um

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
activity through chat people should make

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,400
sure they send their messages to

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,400
everyone

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,400
perfect yeah make sure you send to all

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,840
and not just two panelists

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,640
um yes that would be great

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,039
and we'll be adding uh components into

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,200
the mirror directly as well

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
um but either way i'll keep an eye on

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,760
the chat and

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,799
michael you'll help me out as well

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,240
all right so annie here is a

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,880
single mom with depression she

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
sort of had the life plan put together

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
has

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
two beautiful children but things didn't

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,480
quite work out

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
with her husband there was a lot of

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,960
bumps in the road and and they weren't

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
able to

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,919
to keep things uh moving forward so

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
she uh and he decided to get a divorce

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,000
and that's where things began to sort of

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
unravel for her she's not really sure

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,840
exactly

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,720
when the depression started but feels

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,799
that

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,000
at a minimum it's just totally out of

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,160
her control

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
and at a maximum she's just trying to

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,840
keep it together

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,320
make sure she has ends meet um and

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
really

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,000
is is eager to to keep her kids happy

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,919
um and keep as much control over her

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,440
depression as possible which is

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,880
very tricky um as it sort of spiraled

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
and escalated

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
so she's really hard working she's

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,919
normally

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,559
uh just very eager to stay healthy

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,480
and to go on runs and play with her kids

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,720
she's very active in their lives

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
attending their recitals and their games

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,600
and so really her main

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
sort of health concern here

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
is her her mental health and keeping

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,520
things stable

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,120
and making sure her kids are happy and

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,679
stable

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
so if this is our persona and this is

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,400
sort of the

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
the high level of detail that we're

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,240
working within she's you know director

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,360
marketing at a real estate company

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
um nurturing mom

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,039
so now we're gonna test out those jobs

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
to be done and look at the progression

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,720
between jobs to be done

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,520
into the the value stories so

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,799
pretty simple if you haven't used this

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
before

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
all you need to do is double click into

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,200
the sticky note

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,880
so you'll see i am typing right here

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,320
i've laid out a bunch of sticky notes

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
over here for you so you just need to

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,440
double click

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,360
onto it over here if you're still

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,320
looking at my shared screen

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,919
over here if you click on this tab it'll

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
give you the navigation

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,200
cursor but you can also click the arrow

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
that will give you the opportunity to

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,640
actually type into the sticky note

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
so that's the the mechanical piece and

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,919
you can move around like this

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
i'm going to bring everyone to me one

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,720
more time just so i

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,760
make sure everyone is where they need to

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,919
be and if you

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,440
need to move over to the left to where

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,760
the persona is you can

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,760
sort of drag the cursor over to the left

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,360
so now i want you to think about annie

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,000
what are her goals

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,960
from personal physical emotional or work

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,840
related

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,480
so it's all through her perspective so i

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
annie

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,039
hire you too and use all of us so all

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,880
all of our diverse skill sets of the

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,960
folks in the room if we had an

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
a 90-minute session here together i

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
would have everyone introduce themselves

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,039
and get a sense of who's in the room

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
but just think through who you are and

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,919
what what you're

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,440
able to offer someone like annie don't

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
think about solutions just yet

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
but think about you know her personal

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,120
physical emotional and work related

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
needs so an example that i have here i

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
hire you to

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
help me without me needing to seek it

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,120
out she's overwhelmed she has a lot on

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
her plate with her kids

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
and she just she just needs the help

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,799
when she needs it

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
or i hire you to make my life easier

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,640
just simple

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,400
broad so i'd love to have the the

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
couple of folks that are in here with me

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
just dive right in add in a couple

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,039
sticky notes and then we'll

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:45,840
progress it um just to to keep the

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,840
keep the conversation moving

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,080
so i see a question here along top or

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
side i would just add it down here in

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,159
these sticky notes that

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,480
i have already built out if you need

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,600
more feel free to add another one

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,960
another row if you need it

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,520
but great you all are as smart and savvy

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
as i

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,720
thought you would be so you're diving in

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,960
i'll give you another 30 seconds

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,960
to a minute to fill out some more of

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
these

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
okay

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,760
these are great

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,200
be a workout buddy help me find new ways

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,039
of dealing with my condition

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:37,039
take my mind off what's already weighing

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:38,559
me down

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,559
help me when i'm feeling low these are

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,480
wonderful carpool yes

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,480
just very practical

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,840
awesome so finish up your last sticky

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
here and we'll keep it moving

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,559
these are awesome help my my mental

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,720
health without focusing

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,240
on my mental health make me feel good

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,919
about myself

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,360
take care of my yard work some of these

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,600
are very specific

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,720
to the point which is really good and

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
some of these are a little bit more

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,039
broad-based

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,120
um which is also really good so normally

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
what we do at this stage is we

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,799
theme all of these into buckets just to

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,440
get a better sense of

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,760
not only quantity it's aware where the

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,400
weight is heavier in one area versus

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,640
another

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,720
which helps allows us to shape our focus

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
and then theming also just helps create

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
a little bit of structure

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
around the content especially normally

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,120
in these sessions we have 20 or so fee

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,360
people all adding content at the same

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,960
time and so we'll we'll be able to to

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,240
get a better sense of the content that's

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
there and give each

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,120
section it's its time and its discussion

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
point

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,520
so as you're finishing up your next your

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
last sticky here i'll move over to the

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
value stories and then i'll show you how

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,200
they

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,799
connect so what i'd love for you to do

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:13,679
is we can choose one of these

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:18,240
and i'll say let me take a peek here

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,240
choose a couple that relate so

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,559
connect

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
focus

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,200
you

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
all right so i'm going to take these

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
handful which

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
all of these obviously overlap because

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,360
we're talking about the same

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,039
persona so in a sense they all relate

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,360
because of that

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,679
but in an effort to continue to move us

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,960
along we would you know normally

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,720
theme we would vote even or

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
just sort of have a decision maker in

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,200
the room decide that this is the the

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,039
highest priority item

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
for now i'm just sort of deciding that

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,279
these are the four highest priority

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
pieces help me with my mental health

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,840
without focusing on my mental health

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,000
help

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,760
balance work and personal life connect

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,720
to me with other individuals who have

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,640
similar goals

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,320
and help me organize my life so i'm not

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,240
as stressed

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,960
on what i might have forgotten to do

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,559
so now we're gonna think through what

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,400
the value stories are

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,400
against these jobs that annie is hiring

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,679
us to do so we're looking at

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,559
the user which is uh

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
annie in this case and the ultimate

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,799
objective

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,679
of of her goal so she wants to do

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,240
something for

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,320
for the motivator uh what what motivates

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
them what drives them so we're sort of

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,400
stripping away assumptions here and

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,159
really trying to concretely say what she

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
needs and why

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,080
and their purpose or their core need so

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,720
this is uh where

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,240
the the job to be done could come in as

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
well

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,760
so take a stab at it you might see here

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,080
so as a patient i want to have access to

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,159
my last visit detailed notes so this is

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,520
unrelated to annie but just sort of

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,279
shows you the structure

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
as a patient i want to have access to my

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,440
last visit detailed notes

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,159
so that i can review my care plan before

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,679
my next appointment

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,440
i would love for you to just take a

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,799
couple minutes here to dive in

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,440
i see there's something in the chat

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
yes dot voting is a feature of miro

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,640
minimal simple yeah that's

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
we definitely use the dot voting

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,799
sometimes we use the emojis

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,840
um on the sticky note itself definitely

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,520
gets the job done that's a great

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,120
addition

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,279
awesome so i would love to have you jump

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,080
in here and this is where you would

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,000
weave in one of these four so choose one

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,840
you can choose a second one later but

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,679
really focus in on one

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,520
and what the goal is that they're trying

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,600
to identify and for what reason so

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,000
you're extrapolating you're adding more

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,120
levels of detail here

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,080
and i can show you

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,799
jump back to sort of the specific

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,880
example of the progression so we took

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,960
i hire you to communicate with me and my

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
loved ones in a way that is meaningful

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
and helps us understand

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,600
we took that core job to be done and we

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,559
built out these three value stories

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,880
against it so remember how we defined

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,080
communicate in a variety of ways from

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,399
the language

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,679
component of maria speaking spanish but

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,600
also from a

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,679
multiple care providers component

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,279
because she has a lot of conditions

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
so how would that be similar or

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,480
different here

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
as we dive in

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,200
so user yeah great question michael so

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,320
the user type here would just be

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,039
annie so in our case we only have one

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
uh persona just for the sake of time so

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,440
our persona annie

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
you can abstract it out to patients in

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,120
general

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,600
so patients with depression you can add

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,080
a level of detail around annie so in a

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,440
similar

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,679
way to maria we said as a patient

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
with a language barrier i forget the

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,000
exact phrasing but as a

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,919
patient who speaks spanish natively and

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,120
then that was sort of the descriptor

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,640
around the persona

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,320
so for annie it might be

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,159
as a nurturing mom uh

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,679
i want let's see

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,880
i want help

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,480
balancing work and personal life

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,480
so that i can

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:57,200
get to my therapy appointments

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,840
so that i can prioritize running

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
every day

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,120
and i would love feedback or input on it

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,520
if user type is confusing if there are

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,559
other

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:20,559
terms that would be more

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,559
clear open to suggestions

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
there

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,919
and if you're confused i just say these

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,480
are great

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,480
keep it simple i like it if you're

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,880
confused or have any questions well

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:19,840
folks are filling in

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:19,840
just let me know and i will answer them

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,760
so just to explain this a little bit

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,360
more as folks are

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,559
diving in here the the reason there's a

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,200
progression from

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,200
jobs to be done to value stories to

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,840
capabilities which is essentially the

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,200
variety of solutions that we build out

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,279
is we're crafting this holistic view

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,640
and the way that we use this is if we're

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,480
diving in with a particular project

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,080
no matter what stage it's at but let's

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,600
say they've defined their persona

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,120
they've defined the market that they're

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,840
trying to serve

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,880
they have maybe an existing solution but

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,360
it's not

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,200
where it needs to be from from a

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,880
technology and development perspective

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,080
so they're looking to evolve it and

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,559
upgrade it

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,000
and so if that's the case then we don't

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,279
want to necessarily

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,600
just throw out solutions and up

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,080
create updates that may not necessarily

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,039
solve whatever the challenges are that

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,320
annie or or maria are experiencing we

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,039
might instead

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,880
want to shape this holistic story of who

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,360
that market is

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
what their current challenges are with

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,600
the tool or with the

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
the their health care needs in this case

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,799
um within the industry that we're

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,039
operating in

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,360
and then be able to shape that all in

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,519
one single page so that that example

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,080
that i showed earlier on that one

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,200
single page so someone can view that and

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,399
better understand

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,840
okay this is why i'm creating a chat bot

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,799
it's not just so that it's an

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,440
easily accessible thing the chat bot is

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,519
so that

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,440
our patient can talk to their 10

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,799
providers that they have because of all

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,799
of their chronic conditions

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,919
and so i've chosen these

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
four jobs to be done in theory it would

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,679
be one but

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,119
you know we would build out all four

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,040
separately we could even have

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
them you know listed out in their own

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
columns

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,839
and then build out underneath them would

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,839
be another way to organize it

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,919
these don't relate yeah so exactly so

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
michael pointed out so this is great

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,960
this is why we we

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,560
test it out and actually experiment with

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
the framework to better understand how

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,960
it's used and how it's leveraged

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,960
there isn't necessarily a wrong way to

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,919
to approach any of this all of these

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,960
details are

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,399
are important and helpful um

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
assuming obviously that we're all

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,000
familiar with with annie as a persona

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,240
we've read through the user

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,280
research we understand you know what the

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,960
current state is

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,800
for her which we're acting under that

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,440
assumption here today

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
but then we build out you know from

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,480
there

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,560
what what each of these jobs to be done

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,560
components are what the value stories

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,320
from there are and then ultimately what

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,040
solutions and capabilities we want to

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,040
drive towards

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,880
great awesome so this is

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
this great content i'm going to continue

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,640
along

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,000
to show you where we end up here um now

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,040
that folks are

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,520
a little bit more on the the

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,880
same page of how this all progresses

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,400
and the last piece here in the process

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,200
as i zoom in here it sort of

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,520
ends the section of of y'all's

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,280
interactive component although i'll wrap

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,520
up in a second here and then we can

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,599
dive into this tool as much or as little

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,440
as everyone wants to in the last

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,440
10 minutes or so here so

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,560
once you have all the jobs to be done

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,960
once you have

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,640
all the user stories or value stories

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,160
value stories are a little bit different

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,760
in this context they're structured

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,240
similarly but it helps

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,400
build out the sort of holistic story

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,920
that we're building out

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,480
and in this context the the

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,240
the whole view that one slide that i

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,359
showed earlier with each of the three

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
components

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,760
allows us to shape a better picture of

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,200
what measurement we want to have what

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,760
uh opportunities we have to

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,720
identify key performance indicators to

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,000
really shape up

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,599
you know how these solutions are

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,680
matching up to what the needs are so

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,760
we're not just making assumptions

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,960
and building things and then seeing if

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,400
they they

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,440
are successful or not so in this context

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
in this last

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,800
step here as we're running through uh

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,640
with

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,320
you know a group of people maybe it's

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,000
all your your

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,359
your specific team or maybe you're

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,440
bringing in diverse

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,119
sets of expertise into the conversation

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,520
whatever the case may be is you want

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,640
some level of prioritization

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,000
so you want to reflect on the

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,520
core needs of the value stories as well

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,119
as the um the capabilities that you've

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,320
identified so assume that we went

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,680
through that

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
and you want to map out where they fall

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,079
within

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,920
a two by two would be one way to

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,320
prioritize it there's so many different

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,119
ways this is just one way that we're

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,680
we're sharing here and even within a two

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
by two prioritization matrix you might

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,359
even decide that the two by two

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,760
components are different

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,359
so what we have here is high impact and

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,480
low impact

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,000
high impact being to the persona so to

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,640
annie specifically

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
you know what would benefit her the most

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,359
and

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,720
by identifying what her core needs are

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,280
and the value that

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,480
uh the value story that she has shaping

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,800
her whole picture

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,480
of who she is and her needs we're able

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
to determine a little bit better

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,079
what is highest impact versus lowest

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,599
impact is it

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,440
the uh hiring a personal chef to help

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,400
her with her cooking needs it might be

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,320
that might be her

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,560
you know one of if we removed that

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,720
because she absolutely hates shopping

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,920
um then her mental health and well-being

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,920
will increase

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
um so that's just with additional

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
research

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,839
high effort versus low effort this is in

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,160
terms of resources

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,200
you can think about in terms of time

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,920
number of people

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,920
you know the the financial impact you

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,640
could also switch these up so it could

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
be

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,920
instead of low effort high effort it

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,160
could be value to the business so if

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,800
you're trying to figure out which

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,079
areas align best to what your company

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
does what your team

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,520
excels at you could sort of do an

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,240
assessment based on that

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,800
first as well as tracking against the

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,960
impact

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
to the persona really depends on what

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,160
stage you're at and what you're trying

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,520
to quantify and this is just one way to

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,560
to break it down

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,200
and as you can see within this structure

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,240
we have

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,119
a couple of buckets that allow you to

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,440
identify which

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,040
are the quick wins so things that you

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,079
are low effort but high impact that you

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,520
can just crank out

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,560
to create a better experience for annie

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
and then the big bets the areas uh that

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,000
will

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,280
have the potentially a high risk

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,720
associated to them but

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,400
because of the research that you've done

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,480
in the discussions that you've had

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,480
the high effort and high impact really

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,119
indicate that this is going to be worth

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,520
the investment and then there's you know

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,000
so

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
sort of the other fill-ins potentially

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,320
or you know

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,480
backlog that maybe should just

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,440
get trashed because they're low impact

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,000
and high effort

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,839
but maybe some of those we can we

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,079
wheedle out some ones that

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,520
would be beneficial and could be a

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,520
better fill-in

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:50,640
later on or to add additional features

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,960
so with that i'm happy to jump around i

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,920
think we have about five minutes left

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,560
here

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,320
this is my contact email if you have

00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,359
specific questions you've tested out the

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,119
framework and

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,280
you're lost or you've tested out the

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,359
framework and you've improved upon it

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
would love to to hear from all of you on

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,760
on what that looks like

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
for each of you and share learnings

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,880
across the board because that would be

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,800
really wonderful to see how you've

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,560
experimented with it i imagine it won't

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
be in the context of health care

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,480
um although hopefully these examples

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
these real life examples

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
uh will were able to get you a better

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,200
idea

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,240
of how this all flows together so with

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,319
that yes i am

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,160
sorry to interrupt we do have about five

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,800
minutes left in the session um as you

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,480
know

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,359
so feel free to use that time to

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,880
entertain questions or for any other

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,319
discussion or comments you might have

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,319
awesome thanks michael

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,839
so i'm keeping an eye on the chat here

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,720
also the q a but feel free to just jump

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,680
in

00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,760
i'll zoom out to this whole awesome

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,920
i love it when folks make mural their

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,319
own there's so many tools like this and

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
there

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,240
there's a free version of this for you

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,680
to play around with as well

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,800
tons of functionality wireframing

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,800
whole slew of things

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,960
any questions from folks thoughts

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,960
comments

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,119
have you used jobs to be done before

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,640
have you used value stories or

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:35,839
or prioritization in this way personas

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,839
in this way

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,800
we do have a question from michael so

00:41:51,119 --> 00:42:03,040
let me give him a talking permission

00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:06,319
and uh this question can be asked

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,319
and michael is muted

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,280
okay ted can you hear me now yes yes

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,880
thank you

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,599
this is great to be unmuted i've been

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,599
typing all day

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,920
um i've just recently heard about jobs

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,400
to be done so that's interesting

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,400
thanks for

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,599
reintroducing it to me and absolutely

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,560
so it's good to see some old tools with

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,319
some new tools

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,920
because i kind of knew the personas so

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,400
it's neat to see how you're playing with

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,319
that with mural

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,000
awesome yeah it's it's interesting to

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,240
play around with these frameworks in

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,480
combination with one another because it

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,839
often gleans either a different story or

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,720
a new insight

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,640
or at a minimum would just reinforces

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:08,400
what we already know which is

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:08,400
