Abstract: An impactful career, one where we lead, motivate, and push the state of the art forward is more than just a series of jobs. It is a narrative that includes our jobs, of course, and many other things as well such as outside projects, schooling, and volunteer work. And it's those things, not the jobs, so much, that often give us the greatest power to shift our career narrative in the direction we want.

uh welcome everybody

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
uh good morning good afternoon uh or

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
good evening welcome from whatever time

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,240
zone you

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,960
are in the world i am in pacific time

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,520
so it's 7 30 in the morning here so it's

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
a little

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,880
early for me but i've had some coffee i

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
have more coffee

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039
right here just in case i'm actually

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,960
thrilled to be able to do

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,320
this talk for you even if it is quite

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
early here

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
i'm sarah may and i am a software

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,200
architect of salesforce

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,559
and i'm here to talk to you today about

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
making a career out of your jobs

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,760
and so before we begin i want to give

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,640
you

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
three caveats and the first is that this

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
talk is

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,079
not about what i do a tales force

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
like at all this talk is about crafting

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
your career and thinking outside of the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
box of any one particular job

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
as a result i'm not going to tell you

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
very much about what i actually do at

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,359
salesforce other than to say

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
like the slide says that i'm a software

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
architect so i write code i think about

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
systems

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
and right now i'm writing code and

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
thinking about systems in the context of

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
design systems we have our open source

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,400
lightning design system

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
so if you're interested in design

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,080
systems with salesforce hit me up later

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
because this talk doesn't have any of

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
that so that's the first caveat

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
uh the second one is as michael

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,680
mentioned this talk is not

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,560
45 minutes long i think we're scheduled

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,560
here until 11 15 eastern 8 15 pacific

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
and i expect us to have plenty of time

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
for q a

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
within that block um and if nobody has

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
questions you can have some time back at

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
the end

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,799
however if you have a question that you

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
don't want to ask publicly

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
or that you think of later here's my

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
contact info this is my email and my

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
twitter

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
feel free to send me an email or a dm at

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
any time

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
and i'll put this slide back up at the

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
end when we take questions

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,719
and the third caveat is so important

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,759
that i made it into its own slide

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,200
and that is that we are living in weird

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,039
times right now things are hard

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
this is actually the second time that

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,640
i've done this talk and the first time

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,680
was at the end of march

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
of this year and at that point we had

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
all

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
just started working from home and it

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,400
felt like we were in the middle of three

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,800
simultaneous worldwide crises a health

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
crisis with covet 19 of course a racial

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,239
justice crisis here in the united states

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
at a global leadership crisis centering

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,120
around climate change and here we are

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
six months later

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,680
and we are still in the middle of a

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,080
worldwide health crisis and we are still

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,959
in the middle of a racial justice crisis

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
and we are still

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,720
in the middle of a global leadership

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
crisis and most people in the tech

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
industry are still

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
working from home haven't seen their

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,599
company desk in six months

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,959
most schools are still closed my two

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,560
kids are doing

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
virtual learning from home asking me how

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
that's going

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
and in the u.s more than six million

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
people have lost their jobs in the last

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,080
six months

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
and so with everything that's going on i

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
think it's fair to ask

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,560
should we even be talking about our

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,599
career does this even appropriate

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,040
there's so much that's going on beyond

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,840
our own stories

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959
and that's a fair question but all this

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
upheaval is i think

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
all the more reason to talk about ways

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
to shift the narrative

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
in our career i've lived through a

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,799
number of these

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,400
cataclysms in my career since i started

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
working in the mid 90s the popping of

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
the first internet bubble

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,799
911 the economic collapse of 2008

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
and situations like this events like

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
this

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,720
um always make a lot of people step back

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
and ask am i doing the right thing

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
is my effort going towards something

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,599
that's important

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
am i going in the right direction and if

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,280
not

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,080
how do i change that and this is a talk

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
about

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
changing your career narrative with open

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
source so

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
excuse me i think the talk is actually

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,640
quite timely

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,640
because lots of us are looking for ways

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,200
to make meaningful contributions to

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,720
society with our work

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
and fundamentally that's what this is

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,400
about

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,160
so with those three caveats out of the

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,160
way let's start with two words

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
jobs and career we often tend to think

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
of them together

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,440
right what is my career you might ask

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
but the list of the jobs that i've had

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,040
but it can be very useful for us to

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
consider these two concepts separately

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
so let's start with

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,000
jobs everyone has a list of jobs usually

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
on linkedin

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
or in a pdf resume in a long forgotten

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
folder on your laptop

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,199
or on a personal website somewhere that

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,560
hasn't been updated in three years um

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,160
specifically for this talk though when i

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
think the word jobs i need something a

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
little bit different from the stuff you

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
list on linkedin

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
because what you list there tends to be

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
like companies or organizations that

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
you've worked for

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,280
but you may have had one or more than

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,440
one job within each

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
company a word that's maybe a little

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,039
closer to what i'm talking about is

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
roles i think of each new situation you

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,520
go into where you're learning new things

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
and making

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
different use of your past experience as

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,199
a new job whether or not it's at the

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
same company

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
or at a different company or some

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,160
combination they're all jobs that you

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,080
have over the course of your career

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
now fundamentally your list of jobs is

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
what shows up on linkedin

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
as we mentioned or a resume right it's

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,840
public it's outwardly facing it gives

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
people an

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,560
idea of what you've done your career on

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
the other hand is an

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
is a concept it's a narrative it's it's

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,440
an

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
inwardly facing idea it's for you

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,080
to help you make sense of what you're

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,000
doing and where you're going

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600
your jobs are a part of your career

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
narrative of course but there's a lot

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
more to it

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,360
than that i think of a career as a story

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
arc

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
as a narrative you'll hear me say that a

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
lot it describes what you're here to do

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
i don't mean here like at the conference

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
or here in your present role or here at

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
your present company but

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,280
here in the world to do

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
and your jobs are points along that arc

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
but they aren't the whole thing right

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,600
your career includes

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
schooling and training it includes

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
childhood events that led you down a

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
particular career path

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
maybe interactions with an influential

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
mentor

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
or a teacher you're really connected

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
with and then of course crucially for

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
this talk it also includes volunteer

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
work and side projects and

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,880
other activities that you do aside from

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,520
your job and it all makes up this

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,479
story and this story of course isn't

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
something that just

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,120
happens to you you're writing it

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
you can influence it you can bend it

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,880
towards what you want and each of these

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
elements are knobs you can turn or

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,400
leverage you could push

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,080
to change the direction of the narrative

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
now it's true that jobs are the big

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,199
spots on this arc so you might ask why

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,280
do we bother to talk about all this

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
little stuff side projects open source

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,199
blah blah blah when just getting the

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
right job has the biggest influence

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
on the direction of my career shouldn't

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
we focus on that

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
and we could if we lived in an ideal

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
world where having a job

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
wasn't tied to basic survival right in

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
an ideal world

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,039
we would never have to unexpectedly look

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
for a new job

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,800
and in an ideal world when we started

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,120
feeling like we wanted something new to

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
do

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,400
we'd have all the space and time and

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
energy

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,639
and resources to really look for and

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,800
wait for

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,759
the right job that moves us directly

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
forward in our goals

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,880
but most of us don't live in this ideal

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
world

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,800
most of us sadly have to participate in

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
capitalism to survive and in our world

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,599
being out of work is a fraught

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,560
scary situation it's connected to money

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
survival

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,000
and in the united states to health

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
insurance

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
we all have different situations and

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
sometimes we don't have the liberty to

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
wait for the perfect job that gives us

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000
all that survival stuff

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,800
and moves us along in our career

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
narrative sometimes we just need

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
a job and sometimes the best job is just

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,240
the one that's available

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
whether or not it feels like it's moving

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
us forward in the story and i just want

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
to

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,400
acknowledge that that we don't always

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,360
have the privilege to wait for exactly

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
the job

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
we want

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,960
but it doesn't mean that your career arc

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
is not in your control

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
because you have these other levers

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,319
besides jobs to

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,479
move the narrative of your career in the

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
direction that you want right remember

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,560
side projects and volunteer work

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
these we can wait for we can try

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
different ones to see which one feels

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
most like it's moving us in the right

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,599
career direction

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,959
and those small changes and the little

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
things that we learn

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,800
make us ready for the next job or role

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
transition right it gives us the higher

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,920
likelihood

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
that when we need to we'll be able to

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
efficiently find a job that offers both

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,560
survival

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,519
and career growth now side projects and

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
volunteer work

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
may feel like small levers in comparison

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
to your job after all you spend eight

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
hours a day at your job

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
how much realistically can you really

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
put into a side project in volunteer

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,440
work right an hour a week

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
or two at best

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,680
but these small levers can really have

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
an

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
outsized effect on your career even if

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,600
they seem small

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
compared to your jobs now i want to give

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
you an example from my own career to

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
make this more concrete

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
because there are many people out there

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
who will tell you do side projects it's

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
good for your career

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
participate in open source it's good for

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
your career

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,080
and when i hear that i often think about

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
an episode from the tv show south park

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
from long long long ago

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
i don't know if we have any south park

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,240
fans in the room uh but they had a bit

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
that they called the underpants gnomes

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
and the underpants gnomes had a business

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
plan and here's how the business plan

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,160
meant

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
uh they made a deck as you do when you

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
have a business plan

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
so here's the slide phase one collect

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,640
underpants phase two

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
question mark phase three profits and i

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
feel like telling people to work

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
on open source because it's good for

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
their career it's kind of like this

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,600
right it's like

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,839
phase one work on open source phase two

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
question mark phrase three it's good for

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
your career

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
uh but they often kind of leave out the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,320
how part right the phase two it's all

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
kind of vague

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,839
and let's assume that you're not gonna

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
be the one tenth of one percent of

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,399
developers

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,560
who are paid to work on open source so

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,000
how exactly does open source help

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,320
you and so that's what i'm going to talk

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,800
about today i'm going to talk about

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
an incident in my career even though

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
i've never been paid to work on open

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
source and that's not really a direction

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,040
that i'm interested in going

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,720
um you working in open source actually

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
did have a huge effect on my career

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,399
despite the fact that uh that's not

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,320
actually what i do for my day job

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
uh specifically because this is open

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
source of course instead of volunteer

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
work in general i'm going to talk about

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,519
how open source did this for me and the

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
project that i'm going to talk about is

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,760
called

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,600
diaspora and in order to understand how

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,440
this happens

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,800
we need to cast your mind

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,519
back to 2010 which is

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,839
literally a decade ago at this point

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,079
it's 2010 we're two years into obama's

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,079
presidency

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,640
and it's only been three years since the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,920
first iphone was released

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,680
um in 2010 four computer science

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,839
students from new york university

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
go to a lecture by a man named evan

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,959
moglin who is a well-known lawyer who

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
specializes in free and open source

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
software issues

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
and in this lecture a decade ago moglin

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,680
advocated

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
for alternatives to centralized

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
corporate-controlled social media like

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,399
facebook

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,079
and twitter he wanted the people who use

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
these platforms

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,959
rather than a corporation to have

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,880
control over their data what a concept

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,240
and he asked the audience to start

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,720
building these things and so these four

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,519
students went back to their dorm

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
and started thinking hmm maybe we should

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
do that

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
it was approaching the end of the spring

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,880
semester summer was coming none of them

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,200
had gotten internships yet so

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
they decided to do a kickstarter and ask

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,920
for money

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,440
to work for three months on creating a

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
federated social network that would give

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
people control

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
over their own information and that

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,639
project was what came to be known as

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,839
diaspora now i need to talk a little bit

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
about the structure of the system in

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
order to understand this so a federated

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
or distributed system is kind of like

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
this

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
right as opposed to facebook where which

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
would be one giant pile of cubes in the

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
middle

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
right each of these nodes are a separate

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
web application

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
with its own data store its own code

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
base and its own residence

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
and residents can be friends with other

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
residents that are in their node but

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
they can also be friends with residents

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
of other nodes while

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
retaining control over their data

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
because it's local and so the lines

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,399
between these nodes are the federation

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
part the sending of messages between

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
nodes when for example

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
you post a picture of your cat it gets

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
federated or copied out to all of the

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
nodes where you have friends so that

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,320
they can see it

00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
sounds like an easy problem the four

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
undergraduates can knock out in the

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,480
summer right

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,320
i guess you gotta start somewhere so

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,399
they posted a kickstarter and they asked

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
for ten thousand dollars to pay rent

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,720
eat ramen and write software for the

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
summer

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
but they got two hundred thousand

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
dollars instead of the ten thousand

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
dollars they asked for

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,000
now this seems a bit like old news at

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,639
this point but a decade ago in 2010

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,160
kickstarter was a very new thing i think

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,519
they actually knew one of the founders

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,920
and that's why they used it

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,440
and this was the first project ever on

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
kickstarter to be so

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
over funded and so they received an

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
enormous amount of attention just for

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
that

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,720
but they also hit the timing exactly

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,519
right on the topic because facebook was

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,519
being

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,800
more terrible than usual when they did

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,279
this

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
and people really wanted this to exist

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,480
and so because

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
of the topic area and because of the

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,800
drastic overfunding situation it

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
generated an enormous amount of media

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
attention

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
suddenly they were in the new york times

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,160
they found themselves minor celebrities

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,079
being recognized on the streets of new

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,920
york you can believe that

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,320
so they knew they had to get out of new

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,760
york to get any work done

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
one of the guys had an older brother who

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,279
worked at a small consulting company in

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,760
san francisco called pivotal labs which

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,920
at that point was about 40 people

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,040
working in a big open office space and

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,760
through that contact

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,760
pivotal offered the diaspora guys free

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,240
desk space

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
so they escaped from new york and they

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,240
came to san francisco

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
where they were incubated i guess you

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
could call it which pretty much meant

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
that they hung out

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
mostly kept to themselves and ate our

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,399
food in quantities that only starving

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,839
college students can achieve

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,160
because if you as you may have already

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
guessed pivotal labs was where i was

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,959
working at the time and this is where i

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
met them and first got interested in

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
working on their project

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
as i mentioned they kind of kept

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,120
themselves so i didn't get involved in

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,120
the project right away

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
i got involved at the end of the summer

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,360
so maybe three months into this project

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
they released what they had so far to

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
github which prompted another wave of

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,120
media scrutiny

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,120
uh scrutiny um you should have seen the

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
comment threads on equities and reddit

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,920
it was just comments for days um

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
and the day they released it i was on my

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,880
way to a conference so i cloned the

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
repository in the airport i started

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,680
looking at it and before i got on the

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
plane i tweeted about how it really

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,880
didn't have very many tests

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
and i should say at this point that a

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
decade ago

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
twitter was really still mostly software

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,839
people and most the folks who followed

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,079
me were other software engineers like

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,560
mostly people i actually knew

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
and so i didn't figure that it would be

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,800
noticed

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,279
much among the rest of the media circus

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,040
um but when i got off the plane and i

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
turned my phone back on

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,720
i had an email from github notifying me

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
that i'd been given commit access to the

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
repository with the note

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,519
yes we know we don't have that many

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,680
tests could you please fix it

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
and diaspora was a ruby on rails app

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,480
which is the sort of code i worked on

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,320
for pivotal labs

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
for physical clients right and i knew a

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
lot about testing for someone who's not

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
in the qa space so i saw an opportunity

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,920
to contribute something that i knew a

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,759
lot about to this project

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,959
i saw a gap that they needed someone to

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,480
fill

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
because they don't teach testing in cs

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
programs these days i guess

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,639
and my knowledge and experience was a

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
good fit and of course

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
over the years as i got more involved in

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
the project eventually ending up on the

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
core team

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
i did a lot of other things as well for

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,920
example i moved them off of mongodb to

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,519
my sql

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,079
which was also something i had done for

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,240
several pivotal clients

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
so the project felt like it was moving

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,120
me in the right direction though because

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
there was one aspect to it that i was

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,560
completely

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,560
unfamiliar with and that was the

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,399
federation or the distributed system

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
nature of diaspora

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
pivotal's clients wanted web

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
applications

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
so the projects i worked on for my day

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
job were typically

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,399
single web applications of course

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,480
connected to services and apis and so on

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,800
but just single nodes

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
diaspora's codebase therefore included

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
all the typical web application code

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,559
that i was very familiar with

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
but it also had code that i wasn't

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,000
familiar with that dealt specifically

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,120
with federating information across the

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,120
network

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,720
and as a result i helped build a

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,319
distributed system including defining

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,079
the protocols figuring out how to deal

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,079
with errors

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,439
and encountering problems like deleting

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,600
a post

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
that were trivial in a single web app

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,400
but in a distributed system where the

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,520
post had been federated to other nodes

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,160
was a deep

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,600
complex and very interesting problem

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,039
and the project felt right to me it felt

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,919
like it moved me in the right direction

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,600
because

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,480
it was something that i knew about i

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,840
could contribute namely the testing

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,120
but it was also something new for me

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,440
working on diaspora in my free time

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,280
added a depth to my experience that

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
really let me push my career to the next

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
level

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,400
to start dealing with systems of

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
software and code bases

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
rather than just with a single project

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
at a time

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
i doubt i could have gotten a job at

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,320
salesforce to be honest without that

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
experience

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
because while they certainly call here

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
to work on single web applications our

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
big

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
needy software problems involve

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
heterogeneous distributed systems

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,520
that have been under construction for

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
the better part of 20 years

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,400
diaspora gave me the lift i needed to

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,360
get into systems

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
i i have discovered that i'm a good

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
systems thinker but i didn't really

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
realize it until i started working on

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
this side project

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
i didn't think oh i want to get into

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
distributed systems so i should work on

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
diaspora i worked on it because i like

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
the people

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
because there was something i could

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,640
contribute and because i figured i'd

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
learn something i'd never been on the

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,200
core team of a major open source project

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,440
before and let me tell you

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
it was eye-opening in more ways than one

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
which brings me to my last point which

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
is that your career is a narrative but

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
you don't

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,120
need to know how it ends

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,720
getting involved in diaspora opened up

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
many new possibilities for me but the

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
one i capitalized the most on was

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
distributed systems because again it

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,880
felt right

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
your career is a story and you can write

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
it as you go

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,799
now some people are planners and god

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,039
bless them because i am not

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
i've always wanted to be but i'm not

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
these are the folks who

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,679
you know when they get that first job in

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,600
tech they have a plan right

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
first i'm going to work for this company

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
then i'm going to go to a startup

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
then i'm going to get this promotion

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
then i'm going to go to this other

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
company then i'm going to found a

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,840
company

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,760
right they've got this whole narrative

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
planned out all the way to

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
i guess retired to your private island

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,000
or something

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
and if you've got an end state in mind

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,120
like that

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,720
that's great right the nice thing about

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
it is it gives you very concrete and

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
tangible

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
questions to ask when you're trying to

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,480
decide whether to take a job or whether

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,640
to get involved in a project

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,400
does it move me towards my goal all

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
right we'll do it

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
does it not move me towards my goal i'll

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
pass now i've never been one of those

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
people

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,600
and so i do a lot more by feel right

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
does this job

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,559
feel like it's moving me in the right

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
direction does this project feel like a

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,159
good place for me

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,520
does it feel like i can learn something

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,640
from these people that's a big one for

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,159
me

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,159
you can make deliberate choices about

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,400
projects based on which one feels closer

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,120
trust your gut trust that you're moving

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,799
ever closer to what you want

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,799
even if you don't know what that is

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,720
so in summary i want you to use your

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,080
side projects as volunteer work to shift

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,280
your career narrative and i have a

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,360
little bit of advice here

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,159
commit to a project slowly

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,320
there are a lot of good blog posts and

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,720
so forth out there about how to find an

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,840
interesting project

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,799
and once you do you really want to make

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,320
sure this is something that you

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,400
will get something we'll get something

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
out of right and so

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,520
do a small thing at first see how the

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
people react

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,360
are they welcoming are they happy to

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
have you are they off-putting do they

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,120
ignore you

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
really make sure that you're committing

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,720
to a project

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
that it makes sense for you to commit to

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,280
then you go ahead and learn new things

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,799
the great thing about open source of

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,799
course is that it really gives you a

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,360
chance to

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:30,000
stretch into areas that you may not have

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,080
a chance to do in your regular job

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,080
and then step three of course add to the

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,720
resume and then get a new role

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,240
uh learning these little things and

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,159
doing these small projects

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,280
in open source gives you

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
that depth of experience that lets you

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,919
find that kind of thing if you want it

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
in an actual job

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,760
so i hope this is illuminated a little

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
bit what's behind

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,960
the question mark in the open source

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,240
gnomes business plan

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
and i hope that you can now use

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
all of the levers at your disposal even

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,400
the ones that don't look big enough

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,240
to try and bend the arc of your career

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,000
narrative towards something great

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,200
everyone's career arc will be different

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,280
because we all want different things

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
we're all here on this earth and in this

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,840
industry

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,280
to do different things that whatever

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,880
yours looks like i hope this talk has

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,360
left you feeling a little more empowered

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,400
to start

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,400
moving it in the right direction for you

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,039
so for me all that remains is to say

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,120
thank you very much

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,640
for having me here at all things open

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
and for coming to this talk today we do

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,440
have a bunch of time for

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,000
questions um and discussion

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,640
should you want to do that so let me

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,440
first put my contact info

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,720
up on the screen again there we go and

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
as i mentioned at the beginning

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,559
please do feel free to contact me

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,520
privately if you'd like to discuss

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,280
but i'm also open to having a discussion

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,640
here and now

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:13,440
if people have questions so

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:17,039
if you have them you could

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,039
i believe put them in the q a

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,200
we have a question uh how might you go

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
about finding projects to commit to and

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,120
that's a great

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,080
question um

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,920
i think there are a number of ways to go

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,039
about it

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,559
[Music]

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
and i recognize that not everyone is

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,720
going to be have the situation that i

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,159
was in where

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,320
an open source project shows up in your

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:49,120
office

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,120
right so uh a lot of times

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,120
in other situations what i've done is

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
that i will look at the technology i'm

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,600
working with

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
um or the technology that my team is

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,840
working with

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,080
and i look for projects that are

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,360
um at least in that technology realm

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,720
right so i have some

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,720
point of reference for um how i might

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,840
contribute

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,960
another thing you can do is to

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:22,320
there is a special

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,159
leaderboards and things of open source

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,159
projects that

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,000
sort of volunteered themselves to be

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,080
welcoming to newcomers

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
and they may not be in the same

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
technology space that you're in right

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
now but maybe there's one that's in a

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
technology space you're trying to get

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
into

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,799
um i'm sorry i can't remember what the

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,159
name of the um

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,400
of the organization is right now but

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,960
there's an organization that has

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
uh that maintains a list of open source

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,880
projects that are looking for new

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,919
contributors

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,000
um and another way to think about it

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,039
another way to look for projects also is

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
to

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,840
look for projects that you use in your

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,840
day job

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,760
and see if

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,039
there are opportunities there you might

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,679
even be able to do

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,679
during work

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,480
so there's a number of ways to go about

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,000
it i tend to

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,039
to evaluate projects based on

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,840
people so

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,640
um i'm less concerned these days anyway

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,400
about

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,000
whether or not i know the technology and

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
more about whether or not i

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
like the people and the way that i

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
determine that because most the time

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,720
obviously they're not going to be in the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,600
office with me especially not now

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,960
is that i look at their github and i

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,960
look at

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
how they respond to issues right are

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
they are they welcoming

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,000
are they um interested in people are

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,799
they dismissive are they argumentative

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
um are they insulting you'd be surprised

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,200
how many

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,200
how many uh you you find

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,200
and basically i filter that way i look

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,039
at how they treat their

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,320
um their contributors uh which is all

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,840
out in the open on on github and

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
make a decision based on that

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,520
good question

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,840
i believe there's also a chat

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,840
teacher let's see if i can pull that up

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,919
i don't think we have any questions in

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,840
the queue right now but um as a reminder

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,840
um attendees can use the q a window

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,080
the chat window or they can raise their

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
hand

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,279
so we have about

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,320
15 minutes 18 minutes rather remaining

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,799
if you would like to use that for

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,799
questions

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:21,840
or discussion if you have a

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:21,840
an experience you'd like to share

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,240
yeah irena has an interesting point here

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,000
about um

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,520
i wasn't at the actual conference last

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,600
year but um when conferences

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,159
come back and are our thing again that's

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,559
obviously actually often a place that i

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
find projects because you know sometimes

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,440
the people are there so i can sort of

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,200
evaluate

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,240
um folks

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,760
you know just face to face um if not

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,520
sometimes they have like little

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,559
hack days or you know hack windows of an

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,080
hour or two where

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,760
the core team will be in the room and

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,520
you can go

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,880
talk to them and see what kind of stuff

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,000
they're looking for

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,880
so um certainly in-person events are

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,840
a great way to try and find projects as

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,080
well

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,520
um if not really a realistic one right

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,159
now hopefully it will be again

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,159
someday soon

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,919
uh we have a question in the q a can i

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,600
move my regular job to full-time open

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,799
source development

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,600
um there are people who manage to do

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,980
that

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,159
um i know several i think the

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,600
[Music]

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,679
i've never been super interested in that

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,679
myself because i like

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,799
um i like having

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,279
direct customers for my work

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,279
um but uh

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,480
the people i've seen be successful

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,679
at doing full-time open source

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,720
are really good at explaining

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,159
why it's a business priority for the

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,120
company right you're trying to convince

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
the company

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,159
to spend a not insignificant amount of

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
money

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,840
supporting open source through your

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,640
development efforts

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,720
rather than having you work on uh

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,919
you know stuff that will make the money

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,600
directly

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,600
and so i think if you are going to be

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,799
looking to

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,640
do open source as a full-time thing it's

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,520
definitely

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,080
helpful to be able to present it in the

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,960
terms

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,679
of this is why it's a business priority

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,640
um

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,880
for open source this is why it's

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
important for us to be contributing to

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
this project

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
and there are jobs like that for sure

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,039
even within my company i know there are

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,240
some

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,159
um we have people who work on kubernetes

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,840
and various stuff things like that

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,279
full-time and it's important for us

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
because

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,360
we make heavy use of these technologies

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,880
and so we need to be at the table

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
right um

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,960
but i think yeah people that i've seen

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,320
be successful are the ones who really

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
can explain it in terms of business

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
priorities

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,840
so good luck with that

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,120
um a question uh

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
how i got into speaking and making that

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,720
part of my career

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,480
um slowly over time i guess the answer

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,159
happy it's not super relevant to this

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,679
i'm happy to talk about that later if

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
you'd like to send me an email or dm me

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,080
on twitter i'll definitely

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
chat about that

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,360
uh do you have any advice about having a

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,559
conversation with the boss about your

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
career trajectory and what you're

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
passionate about and suited for without

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,399
painting yourself into a corner of

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,399
someone who's about to leave

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,559
um i've

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,399
i've had i've had more and less

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,039
successful versions of this in my career

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,039
over the years

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,760
and related to this idea that

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,960
in order to get full-time open source

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,559
work it really helps to be able to

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,080
explain the business connection

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,000
to open source i think that

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,760
um if you want to do something that it

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,320
seems like your company doesn't do

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,880
right now right for example um

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,720
i think one way is to come to your boss

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,840
with like

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,320
uh enthusiasm about the topic

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,600
and maybe even curiosity like how would

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,600
this fit in here

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,840
how could this fit in here have you

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,000
heard of anything that we're doing that

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,440
might be relevant to this

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,720
um or coming even with

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,240
like some notes prepared around like

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,360
here's how i think open source would

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
benefit the business

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,080
[Music]

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,760
here's you know here's something i'm

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
interested in working on

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,760
that i think would be great for the

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,360
business and here's why

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,559
that can often turn into

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,559
a position where you are

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,960
doing something new that the company

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,840
hasn't done before now all managers

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,600
it's funny i just i i spent about a year

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,559
being a manager recently and i i just

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,840
got out of it

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,880
um and one of the things i discovered

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,240
this is the first time i've been a

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,480
manager at a big company i've been a

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,320
manager at a small company before but

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,320
big company managing is a whole

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,440
different ball game

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,880
um but uh

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
now i'm back to being an architect thank

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
goodness um but i think that one thing

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
that

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,200
is really helpful for managers is if you

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,080
come with ideas about how this will help

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,679
the business

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,799
then that makes it easier for them to

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,519
sell up right sell to the people that

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,880
um have the money so the people that are

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,480
in charge of the budget

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,960
be like look this is why this is good

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,559
for the business um

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
and the more you can speak that language

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,840
the easier it will be to

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,000
to be able to bring things into your job

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,360
that you want to do without feeling like

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
it also gives the

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
your boss a sense that like you're not

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
leaving you're you're looking you're not

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,080
trying to leave you're looking for ways

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,360
to approve the business that

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,679
exists right um

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,200
and so it sort of takes tends to take

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,600
the the conversation a different

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
direction

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,840
i hope that answered the question i'm

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
not entirely sure that it did

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,120
so we have about 10 minutes left for

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,399
further questions

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,760
or general discussion or however the

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,760
speaker wishes to use the time

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,840
we could sit here in awkward silence

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,840
that would be good too

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,840
we have one new comment in the uh when

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,840
you question rather in the chat window

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
oh no i'm sorry that was already

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
answered

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,359
oh yes i should mention since this is a

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,440
sponsored track that you should look at

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,119
salesforce open source projects

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,560
because we do actually um have a policy

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,760
of

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,839
of uh really working to get new folks

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
involved so if you're in the uh

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,639
we have a lot of projects that are um

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,720
kind of devops oriented and then we also

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,320
have a bunch of front-end stuff so

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,240
if those are if either of those are

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,040
interesting to you you should um

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,919
check out salesforce on github there we

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,520
go

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,520

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,640
