Abstract: An impactful career, one where we lead, motivate, and push the state of the art forward is more than just a series of jobs. It is a narrative that includes our jobs, of course, and many other things as well such as outside projects, schooling, and volunteer work. And it's those things, not the jobs, so much, that often give us the greatest power to shift our career narrative in the direction we want.
