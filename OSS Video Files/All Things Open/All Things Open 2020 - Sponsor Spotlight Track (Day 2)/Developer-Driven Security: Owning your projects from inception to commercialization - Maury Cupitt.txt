Abstract: Triaging and remediating security issues in your projects can be a pain, especially when you’re given a long list of tasks to complete at the end of a deployment. How can we make the build process as seamless as possible for dev teams? Join this session with Maury in a discussion about making developer’s lives easier. Learn how to upgrade components with the least amount of effort, avoid versions that will completely break your project, and how to avoid dangerous components from the get-go.
