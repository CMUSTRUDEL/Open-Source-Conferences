Abstract: SUSE will demonstrate how to take control of your multi-cloud deployment - whether it involves a full PaaS with Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, there are key nuggets that everyone can use in their strategy today. We will show the integration with public and private, multi-cloud, cloud foundry, kubernetes, helm chart repositories, security scanning tools and more. All with a forms and click button approach that makes things quick and easy. It's also extensible! It's got it all, at least we think so.
