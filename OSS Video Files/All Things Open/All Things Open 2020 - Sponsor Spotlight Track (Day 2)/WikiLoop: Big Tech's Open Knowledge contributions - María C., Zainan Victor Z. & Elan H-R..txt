before my name is maria cruz i'm a

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
program manager in the google open

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,799
source program office

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,880
uh here with me is sainan victor zu

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
do you want to introduce yourself hi

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,080
everyone uh this is zainan

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,039
uh and i also go by victor i work on

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
google search

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,720
as the tech lead for uh wikiloop

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,640
project and even

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,880
yeah hi i'm alan um i work with uh

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
um victor and maria on the wikiloop

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
project and i also work

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,840
in google's uh on google's knowledge

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
graph mainly focusing on information

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,399
retrieval

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,760
great and we are going to present today

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
the wikileaks program

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,199
uh it's an umbrella program under which

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
we develop

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,480
tools for wikipedia communities and

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,600
other wiki projects and

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,680
we want to show our framework for which

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,479
is an exploration on how big tech can

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,200
contribute to

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,200
the open knowledge world so

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,720
sorry um this is the agenda for today

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
um we are going to talk briefly about

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,439
the wikileaks program

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,479
uh how wikileaks is machine learning uh

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,520
how we build for community participation

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,680
and then we're gonna have a demo of

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,520
two different tools and we're gonna have

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,119
some time for q a and feedback

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,920
so i'm gonna pass it on to cyan

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
thank you uh thank you maria yeah so the

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,399
project wikiloop

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,000
is set out as a virtual circle uh we

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,360
want to provide data to

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,360
the uh and tools to enhance the

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,479
human editor's productivity and in this

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,520
case uh we mean the wikipedia

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,079
wikipedia is one of the most important

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
uh information source that we use to

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
index and to serve our users in

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
knowledge

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
and we want to contribute and make them

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
all

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,920
machine readable and also improve the

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
editor

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,160
editor's productivity um so this loop

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
allows us to

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
not only contribute to the editors

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
productivity but also

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
so that we can further make use of them

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
make available

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,400
their inputs valuable input to the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,599
institutions academia and researchers

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,160
like ourselves and all the open

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,160
knowledge community next

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
so um what kind of project fits the

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,400
project we group

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
uh we think there's three aspects

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,800
there's one source

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
improvements maximize neutrality and the

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,920
last one would be empower human uh

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
bootstrap and bootstrap machine and i

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,519
will go to each individually

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
each one of them individually can you go

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
to the next slide

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
so the first one being source

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
improvements

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,040
as you know that we strive to make our

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,519
algorithms as powerful as possible to

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,599
extract information

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
at certain point we will be reaching to

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
the bottleneck

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
determined by the noise level noise

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,319
level of the source itself rather than

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,879
how much the algorithms can achieve and

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
at that point we will need to improve

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,640
the source

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
uh reduce the noise in the source level

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
um

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
and uh we see these kind of projects one

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,840
of the first

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,360
group that fits in project leaky loop

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,200
for example

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
for the hard decisions that need to be

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
made across the uh

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
to determine whether this is noise or

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
it's just a

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,760
a valid but unique uh data point

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
uh in the middle circle of the right

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
side um that's when

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
we need the help of the human being so

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,920
that's the first

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
next slide

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,360
and the second part is maximize

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,239
neutrality so as you know google

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
is a a company we want to serve our

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,159
users with the best knowledge

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
and information they need however in

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,040
some areas when opinions are

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,959
largely divided and controversial any

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
fact or opinion choice google made in

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,359
the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
knowledge may be deemed as biased by one

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,199
side

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
and then uh people will be unhappy

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,960
and we don't want to be the in in the

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,919
position of picking sites or we want

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
we want to leave it out to the open

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,440
knowledge community to this to make the

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
decision make the judgment call rather

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
than

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,840
us so the project we could provide a

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,400
provides a means

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
to obtain consensus and maximize their

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,440
uh

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
our neutrality stains by relying on

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
the open knowledge peer-reviewed and

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
self-governed

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
community this is a very unique aspect

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
in the open knowledge world as

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,639
we want to bring value to this community

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,919
to this conference of all things

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,160
open because uh i we know that many of

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
our participant comes from a background

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
of open source

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
and there's consensus needs to be made

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,400
and it's even

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
more it's it's sometimes even more

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,440
intense

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
of a beauty consensus building process

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,280
in the open knowledge world

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,919
and we being the technical contributors

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,440
contributors

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
need to respect that and this is a very

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
interesting

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
point and we have maria may uh share

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
with you

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,960
additional uh experience in our journey

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,360
next slide and the third part

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
i think is most relevant to this session

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
which is the machine

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,160
learning respect a perspective as you

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,600
know machine learning

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,919
lives on relying on the the availability

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
of

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,080
training data and in many aspects

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,280
training data is very very hard

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,039
to obtain so that's a problem for

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
machine learning community but also for

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,520
the

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
community of open knowledge let's take

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,000
the wikipedia editors as an example

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,680
they are for example uh

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
one of the important tasks they do

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,080
is translating good articles from one

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
language to another language right

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
they are mostly doing it by hand before

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,160
the availability

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,479
available ability of translations

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
machine translations but they are doing

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,120
it anyway

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
um this is just work that they are

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,280
passionate about and they are

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
contributing

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
but when when we make this available for

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
example some of the translation even

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
though

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,039
not as good as the level we will provide

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,080
to the user

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,319
who um to the regular user they might be

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
this translation may already be good

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
enough to provide

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,479
help for the editors a little help will

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
go a long way in that case and then it

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,440
can save a lot of time for them

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,000
and uh and also their input when they

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
choose

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,479
what which one to be modified to revise

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
as the translation

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,840
as the translation results that can be

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,160
made available to machine learning as a

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,319
training data so this is the

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,440
one of the ultimate goal that uh why

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
wikiloop is

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,880
very uh valuable both to the open

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,360
knowledge community and also to

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,120
institutions with researchers so this is

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
the third one being

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
we want to bootstrap the user the

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,160
editors with the productivity

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
and we want to be able to make their

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,720
input valuable

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,120
input available to machine so next slide

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
and with that i will hand over to to

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
maria

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,039
thank you so much uh i i'm going to

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,880
exit full screen because i want to show

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,000
you a few things that are

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,199
on the internet um

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,080
so uh for this i wanted to share how we

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
communicated

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,199
this um this program and the tools that

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,440
we are developing

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
to the different wikipedia communities i

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
would say that the

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
the very first

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
thing that comes to mind is to

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,599
communicate early uh

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,879
and and share your ideas from an early

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
stage so that you can get

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,879
input from wikipedians and

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
and build a better tool that is useful

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,520
for everybody

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,000
so um the

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,199
the the first consultation that we had i

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,319
mean the first

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,240
communication was sainan sharing this on

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
the wikipedia on the english wikipedia

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
cafe

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,800
and saying hey i'm working on this tool

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
and the first feedback he got

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,240
was that we needed to change the name of

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
the tool

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
which is now called a wikilook double

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
check it was originally called

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
battlefield and this was because the

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,320
community is really trying to

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,440
find better ways of working together and

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,519
referencing a battle or conflict

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,320
is not a a good principle to have

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
and so the first consultation was asking

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
the community what do you think

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,320
this tool should be called and

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,720
i just wanted to show you what this

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
looks like we had a page created on

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
mental wikimedia which is the project

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
where

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
all meta projects are discussed are

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,360
across

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,560
a language version wikipedias and

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
we talked about how we received this

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,519
feedback from the community and that

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
there were

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
different suggestions for a name and we

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,800
narrowed down

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:34,399
to three different options and

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,519
then we sent a mass message via mental

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,959
wikimedia to

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,000
all of the wikiloop tool users

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,000
and asking them to um to vote on what

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
name they thought was more appropriate

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,240
and this is what a boat looks like so

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,560
under each of the names people

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,440
voted and they expressed what they felt

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,800
was the best idea and so as you can see

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
double check was a by far the favorite

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,000
one

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,360
um so that was one consultation that we

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
had

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
then once we have the name and these

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
squares are not in order so apologies

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
for that

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,120
uh we did more outreach to wikipedians

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
and we said okay we have a name that is

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,800
backed by the community the

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
the tool has been in use for some time

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,519
by wikipedians

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,000
let's talk about it more and so we

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
wrote an article on a newsletter for

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,200
english wikipedia

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
called the signpost which is published

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
monthly

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
and we we talked about what wikiloop is

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,760
we had a

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,800
short gif a small gif here where we show

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,880
how the tool works um and we explain

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,600
how the tool um uses existing

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
machine learning models and and tries to

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
improve

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,560
them um and then we received a lot of

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,279
feedback

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,320
from wikipedians that were reacting to

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
the story

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,480
and some of them shared concerns other

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,760
people said they loved it

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,880
and all in all see seeing this

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
as from a tool development perspective

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,480
it's just great user feedback to have

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,120
because a lot of these

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
comments uh while they can feel a bit

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,399
snarky sometimes

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,680
or sarcastic they are actually providing

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,880
a point to look at that we could improve

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,959
for these tools

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,560
so this is what this conversation looks

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,320
like with the

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,279
wikipedia communities um

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,519
and so that was the story that we shared

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
on the signpost

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
and finally uh we did a request for

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,880
comments

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,839
uh for users of the tool to tell us what

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,160
they

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
we wanted their feedback on uh how to

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,040
build trust levels for users

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,240
and enabling a users to have different

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,320
privileges

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,680
uh depending on how much they use the

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,880
tool and so we

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,560
we described how we

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,160
gave them the design summary and how

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,079
we're thinking about it

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,800
um what each level would enable

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
and then people would again vote and

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,440
offer their comments

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,920
and uh describe how they saw this

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,279
initiative for wikiloop a double check

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,160
and uh yeah so those were the three

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,519
instances

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,279
in which we did this outreach and

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,560
the way that this uh impacted

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
the weekly double check was that we were

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
able to reach the

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,240
100 000 reviews milestone

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,120
i think in september this outreach

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,519
campaign

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,360
with these consultations and the the

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,399
article on the signpost

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,360
uh was carried out during august and

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,639
a all of those actions allowed us to

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
increase

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,480
the user base by 30 so we we gained

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,959
30 percent more users that started to

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
use

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,120
uh wikiloop double check um

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,600
so i think as a conclusion of this

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,079
section of the presentation i would say

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,000
that involving the community early is

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,279
paramount to the success of the tool

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,480
and to its uh to its use and

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,360
incorporation on editor workflows

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
and i think with that i'm gonna pass it

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,440
back to

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,800
sainan who is going to do a

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,399
demo i

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,839
may i present from my computer yes

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,839
so i'm gonna stop sharing

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
for all the audience uh if you're

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,959
interested you can pull up your

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,120
um your browser and then type

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,920
doublecheck.wikiloop.org

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
and then you will get access to our app

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,600
so this is another

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
example and one of our current flagship

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
project

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,639
in uh in the umbrella of wikiloop

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
and it's a vandalism review tool called

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,680
wikiloop double check as

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,360
uh maria just uh uh just introduced to

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
you how it gets its current name

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
before that it was called battlefield

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,440
and with the notion

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
of fighting vandalism altogether and the

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
community liked the tool but didn't like

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,199
the name because they say we want a more

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
collaborative name so we change it to

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,160
double check

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
by the the voting process that mentioned

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
maria mentioned

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,880
i want to show you how it works and why

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,160
it represents the

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,240
um the three p three aspect three

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
criteria as that we mentioned before

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519
which is source

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
improvements max with neutrality and

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,600
also

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,880
uh the bootstrap uh

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,519
empower human and bootstrap machine so

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,720
when you go to this website uh this is a

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,279
tool and uh uh

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,880
it will pull up the uh the most recent

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
one of the most recent edits on

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,279
wikipedia

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,880
and then with that uh you can see that

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,880
uh if we are unsure about whether there

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,959
is a vandalism

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,199
will go with unsure you can mark each

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,720
individual revisions and then

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,440
um and then some of them will be shown

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,920
to you as

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
vandalisms right and if you've

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,959
discovered any vandalisms

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,959
let me refresh

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,720
for example this is one of them apparent

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,959
vandalism just happened one minute ago

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,199
and then if you go to

00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:30,480
wikipedia it just so happened

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:34,000
and then uh it's like it's blanking

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,560
the the editor has been blanking

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
uh the page and add some gibberish on

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,959
the page

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
so it's about obvious vandalism and then

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
you can click should revert to mark it

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,600
as

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,920
a vandalism or a damaging edit and then

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,680
there's a button showing up for you

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,279
to allow you to go to wikipedia on the

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,279
page and then you can publish it and

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,440
then by that you helped remove

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,720
one of noise on the page that's one

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
thing and then

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,560
also the process is done by not machine

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
but by the editors

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
just like you and me or any open

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,920
knowledge contribute

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,560
open knowledge ecosystems this allows us

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,000
to reach

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,839
to to leverage the the power of

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,800
neutrality on the community or

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,639
self-governance there

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,880
and then the third one is that we are

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,480
making this process very easy to

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,880
download or to use api to crawl so that

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
when users are reviewing the vandalisms

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,480
it's easy it's

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,399
uh their input are being made available

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,880
to researchers and

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,680
and and institutions and and and just

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
like all

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,279
other open projects so this is the

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
overall idea

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,079
now one of the most uh hardest problem

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,720
here is to identify potential vandalisms

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,199
because in on average as we

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,000
as we do uh random sample and human

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,079
labeling

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
we found that about uh one percent to

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,440
five percent depending on timing locale

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
topics one percent to five percent of

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,480
all edits

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,120
are vandalisms or uh damaging edits

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
but if you uh if you would like to ask

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,679
everyone individual pers

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
uh reviewers to go through every 20 or

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,079
even 100 edits so only to

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,039
identify one of them being vandalisms

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
that's

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,880
not only just boring but also

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,760
unpredictable productivity

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
productive so we leverage things like

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,600
ores

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,880
a vandalism detection score on wikipedia

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,960
or by the wmf team and use that to

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
filter out some of the more likely

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,200
vandalism added

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,200
more likely added that being that could

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
potentially be vandalism and ask people

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
to

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,440
uh to review that improves even people's

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,480
productivity motiva

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,360
motivates editors and um

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
what's you might ask okay in that case

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,280
isn't that uh

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
creating a feedback loop that uh machine

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,799
learning models is just

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
reinforcing itself that's right in this

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,200
case it's

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,440
it's possible however we also provide a

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
portion of the edits as purely random

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
samples so we maintain

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,240
a unbiased uh

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
stream of labels that is not interfered

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
by the

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
machine learning algorithm as long as we

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,919
keep that portion of

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080
a reasonable amount so that users are

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,880
still having a high productivity

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,000
but also there's a a good enough amount

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,280
of vendor

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,240
labels that are being contributed from

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
uh from a random sample and future work

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,200
will include

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,000
us to discover or to choose

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
intelligently choose the revisions for

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,919
label

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,320
uh by those that is closer to boundary

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
of

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,679
vandalism for example they're either

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,559
very likely

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,720
they're very unlikely to uh be valid and

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,760
more very likely to be vendors

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
either one of them would already be uh

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
covered by the machine learning models

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,240
we need to

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,120
we can make more uh model improvement by

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,520
focusing on uh by use applied approaches

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
like

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,080
active learning so that's the overall

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,840
case and with that i want to hand back

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
to maria

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,600
i think you are muted yes

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
i think you need to stop sharing screen

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,840
okay so

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,799
cool yeah uh

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,039
what would you mind uh presenting the uh

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
uh or i'm sorry i i can't i can also

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:53,840
present i

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,840
had some difficulty earlier

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,840
yeah so um just some background uh

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,280
so one thing one uh current problem in

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,280
the the wiki community

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
is that despite growing readership

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,919
there's been a

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,840
decline in editorship over uh for

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:17,280
the you know the past uh 10 years or so

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,559
um and based on exit studies and just

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,320
um talking to

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,840
the community um it's well known that

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,480
there's a problem with uh

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,159
toxicity um rude comments and just

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
incivility between

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,840
passionate editors which has led some

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,960
some people to

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,360
to um stop volunteering their time

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,799
and as proponents of the open knowledge

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,880
ecosystem we

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,240
really want to you know try and address

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,520
this just to

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,240
um improve the number of active people

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,720
he

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,000
involved to improve both the coverage

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,799
and the quality

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
um so this summer um we had three very

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,520
talented

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,400
interns who um decide to tackle this

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,240
problem

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,559
um and in a simple in a approach similar

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,679
to

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,559
double check using machine learning

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
to empower editors to address this issue

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,679
themselves

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
so you know the next slide

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,440
so some of you may be familiar with uh

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,880
project jigsaw um essentially this is

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,559
a um project with an uh

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,440
open api to try and um

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
address incivility on the web and this

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,039
is just

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
a you know a machine learning model to

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,200
cloud

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,039
do text classifications um so

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,200
uh you just take take some sample text

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,880
input into the model and you get scores

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
for a number of different dimensions

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
including toxicity

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
sexually explicit um identity attacks

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,200
etc

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,200
um and we for for

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,280
civility check we just use this signal

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,720
and put in the hands of wiki editors to

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,559
try and

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,679
um improve discourse in the community

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,280
um so uh similar to

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,159
um double check there's in no cases does

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,159
the does this tool take action on behalf

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
of users or take automated actions

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,960
it's just a tool to help improve

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
throughput and make people more

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,600
efficient

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,480
currently there are around two edits per

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
second

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
on wikipedia so it's intractable for

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,919
editors to try

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,640
and monitor these um themselves in that

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,520
end

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,120
so rather than being proactive in

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
addressing incivility everything is

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,520
reactive based on

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
user reports so um this these typically

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,799
have a long

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,919
delay before someone actually steps out

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,760
in addressing them

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,720
so this tool aims to quickly detect

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,679
toxic behavior and then send a friendly

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
reminder

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
to say hey you know you know we're all

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
in the same

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,080
team we're trying to you know improve

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,200
this system and like

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,200
if need be escalate this or give the

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,760
give users of the tool an option to

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,960
escalate this to um

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,440
to uh community moderators um

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,480
and we're currently uh running on a

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
reduced uh

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,080
api so we're only processing a certain

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
subset of

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,559
of um wiki uh edits and comments

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:31,039
but once we move this to production we

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:34,000
aim to scale up so uh next slide

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,400
uh thanks yeah so this is just a overall

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
view

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,120
we just we requiring the wikimedia api

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,200
um to get uh comments and

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,640
uh revisions sending it to get

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,000
classified by

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,039
the perspective api and then um

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
publishing them to to our tool

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,480
um in a variety of different views um so

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
next time

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,200
um so here's just a demo of um what a

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,039
user will see

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,159
uh essentially since we aim to try and

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,559
you maximize the um

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,279
of the volunteers time and throughput we

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,039
show them the

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,120
things that are most likely to be toxic

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,120
to be addressed immediately and

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,039
they are in descending order over a

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,480
windowed period of time

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,520
um and from here we can see which what

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
how how confident our model is in it

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,919
being in civil

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,000
which revision was um

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,520
was the cause which user did it what the

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,720
comment was and where

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,039
it was so from here we can then go on to

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,760
an action view similar to double check

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,760
in the next slide

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,039
and um here um

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,880
here we allow the user to take action

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,320
you can either mark it as good

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,919
so that this was a this is a

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,039
false positive um we can similarly say

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
you know whether

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,799
we're just unclear without the context

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
and whether you should report this and

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,600
this will it can take

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,679
the user to um the um

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,039
the user page to send the templated

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,679
reminder saying hey

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
you know here's uh here's our guidelines

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
on

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,799
uh um uh user interactions and

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,400
our civil civility guidelines and

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,640
um also if um if necessary

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,559
we can report this to the administrator

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,159
notice board um

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,600
so like all machine learning models

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,720
um the perspective api isn't perfect

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,159
and we currently get uh false negatives

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,039
and false positives

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
but we um similarly uh provide the

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,520
mechanisms

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,360
to um label these and

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,760
um in the process of improving um

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,799
wiki discourse we aim to create an open

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
data set

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,520
for uh civility as well so

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,200
um previously um

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,559
there were there there was an issue with

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,520
um

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,799
what with um some some potential bias in

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,799
this model

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,880
the wiki community brought this up and

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,080
then it had since been addressed by the

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
perspective team

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:21,200
so um creating this uh creating

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,640
um this this part or virtuous feedback

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,960
loop between oh

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
using this model to improve editor's

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
throughput

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,440
and then also using the results to

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,799
produce um

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,360
better more accurate models um yeah

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
this this is one of the the these are

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,919
the main goals

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,039
um for this for this project um and uh

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,720
next next slide so um

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,480
we we spoke to um some of some of the uh

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
team members at the wikimedia foundation

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
and they provide some valuable feedback

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,240
like the

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,360
the most useful um aspect of this tool

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,520
would be able to

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
you know do some aggregate stats on

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,200
individual users

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,679
um so mainly for administrators who have

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
like

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
who have heard okay you know this this

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,559
user may be um

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,760
acting inappropriately let's try and get

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,159
some uh

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,960
high-level stats to uh or let's look

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,520
over there

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,159
their full history and see whether this

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,000
is was a one-off event or potentially

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,559
um a uh um just

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
how how they interact on in in the

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,320
community

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,240
um so yeah so so it's similar to the

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,240
original page but just um also gives

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,279
like average incivility which

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,159
um can be a pretty good metric um

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,760
and uh may be a good rule of thumb of

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,919
like okay maybe

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
we may eventually want to look at okay

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
we found that this is systematic

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,480
behavior by these editors and then flag

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,520
these as well

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,559
um so that's uh that's it for uh

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,320
civility check

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,840
um we currently um are still working on

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,159
introducing it to the community

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,399
um we um we did a few presentations and

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,840
um have had some feedback and like how

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,159
to make it more useful

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
um we're also looking at um scaling it

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,919
up um

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,159
currently we're we're uh we're facing

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,640
some uh bottleneck issues um with our

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,520
current

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
uh api restrictions but um we're looking

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
to looking to fix those before

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
introducing it to the the wider

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,919
community but yes that's

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,799
that's it on this thank you

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,760
hi i'm sorry to interrupt and i'm sorry

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,720
for the

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,799
confusion my latest schedule lists this

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,440
as three separate sessions

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,279
with three speakers um so that's why i

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,840
was confused when we started

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,279
so as far as a q a session goes how

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,799
exactly would you like to run it

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,520
and um um will there be two more

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,880
sessions

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,880
after after this

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,720
uh no so this is uh

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,720
this decision i'm i'm not able to hear

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,720
you i'm i'm sorry oh

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,559
uh i wonder why um you you can't hear me

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,919
at all i can hear you a little better

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,039
now yeah okay

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,320
cool yeah so this is the the one session

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,320
um that that we have uh i

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,200
i yeah i don't know how this um

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,960
disconnects uh happened but yeah we we

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,880
just have this one session and now i

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,399
think we're ready for

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,080
q a and feedback um okay

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,880
so i would say i would say take all the

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,320
time you want

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,399
with um q a if you go past 12 15.

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,440
uh that's fine i'm sure they will still

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,640
keep recording

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,760
and everything will be um

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,320
in a session so

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,799
again i'm sorry for the confusion and to

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,919
the

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,039
um attendees you can ask a question

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,520
uh three ways you can use the zoom

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
chat window you could use a zoom q a

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,200
window

00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,320
or you can raise your hand and we'll

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,279
recognize you so yeah we could begin the

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,279
q a session now

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,000
thank you yeah so if you have any even

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
if you don't have questions if you have

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
any comments or ideas

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,279
that were inspired by the presentation

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,679
we'd love to hear them

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
as well

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,240
yes feel free to use this online venue

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,399
for any general discussion

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,799
you wish to have for pretty much as long

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
as you need

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,000
are any of you here attending the

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,840
session familiar with wikipedia and how

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,840
wikipedia works

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
um

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,039
we're also looking for uh comments

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,360
questions regarding how

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,600
human interactions creating training

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,720
data in your space because we know the

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,360
audience is

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,279
uh many of you are specifically

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,399
interested in how machine learning

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,200
uh can uh work with the open source

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,519
or all things open right so if you in

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,360
your own

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,559
domain has uh challenges

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,320
in creating training data or uh you have

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,399
encountered an open knowledge

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,159
that would be also very valuable we look

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,799
for questions

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,799
comments inputs suggestions anything

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
yeah

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,519
so mike uh i have not used uh the

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,399
webinar

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,279
features i if the audience raised hands

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,840
or

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,880
type things or are they able to speak

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,880
into the microphone

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,080
um if they want to request speaking um

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,760
yes uh most people use

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,760
the zoom chat window which kind of

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,240
becomes part of a public

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,320
conversation or they use a q a window

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,799
which is private in that

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,679
i believe only you get it and we check

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,960
off questions

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,960
as they are answered

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
as an open source advocate i'm happy to

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,159
see

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,279
um more structure entered into programs

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,000
like mediawiki

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,840
i know sort of the original point of it

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,640
was to not have it too structured and to

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
have it

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,000
free flow but i i think there's so much

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,880
information out there that i can

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,360
really respect what uh the company is uh

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,120
doing

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
to um organize it a little more

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,799
so that would be that would be my

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,360
comment as a

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,360
moderator

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:54,080
thank you um

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,360
yes i can i can share a bit more

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,279
about how we how we organize and present

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,799
this to the community because i think

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,919
this is the

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,399
the tricky part usually when working

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,159
uh or developing something for a

00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,080
wikipedia um

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,600
it's usually how do you reach the

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
community how do you

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
tell them hey we're here we're making

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,200
this um

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,039
so this is the the landing page that we

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,120
have on meta wiki

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,039
where we describe what wikiloop is and

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,760
this is a very similar definition that

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,799
we shared on the slides

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,440
we list the tools that are active and

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,760
then

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,760
we have a tab for each of the

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,320
the most active ways of participating

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,320
and people can sign up

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,679
to show support etc um

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:52,880
i think i may be even able to show

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:56,399
what was the first um

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,399
the first interaction like

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,760
[Music]

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,760
here yes

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,159
um this is just a talk page

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,159
on uh wikipedia um

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:20,800
a it's the top page of the tool

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,560
on english wikipedia um

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,720
it's i mean i think it's it's a lot to

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,919
go through and sometimes it can feel

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,480
overwhelming um but

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,520
uh being able to navigate this is

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,440
actually what

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,480
uh sometimes makes the tool really

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,520
relevant for

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,440
wikipedians and and

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
makes them want to use it which is what

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,800
what we want so

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,159
yeah uh i think we have a question let

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,720
me see

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,159
we do have a question in the q a window

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,119
yes

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,119
from mg

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,119
so this may not be related but is there

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,119
a long hanging fruit

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,119
in terms of an easier contribution for

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,400
someone completely new

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,400
but interested in tech

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:20,960
well you could try to review wikipedia

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,960
using wikiloop double check um

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,040
so if you it depends on what your skill

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,880
sets

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:35,760
uh what your skill set is um

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,560
so i it's kind of hard to to give advice

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,079
without knowing that but what we usually

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,640
tell people who want to get more

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,920
involved in tech

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,720
if they are interested in a project um

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,359
connecting through the documentation of

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,680
the project

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,839
is usually a good way to start to

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,359
contribute to an open source project

00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,480
um because that helps you to to learn

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,520
um how the project works

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,920
um and how you can make it work for you

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,680
and sometimes it's usually the case that

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,440
open source projects

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:15,200
um have work to do on documentation um

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,040
there's sometimes there isn't a any

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,320
budget sometimes people are too busy

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,200
developing

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,720
new features and so coming in as a new

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,079
person and getting involved through

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,599
documentation can be

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,440
helpful um to the project as well

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,320
because you can point to things that are

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,320
out of date

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,640
or things that are not working for you

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,000
and contributing that way and

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,520
in the meantime learn about the

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,240
technology that's an easy way of

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,520
or an easier way of getting involved in

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,560
in open source in an open source project

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,880
you could also try editing wikipedia if

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,880
you like

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,079
doing that kind of work and making

00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,720
information available

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:04,480
with an open source license um

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,880
yeah i think those are the two things

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,400
that come to my mind

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,160
yeah i i would also um say if you

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,119
um if you are aiming to make technical

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
contributions

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,359
yeah the uh wiki project is all open

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,119
source and they have a um

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,560
they have a uh fairly plentiful

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,960
um outstanding issues uh page um

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,320
that can be that you can you could call

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
saying like hey you know i want to work

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
on this and you know submit pull

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,200
requests

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,240
um also um a lot of the tools that the

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,760
community

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,960
uses are um

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,520
similarly um you know

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,640
happily accept um outside technical

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,040
contributions

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
but also if you if you know more than

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,000
one language one of the

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,040
the biggest um things you can uh provide

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,040
um to improve the wikipedia tooling is

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,680
providing translations and then that

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:09,520
that can be a very um easy

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:13,119
or a low um an easy entry point into

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,960
um improving uh these open source wiki

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,480
tools is like oh you know

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,000
here's a translation now i'm already

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,880
looking into the the source

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
code and such and um and then just you

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,359
know

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
using that as a way of providing back to

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,240
the community because um

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,560
yeah i one thing i've learned um

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,240
as a wiki editor is that it is currently

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,079
wikipedia exists on because of manual

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,119
labor there's a lot of things that

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,800
could be improved could be automated but

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,839
they're just

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
they there there hasn't been the uh the

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,320
um

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
the tech technical or the the um just

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
the

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,280
the time for the the few wiki editors

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,920
who are particularly technical

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,200
minded to um create tools to address

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
these things so if you see something

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,320
that you you think

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,920
oh hey this could be automated and i

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,400
know you know

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,720
i know enough javascript or i you know

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,040
want to look up the python wikibot and i

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,480
would

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,119
you know do this like the the community

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,160
would

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,240
would love to be happy to have your

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,599
assistance um as long as you like give

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,079
them a heads up before you run

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,560
start running a bot that does you know

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,000
tens of thousands of edits so

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,520
yeah yeah i would i would check out pie

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,079
wikibot if it's

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,960
if you're looking at a very easy way of

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
like

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,760
accessing wikipedia from a programmatic

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,760
banner

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,000
yep and one other thing that you can

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,560
definitely try it out is to go to

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,560
doublecheck.wikiloop.org and then start

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,079
reviewing vandalisms and or other

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,599
damaging edits

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,480
uh this is one thing that the community

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,680
hasn't

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,960
been asked a lot and then they look for

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,119
their co-contributors to help with that

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,040
as well so yeah that's definitely easy

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,839
and then feel free to if you are

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,000
technically

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,079
enough uh feel free to send us pull

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,599
requests to improve the tool or any

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,400
other tool just like uh

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,400
elon says

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,319
yeah feel free feel free to to

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,560
