	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
yeah i think this one is a

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
different it's just about kind of the

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
books i've written and stuff and some

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,839
comments about there

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,279
i'm happy to uh to share anything i just

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
wanted to make sure everybody is aware

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
this is a session about just kind of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
open-ended

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,920
about the books and stuff and not a sort

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
of technical instruction

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
section here but uh uh david did you

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,519
want to say anything else you want me

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,079
just to launch into it here

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
so i just i just uh posted the link to

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,640
sign up for the book there i'll also be

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
posting it

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
uh often throughout the session just

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,160
because some people come and go

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
fantastic it's good to have a top of

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
mind but you know james uh has already

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,520
asked a question there is a q a

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,440
section down there at the bottom if

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
you'd like to ask questions they're

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
asking what's the difference between

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
jenkins and jenkins x

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
well it's a that's a good question james

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,280
and uh so jenkins

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
is the traditional sort of orchestration

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
workflow tool

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
out there there's actually a couple

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
incarnations and i'll try

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
if i start rambling on too much someone

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,119
can throw a virtual fruit at me or

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
something like that

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,920
or yell or something but basically

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,159
jenkins was the original sort of

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
workflow thing to automate things like

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
builds and stuff the

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
the guy who created it uh i actually

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,920
said he got tired of being the person

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
who broke the builds

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
so he wrote it and it was a big web as a

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
web interface tool and you would go into

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
the web and you select drop down you

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
would fill in radio

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
buttons or fill in forms those kinds of

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,799
things jenkins 2 which is what the uh

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
the book was about the second book that

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,119
i wrote

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
was more along the lines of of kind of

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,840
explaining

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
some of the basics of jenkins but also

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
talking about pipelines as code that is

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,799
the idea

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
that being able to um

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
create these pipelines that take your

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,000
code from source code

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
through the build process through

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,079
testing process

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,520
through other kinds of validation stuff

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,119
to produce something that is a

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,719
deployable product

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
being able to do that in jenkins but

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
being able to write it like you might

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,479
write a program or you might

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,319
write a script out there and being able

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
to store it in source management systems

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,039
like git

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,480
and such so that was kind of the focus

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,760
of that pipelines as

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,599
code as opposed to tying a bunch of web

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
jobs and web forms together to do your

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,480
pipeline jenkins x

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,720
is bearish very little resemblance to

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,319
jenkins even these days this was

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
um the idea that we want to be able to

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
create these ci cd

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
pipelines these continuous integration

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,000
continuous delivery pipelines

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,319
to take our code from that source code

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
through the build test all the processes

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,640
and be able to automatically deploy it

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,239
into kubernetes

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
and any of you who've heard the

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,480
kubernetes term know about containers

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
jenkins x simplifies taking your code

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,519
and automatically packaging it up as a

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
container

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
wrapping it up for those of you to know

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
what helm is generating helm charts

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
and stuff with it and deploying it out

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
into the kubernetes cluster and running

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
it there

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,239
so in essence you can create the cic

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
pipelines in any of the clouds any of

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
the kubernetes environments

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,519
with just a couple of commands in there

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,959
and it's actually

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,000
um the topic of my next book

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,920
uh but it's on hold right now while the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,720
company that works with jenkins x

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,959
cloudbees

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
is kind of revamping the product or

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
going on there so i've got

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
probably three quarters overwritten but

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
we're waiting to for them to kind of get

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
to the next version to see what they

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,000
change

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
so i can finish that up but

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
uh dumb it down for an off sky

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,599
you guys are doing the real work there

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
huh those are those are fighting words

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,680
i'm just going to ignore that

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
yeah yeah exactly exactly a question

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
from patrick that says

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
are there any new trends on branching

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,799
strategies like git flow or trunk based

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
development

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,720
oh wow uh new trends

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
not so much that i know of i mean git

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
flow has been out there for a long time

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
in terms of branching

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
uh we've you know i i don't i tried to

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
kind of steer clear that

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
in the professional git book that i

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
wrote in terms of espousing one or the

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,720
other i will say

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,519
there is a book called uh

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,479
well this is called accelerate written

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,960
by the devops institute

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,400
excuse me not one of my books but done

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
by the devops institute

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,440
and they talk about the key things that

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,280
they have

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,720
found which are uh you know useful to

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
companies and have really helped

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
accelerate them and help celebrate their

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,280
growth and stuff

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,160
devops practices and their their

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,320
position is they always use

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,040
the trunk you know work on the trunk or

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,800
the the master branch in git

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
and work in there and then branch out

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
from there uh but

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,450
i don't know if there's any new trends

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
out there certainly get the work

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,080
[Music]

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
typical workflows and stuff have been

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
out there get flow for a while

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
in there i think though in general as

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
long as you're working off of the master

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
branch

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
you're probably up with where

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
people like the devops institute and

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
stuff would say you are i should be

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,880
working

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,759
sorry i've got some sunlight coming in

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
here on me

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
yeah it's it's it's uh it seems like a

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
very difficult life that you're leading

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
um right there trying to avoid sunlight

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
um

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,000
i'm just kind of curious what um what

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,639
sort of got you into the process of of

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,160
writing

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,919
um this book well i you know i have the

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
the two books i did the professional get

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
one and i did the jenkins two up and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,840
running see if that helps a little bit

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,360
um the first one honestly i'd always

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,919
kind of wanted to write a book i've been

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
teaching for a number of years

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,160
and uh i guess you would say almost like

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
a bucket list item or something in there

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
i decided you know

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
i enjoyed teaching enjoy putting it

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,479
together uh

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
and i said well okay let's see if i can

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,360
write a book and

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,720
honestly it was a much larger endeavor

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
but there's a couple of motivation

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,240
factors one is i really love teaching

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,080
and helping people understand things

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
and so i already had a lot of the

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
material i'd done from get classes over

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,160
the years so i was able to

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,680
draw that together use a lot of the same

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,120
illustrations and stuff

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
and the other thing quite honestly that

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,199
gets me into doing this kind of stuff

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
if i have to teach other people i had

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
better know it myself

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
so i have to learn it myself and i have

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
to figure it out

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,080
and you know that's that's a that's a

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,639
driver for me is okay

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
i can i i feel like i can teach most

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
things if i understand it myself but i

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
really have to dig to understand it

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,360
um so it's it's an interesting

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,440
process there i took me you know mostly

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
a lot of nights and weekends

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
working on it because my day job i'm

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
still doing that as well

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
in there you know and they'll you know

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
i'll i'll say this up front too you

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
don't do these kinds of books for the

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,840
money

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
uh you do it for you know because you

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,479
want to do it and because you want to

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,199
actually

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
uh help other people understand it and

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
the only kind of the

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
the main reward you get from the kind of

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,759
is the reviews and the kind of feedback

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
and stuff for it

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,440
so yeah yeah talking so i've been

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,039
hosting the author track today and uh

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
talking with all the authors

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
basically all of them have said

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
something very similar you know it's

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,080
like a passion project

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,759
um it's uh you know some of them have

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
said you can go buy it off of amazon i

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,520
won't make any money off of that

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,080
one person said that if you bought his

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,440
book maybe he could afford a coffee

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
so that's something um but then he was

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,639
drinking the coffee while he was giving

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,759
the talk so i think in general he's

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,360
yeah yeah exactly yeah

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,120
james is asking and i'm sure you get

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,919
this all the time what is that behind

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
you

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,199
so that thing behind me is called a

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,960
bubble wall

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,560
um there is uh i shouldn't focus

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
plug-in but company on etsy that makes

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
them uh it's supposed to be bubbling in

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,199
all the chain version right now there's

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
a couple of them broken

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,680
this was a thing that my i got from my

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
wife to put in her office and for some

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
reason she thought it looked better in

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
mind so

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,960
there you go i have it in here um

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,560
but it is just a little decoration or

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
something different

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
in here i thought it was maybe a

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
visualization of some

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,919
commits you know and the the broken

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,599
columns were like a build nut

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,360
you know i'm sure you could probably do

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,279
that i've known of people i've heard in

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
the past i think they used like uh

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
lava lamps uh and stuff to do that you

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
know like when the build when the lava

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,919
lamp was red the build was broken

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
that kind of thing or when it was green

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
it was good so i'm sure they probably

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
do have something with that or can

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
change colors periodically but yeah

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,519
that's a good idea i could actually hook

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,279
it up but the builds were broken or

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
oh it's blue now i don't know what that

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,440
means yeah i know

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
i know yeah john is actually asking how

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
much easier is it

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,240
in jenkins x versus jenkin file uh

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
for using different pipe or pipeline

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
stages in regular jenkins i think there

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
might be a grammar issue but did you

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
catch that

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
i uh you know i'm not seeing that one

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
maybe i'm missing some

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
so it's actually if you scroll to the

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,000
bottom of the screen there's a q a

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,120
uh yeah oh okay the q a i'm looking

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
still in the chat

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
that's what it is i've been working on

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
oh yeah

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
okay got it uh how much easier is it in

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,160
jenkins x versus jenkins file

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,399
uh use for pipeline stages in

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,200
regular jenkins uh it's easier

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,720
with the jenkins file out there from the

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
standpoint of once you get it working

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
now what i typically do is i will

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,480
kind of develop it in jenkins in a

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
pipeline

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,000
uh type of project and then i if that's

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
what you're

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
asking uh john i'll typically go into

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,480
jenkins and

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,399
write my code in the application itself

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
as a pipeline type of project

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
which allows me to kind of test it embed

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
it there

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
and then i'll go and save it off as

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
jenkins file

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
if you're writing with jenkins file for

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,880
those of you who aren't familiar with a

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,560
jenkins file is

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,640
it's essentially your pipeline expressed

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,440
as code much like a program

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,519
in there you can either write the code

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
in jenkins itself

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,279
in a pipeline project or you can just

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,120
store it in a jenkins file

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,120
and store that in git as a text file

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,040
and the challenge with it if you only

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
ever do it as a jenkins file starting

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,040
out

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
is you've got to then

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
kind of put it somewhere where jenkins

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
can see it and run it

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
typically and get and try to exit and

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
then if you have a problem with it

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
go back and use an editor to update it

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,120
and such there are

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
some ways you can kind of get around

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
that a little bit but

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
i typically develop it as a pipeline

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
project in jenkins itself

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
and then store it out convert that to a

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,519
jenkins file when i'm sure it's running

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
well

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
uh let's see guys questions we currently

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,680
use regular jenkins to create images and

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
deploy to openshift we use kubernetes is

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,760
this something that would be an easy

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
transition

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,920
from regular jenkins pipeline stored in

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,000
source code repositories

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,320
um if by regular jenkins

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
you mean just the traditional kind of

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
non-pipeline

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
or non-pipeline as code jenkins out

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,200
there

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,360
yeah it can be a little bit i mean if

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
you can express it in what you do it can

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
be a little bit

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,240
of a transition there essentially

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
i was trying to remember i think there

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
is something

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
i think there is a plugin that allows

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,839
you to actually take jenkins

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,519
projects and convert them to pipeline as

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,839
code

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,440
depending kind of on the complexity it

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
might be a bit of a challenge i mean one

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,000
thing you might do

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,680
is start just to kind of stub out a

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,160
pipeline a code

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,760
in a in a pipeline project and then kind

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,639
of fill it in with the pieces as you go

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
along

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,600
and maybe add that processing in as you

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,720
go along

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,120
there are examples i have in the

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,639
book of how to do that so you might take

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,920
a look at those that might help as well

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
i think it was asking if they could be

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,519
an easy transition to jenkins x

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,200
oh i see what you're saying now so sorry

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
john i didn't understand the question

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
quite you already have the pipelines as

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
code it

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,760
it should be the answer is it should be

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,720
but here's what's happened jenkins x

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,880
originally had

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,720
two ways of doing jenkins things one was

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,440
by using

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
a jenkins instance to run in other words

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
when it needed to do a pipeline

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,240
processing

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
it would spin up a jenkins instance and

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
it would actually run things with the

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
pipeline as code

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
it would go through and do that over

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,800
time they've moved away from that

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,079
they've actually deprecated it and which

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
is kind of an unfortunate

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,560
take from my standpoint they've gone to

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,839
something called tecton pipelines

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,720
uh techton if you haven't heard of it

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,839
t-e-k-t-o-n is a way

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,279
of writing pipelines more

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
as kubernetes uh aspects uh

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,240
cooper by writing them sorry kubernetes

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,320
native they use actually kubernetes

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
kind of primitives and stuff to write

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
pipelines in there

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
jenkins x will do all that for you it'll

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,519
produce your pipeline

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
my point being when they were actually

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
running with a jenkins

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,600
master a separate instance of jenkins

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,480
you could have taken your pipeline code

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,680
and pretty much just use that option

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
through jenkins x

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,320
but since they've now deprecated it and

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,800
gone to using techcon pipelines

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,560
uh it's not as easy but you could

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
probably still

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
if you spend a little time learning some

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
of the stuff they do and things there's

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
a

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,040
there is a language that they use so

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,160
jenkins x will actually

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,600
allow you to do a uh write your

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,600
pipelines

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,760
in a language that is similar to the

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,399
declarative syntax of jenkins

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
x of jenkins ii if you know that declare

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,639
see there is a way to write your

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
pipelines

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,519
in a similar syntax and then jenkins x

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,639
will turn it into tecton

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,920
so probably not too far off but it's not

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,880
as easy as just picking them up and

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,480
dropping them in

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,519
you'd have to spend a little time making

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,360
sure you could translate it

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:31,199
uh let's see what else do we have

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,880
james is asking about your your day job

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,480
which you're under no obligation to

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,320
answer uh is

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,079
sas into kubernetes uh i i guess i can

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,880
talk a little bit about this

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,120
uh and understanding that if i um

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,800
i don't i do not represent sas here in

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,600
this capacity i mean i have type but

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,720
my day job is a r d director at a devops

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
organization

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,800
uh sas is doing yeah we're doing a lot

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,240
with kubernetes now

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,920
we are uh coming out with a new set of

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,000
software our via software

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,000
that will be cloud native and run there

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,760
so this has been an interesting journey

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
going something that wasn't cloud native

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
to that and really we've kind of

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
really kicked into high gears our devops

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,519
organization and doing a lot of exciting

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,959
things and that's really if you really

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
want to learn

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,800
you know kubernetes those kinds of

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
things devops take something that wasn't

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,399
designed for that

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
and then convert it to do that take

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,920
something to piece of software

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
that wasn't initially designed to run in

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
a cloud-native way

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
uh in a stateless way and work on

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
converting it and you'll learn a lot

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
that way yeah boy that would be funny if

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
the answer to that question was like we

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,199
just don't believe in kubernetes at sas

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,240
we uh you know don't really use it at

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,839
all no no we are we are fully on board

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
with the cloud native and making sure

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
our customers can run it in

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
the software and cloud native and take

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,279
advantage of all the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,120
uh functions out there yeah that's

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,880
awesome so anybody else with any

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
questions feel free to ask them either

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,759
in the chat

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,320
or in the in the q a section of

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
zoom here i see that we actually have

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
really

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,040
high attendance i think this is the best

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
attended talk um

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,199
that we've had in the author training

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,160
today uh so congratulations

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,240
well fantastic i appreciate that yeah uh

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
you know and i i

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
so hopefully i don't know if most people

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
are interested in the get book or the

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,759
jenkins 2 book

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,519
oh says is jenkins x3 and can we

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
download it yes you can

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,600
john you can actually download jenkins x

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
and you can uh

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,519
download it and play with it and

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,759
actually there's about

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
first four chapters of the jenkins x

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,560
book i think out on o'reilly

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,160
early preview i think it mostly still

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,000
applies now if you're interested

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,199
um and uh there's also classes i do on

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
o'reilly

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
uh around some of these topics as well

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,079
so

00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:01,120
yeah awesome

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,120
i will mark that as answered yep

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,439
like so you wrote um both of these

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
books did do you see a lot of overlap in

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
the audience for both books or are they

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,319
really targeted at different groups

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,720
really probably targeted at different

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,079
uh different groups out there i mean the

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,760
git book

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,600
i wrote it actually i wrote both of them

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,959
kind of as for the beginner

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,640
for the advanced but i think the get

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,039
book has

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
gotten a lot more feedback on it i will

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,520
say it's been interesting

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,280
that you know i worked with wiley and

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,160
sons for the get book

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,360
and great people to work with there

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
o'reilly

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,039
that was wiley not o'reilly but wiley

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
and then

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
o'reilly i did the jenkins 2 book with

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,039
and

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
uh really you know you kind of get the

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,200
the

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,039
to see the the the marketing and stuff

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,679
that goes along with like the oz con the

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
conferences

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
different things easter they used to

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
have not so much anymore

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,039
but for instance the jenkins 2 book

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,799
while it hasn't had

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
perhaps as great reviews and stuff

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
because of some of the screenshots and

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,919
issues with that

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
by the way if you get the jenkins 2 book

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,039
i highly recommend

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,600
asking for the electronic version

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,280
because the screenshots got kind of

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
washed out when they printed it

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
uh but hopefully that the electronic

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
version i think still looks pretty good

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
but anyway with the jenkins 2 book what

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,000
i was getting at was they actually

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,360
translated that one surprised me

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,240
into um chinese korean and russian

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,039
so i have copies of all of those can't

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
read a word

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,440
out of any of it except my name but i

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,440
can you know so they got translated into

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
other countries and i

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
was really interesting they had me write

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
forwards for that and stuff so that was

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,400
really

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
nice um the professional git book i

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,799
would say has probably gotten wider

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,160
attention there

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,120
typically when i go to conferences

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,840
people are more interested in that

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,440
um different approaches on them or with

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
the professional git book i included

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,280
like hands-on labs

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
and wrote it with like you know beginner

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,200
sections and then advanced

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,000
topics and stuff kind of choose from

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,559
that

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to get the jenkins book is bigger but

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,840
kind of goes through

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
some of the original jenkins stuff and

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,520
explains some of that

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,880
and then through the the newer pieces on

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,080
the end kind of builds

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,400
all the way through but you can kind of

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,559
skip around in it a little more

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
so yeah interesting experiences all the

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,280
way around

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,640
so uh john is asking what about posting

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
a link for the get book

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,039
so it's interesting we we have this uh

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,200
forum and i will post the link again

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,200
in the chat um and the form

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
the book that the forum says uh you'll

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
be um

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,960
expressing interest in is profession get

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,400
jenkins 2 up and running um

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,679
that's two books i don't know well

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,240
it's one book and one misspelled book

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,679
so i don't know exactly which which book

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
you will be getting a copy

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,200
of i think this is something that all

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,440
things open is coordinating

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,640
yeah we'll have to kind of make sure i

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
would say when you put it in if you have

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,600
a way express which book you want to

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
actually

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,799
uh you know you're interested in

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,679
uh maybe that can make sure that's the

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,320
case

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,520
i don't know how many we will have both

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
you know books but

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,760
yeah i don't actually know so i i am a

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,720
lowly volunteer

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,760
moderator and uh i actually have very

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
little influence

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,640
uh in all things open um and uh and i'm

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,000
getting paid very poorly so

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,840
volunteers are fantastic

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
couldn't do it without you guys i mean

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,240
honestly uh this is great

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,320
but yeah if you actually just search for

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,840
my name out on amazon

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,360
you'll be able to find it you'll be able

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,640
to see the book out there

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
that's probably the easiest way i

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
started to post a link but it's taking

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
me to kind of

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,280
some of the other pages here but

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,440
professional it's professional git

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
and then jenkins 2 up and running is the

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,520
other one so if you look for

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
my name out there you'll find it yeah

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
awesome well fingers crossed i hope that

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,080
you get the book that you want

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,740
but you know even if you don't maybe

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,600
you'll get the book that you needed

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,240
[Laughter]

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
we had a question here from lakshmi who

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
asks

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,360
is jenkins x something comparable to

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,039
circle ci could you talk a little bit

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,120
about the ecosystem

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,240
um i'm not sure i'm not familiar with

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
circle ci

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,679
really although as i recall it's more

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,200
it's one of those continuous integration

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
continuous delivery things

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
but i would be you know speaking out of

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,679
a lack of knowledge i try to talk about

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
it too much

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:40,480
um jenkins jenkins x

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,960
is more about setting up the pipelines

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
to run in a cloud environment whereas

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
something like jenkins

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
or i'm thinking circle ci or travis is

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
another one out there

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,000
people integrate with those are all sort

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,600
of the defining the pipelines

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,679
themselves like the build tests and

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,679
processes such in there whereas jenkins

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,720
x tries to take it to the standpoint of

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
being able

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
to deploy your app and run it into

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,080
kubernetes environments

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,360
so for example if you have a has a

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,080
promotion model

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,760
i can have my app i can create it and it

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
has quick starts and stuff that i can

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
bring

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,440
import in and it will create a docker

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
container for you if you don't have one

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
wrap your app in a container it will

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,159
create the helm charts to deploy into

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,720
kubernetes

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,720
it will create a name in kubernetes and

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
deploy your app out there and run

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,320
it will allow you to uh connect up

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
through um the visual studio ide stuff

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,280
out there and be able to debug into

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it so jenkins x is really about getting

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
your app

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,799
into that containerized kubernetes

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
environment and running it out there

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,000
it does build a pipeline but it really

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,200
relies on

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
the pipeline stuff isn't as unique or

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,679
quite as interesting other than it's

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,039
using tekton now which is getting closer

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,919
to uh the kubernetes kind of primitives

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,679
it's basically

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
pipelines expressed kind of as

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,480
kubernetes objects out there

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,640
so you get some efficiency from that but

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,440
it's the pipeline part isn't as much the

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,039
cool part of jenkins x as it is about

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,679
wrapping your up you're wrapping your

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,919
app up as the container

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,159
and getting it out there running in a

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,520
pod and clustering kubernetes

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,080
and doing that so you can just be

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,840
deploying on the clouds

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,520
that makes sense and just as an update

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,280
for everyone it looks like the

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,880
the forum is unfortunately no longer

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,000
accepting submissions so i guess they

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,440
gave away all the books that

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
they had so i guess so sorry about that

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
folks

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,200
uh i would suggest you know again i mean

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
the books you can sometimes

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,799
amazon seems to vary the price it seems

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,919
to run on them there

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,080
the electronic ones are cheaper in there

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
if you do get a book and if you see me

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
sometime in a conference or something

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,039
i'm happy to

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,440
to sign it for you once we get back to

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,600
a place where we can all interact

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
face-to-face again

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,919
absolutely and just uh there are

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,360
questions about titles so there's a book

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,960
jenkins two up and running and then

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
there's another book called professional

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,039
git

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,240
yep professional get uh as opposed to

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,640
pro git now pro

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,799
pro git is a good book too by a guy

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,600
named guy named scott chacon

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,320
out there uh i you know i'm not going to

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
tell you

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,679
my book is the only one out there the

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
best one or whatever it's out there i

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,760
think it's a good book i'm biased but

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
uh you know there's other resources out

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,960
there as well

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,080
um and as well if you're interested you

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
know if you like the way the

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,360
professional get book is written stuff i

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,240
do do some classes

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,159
on o'reilly and stuff periodically that

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,400
might be interested in joining in

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,640
and i sometimes do one at all things

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,640
open or open source 101

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,279
called uh an advanced git and we go into

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,720
actually some advanced features and

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,320
tools that most people haven't heard

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,159
about that work with git

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,520
uh bisect and one called uh

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,960
rethree or reuse recorded resolution

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,640
different ones out there

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,120
that might be of interest so look for

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,120
that periodically and we'll

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,600
hopefully do that again sometime folks

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,000
at all things open open source 101 todd

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,120
danny those guys are fantastic

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
uh and hoping maybe at some point we can

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
do

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
uh another some more get stuff out there

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
as well

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,520
that's awesome and this is also a chance

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,400
for me to plug my book amateur git

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,000
um which is basically about uh just

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,240
getting incredibly frustrated and

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
crafting terrible pull requests

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,640
which was the first few months of me

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,120
using a github no i'm just kidding

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
um so sounds like it could be a book

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
though

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,840
real life experience is using get and uh

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
yeah

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,919
i don't think i would sell it quite as

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,880
well as yours uh i did see a note

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,559
from matthew asking uh about the forum

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,400
so yeah we were sharing the forum every

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,240
few minutes since the beginning of the

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
of the presentation so i guess they just

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,360
reached the end of uh

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,360
of the books that they were sending out

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,760
recently so i apologize for that

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,520
um we still do have about 10 minutes

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,039
left so if anybody has any questions

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,159
feel free to ask them

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,120
either in the chat or in the in the q a

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,000
below

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,880
um i mean writing two books is a pretty

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,880
big

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,799
pretty big lift especially moving

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
between different publishers right

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,559
learning two different processes

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,919
yeah you know it's interesting um i i

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,279
kind of did the first book i did

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,960
professional getting like i said both of

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,840
these were written kind of on weekends

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,080
and evenings

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,919
and there so thankfully my family you

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,679
know was supportive and stuff

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
sorry i'm getting the sun stripes here

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,760
as i look and move around

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,600
the weirdest looking sunburn i know

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,440
yeah kind of it's gonna look like we

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,520
really grilled you

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,640
kind of shy bounces off my head anyway

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
but there you go

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,120
uh but you're interesting what i was

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,240
going to say is even with the

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,919
the writing process wasn't as

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,279
ah geez i don't want to use it sound

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,600
negative too negative here

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,600
wasn't as uh challenging perhaps as the

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,919
editing process

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,120
you don't think about it as much but the

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
editors that

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,159
you know have the job of okay you said

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,360
it here

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,200
what did you mean by it and no you can't

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
use the first person here you have to

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,480
use

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,679
second person or third person okay and

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
well this isn't clear

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,440
what does that mean and the editors i

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,559
could not do that job i mean that is

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,200
they they are you know

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,080
reading through lord knows you know

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
bunches of

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,399
stale sort of dry material about

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,320
all these things they could probably

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,159
care less about don't

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,159
don't oversell your book now brent

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,720
it is what it is you can read the

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,840
reviews out there the gift review is

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
pretty good

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,600
the jenkins xbox people complain about

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
the snapshot or the screenshots

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,440
no i just mean as an editor you're not

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,640
interested in material probably but

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,600
you're going through and having to edit

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,360
it in there too

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,360
but the editing process seemed to take

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,720
forever and that's the hardest challenge

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,799
i had with that

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
um you know i've written a few articles

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,399
as well

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
if you look out on o'reilly and

00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:16,399
opensource.com and search for my name

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
you'll find articles on various topics

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,120
uh

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,600
jenkins garrett get cicd

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,360
there's a nice sea ice cream between ci

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,559
c between continuous integration

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,679
continuous delivery and continuous

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,559
deployment

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,760
out on uh o'reilly site some stuff on

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
open source anyway

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,799
point being those are fairly easy to

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
write

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,159
and you know do diagrams and stuff for

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,279
but it's

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,720
challenging to um do the editing that

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,679
seems to take a long time

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
and uh takes a lot of effort in there

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,320
well actually we have a

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,399
we have a question on that topic i i

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,720
just do want to reach out to

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
uh matthew uh in the chat again you know

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,840
if if you do want to

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,000
um ask for a copy of the book i would

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,919
reach out to the organizers

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,039
the conference organizers and see if you

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,640
could um

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,039
see if you could email them and get you

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,360
know an exception or something

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,240
but john is actually has a question

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
about the

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,120
book writing process how yeah

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
how long does it normally take for a

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,520
publisher once accepted to actually get

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,799
the book printed and out for sale

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,120
uh if you're talking about from the

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,480
final draft to

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,520
getting it available i would say

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,679
probably at least three months uh

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,279
from the from there i know if they told

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
me if i had gotten the

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,399
jenkins x book i think in september it

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
would have been out by the end of the

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,120
year

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,279
so probably something on the order of

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,799
three months to get it printed and out

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,159
for sale overall i generally you know

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,480
i think it's taken me about a year to

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,320
write each one which you know in in

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,600
technology terms is forever

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,360
and that's one of the challenges of

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,960
writing one of these books is

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
you got to keep up with the technology i

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,000
mean i'm i'm doing you know googling to

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,080
find

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
information of what's new and hopefully

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,880
if you can get in with somebody like on

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,200
the jenkins side

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,880
which i was fortunate to do in jenkins 2

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
not as much in genghis x to find people

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,720
who were inside who explained to me

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,399
this is what's coming this is what we're

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,600
doing that sort of thing

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,720
that makes a lot of difference as well

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,320
uh crystal i can read crystal's

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,919
question here so crystal says i work for

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,279
a non-profit that teaches free

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,679
programming classes

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,440
also to be on rails and react i'm a

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,240
graduate of their classes and now i'm a

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,760
mentor

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,320
what would be a good way to introduce

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
students to containers as code newbies

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
that's

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,559
that's uh quite a question any feedback

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
on that

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,960
um you know crystal i i really i mean

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,320
again

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,120
i am biased in this but there is

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,640
uh there are some things on o'reilly if

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,559
you have an o'reilly subscription

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,480
and stuff that are containers and such

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,159
it with training and such in there that

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,000
i do and talk about that

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
uh if you would like for the non-profit

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,240
crystal i am happy to

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
you know come some time or do a virtual

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,960
presentation maybe

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
of one of those classes in there uh

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
if we when we could probably do

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,320
something that would simplify what i do

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,440
and i do uh cut like a six hour class

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
for o'reilly we wouldn't have to do

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,480
something like that

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,919
but if you're interested contact me you

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,960
can uh through

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,440
linkedin or twitter or something direct

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
message

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,640
and we could i can set up something with

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
that and maybe we could talk about it

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
and

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,279
happy to help always happy to help

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,720
people learn more about it especially

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,559
nonprofit thank you for doing that

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,640
that's awesome yeah thank you thank you

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,320
for that generous offer

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,080
i'm always interested in the approach to

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,919
teaching people about containers because

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,840
when when i was first doing software

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,159
development there were no containers

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,039
right so a lot of the abstractions that

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,080
i know

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,559
you know containers are kind of uh an

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,840
annoying intermediary to getting uh

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,080
things to production

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,360
but at the same time for people who are

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,720
you know coming into the software

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
industry now containers

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,760
i mean it's just like a de facto part of

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,720
life

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,399
and my first instinct was to say like oh

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
don't talk too much about containers it

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,320
might

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,039
you know confuse them but i think uh i

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,120
think maybe

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,039
that's just me projecting you know

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,200
people doing cloud native development

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
in the next few years maybe yeah just be

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
second nature

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,919
i think it will be you know i've seen

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,919
that in my own and at

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,519
sas where i work is people have kind of

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,279
gotten used to you know what uh

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,080
wasn't long ago kubernetes and stuff

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,919
were just these funny words and such and

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,039
now it's almost like second nature i

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,679
think it's like anything right

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
a new operating system or a new

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,399
technology programming language or

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,960
something eventually

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,480
you have to kind of get a hand you get a

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
handle on and get a feel for it

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,679
you know one of the tenants i kind of

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,960
have with with teaching

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,480
things is i like to do animations like

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,880
to use analogies to help people

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,200
understand things and these hands-on

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,720
labs where you can actually

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,480
try some things out i try to make it

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
very sort of handheld because i believe

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,000
honestly people teach themselves a lot

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
you know you can listen to somebody

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,919
rattle on me or somebody else about

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
containers kubernetes stuff but it's

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,360
when you actually get to well for me at

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,000
least when you get to actually practice

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,320
it

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,559
and try it out and kind of relate it to

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,399
things that you know about

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
that's kind of when the learning happens

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,519
i think in there

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,279
i'm still old school i don't trust any

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,279
storage media that you can't bend

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,799
i've still got a bunch of uh floppy

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
somewhere i think

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,159
five and a quarters or something there

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,360
somewhere there you go

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,519
yeah i've got some somewhere yeah we've

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,519
got a follow-up here from blacksmith who

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,360
says thank you for clarifying on how

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
wonderful jenkins x is

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,039
are there any constraints uh are we

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,919
looking for

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,880
a specific prerequisites uh like we

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,640
should be using

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,159
terraform that's a great question

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,240
lakshmi uh so and

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,159
in terms of how wonderful i would say

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,159
you know wonderful i guess depending on

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,039
if it works for you or not it's a very

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,880
it's a complex

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,200
project and i don't want to i don't want

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
to paint just a utopia here because it's

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,320
still

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,320
there are so many moving parts in terms

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,240
of how it works and stuff in there

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,919
it can still be a little challenging in

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,440
there that's why i was trying to

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,839
to write the book about it to help

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
clarify with that but when it works it

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,079
is very nice

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,760
to go from simple commands out to having

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,720
things deployed in the clouds

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,720
any constraints on it uh yeah i mean

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,240
even now they're revamping it to do a

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,760
version three of it which is why the

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,359
books kind of on hold

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
with that and they used to have

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,879
functionality for example

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,320
in jenkins x a command that would let

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,839
you create a cluster

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,599
uh spin up a cluster for you

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,839
automatically on google or

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,720
on you know any of the cloud providers

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,720
out there

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,000
but what they've done now they said yeah

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,240
that's not really the right way

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,720
to do it we really should be having

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,720
people use other things like terraform

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,399
so now they're pushing more for people

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
to use terraform

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,839
to create the cluster and then you

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,240
actually install

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,280
jenkins x running in the cluster and do

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
your work there

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
so they've kind of gradually moving

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,079
moving away from this thing of having

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,760
jenkins x

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,839
you know be the answer to everything and

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
try to do it all to say no

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,200
you should use more standard tools like

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,000
terraform out there

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,040
so there are some constraints around or

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,040
i'd say some

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,200
changes to how they do things where

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,200
they're allowing more other tools to do

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,359
it

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,800
that's awesome i see uh we have a

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,359
question

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,520
from peter what about eight inch or

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,920
cassette drives yes

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,839
those are peter you're very intuitive

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,359
those are the recommended media

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,359
for continuous integration and

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,560
yeah everyone out there who is using

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,800
solid state drives

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,040
and random access memory you're missing

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,839
out on a really fun time

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,640
deploying software from a cassette drive

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,359
one of my first jobs in college was as a

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,200
operator at a bank at night and we used

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,800
to have the eight inch drives and stuff

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,480
i used to have to go and you know run

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,599
their computers run their backups and

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,320
stuff and

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,079
all that so sorry laughing back into the

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,280
wayback machine here but

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,640
so crystal has a follow-up and a

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,400
relative relating to the non-profit yeah

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,680
saying we have people using their own

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,599
computers and spend a lot of time

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
troubleshooting for different systems

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,480
for some projects it could be nice to

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,560
use a container so they could focus on

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,640
the app code rather than getting stuck

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,160
on setup i mean that's a that's a really

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,359
great point yeah you know

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,599
yeah personally i work for

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,119
ibm and we do a lot of labs with

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,640
students and as soon as you start

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,599
working with somebody's local

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
environment

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,320
you run into all sorts of issues with

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,920
paths and versions and stuff like that

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,359
so that i i really like that idea

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
because you're kind of leveraging the

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,839
universality

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,760
of containers to help with education

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,960
absolutely and what i do and pretty much

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,480
all and by the way i used to work for

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,839
ibm back in the early

00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,079
90s long time ago but

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,680
what i do with all my classes and labs

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,000
is typically i'll

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,760
have a virtual machine which runs on a

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,320
program called virtualbox

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,079
out there and the virtual machine has

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,839
everything configured and everything set

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,280
up for it because there's no way

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,520
in the time we have to get everything

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,280
set up for people now virtualbox has its

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,000
own challenges out there

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,760
you know and they're large images but

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,160
it's actually worked out pretty well we

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,400
had uh the workshop today

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,680
uh and i think we had a hundred people

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,839
still by the end of this

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,119
class or so um but you know you're

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,079
running technical things but we've kind

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,560
of figured out how to get around them

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,040
but that's

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,320
but i don't i don't ever try to get

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,920
everything set up on everybody's

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
computer unless it's git

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,920
if it's just a git class that's pretty

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,760
easy too but anything with kubernetes i

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
use a virtual machine that has mini cube

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
running

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,640
and things like istio installed or

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,520
docker all those different things

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
automatically

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,839
so yeah i agree that's awesome we just

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,200
have a few more minutes so if you have

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,800
any other questions

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,560
feel free to stick them in q a feel free

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,200
to stick them in the chat

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,200
we do have one from john john playing

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,400
around he references a particular

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,240
version number but

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
he says when you talk about jenkins 2 as

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,040
in your book are you referring to the

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,599
open source jenkins

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,640
that is out and currently at lts version

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,640
2.249.1

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
john it's not going to be at that latest

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,480
version because the jenkins 2

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,599
book came out a couple of years back in

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,440
there although i

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,960
do believe that most things should still

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
apply when i do the

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,920
i do a couple of classes on a ride like

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,119
building a deployment pipeline with

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,720
jenkins 2 and such

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,880
and i usually update it for there so it

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,880
should be as far as i know everything

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,720
still works with it uh the only thing is

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,440
typically to change or they add a

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,480
feature here there in the ui and such in

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
there so

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,839
yes it should be that v2 but it probably

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,599
won't be 249

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,040
it won't be the long term support

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,560
version there

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,480
uh for the it's not written specifically

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,880
for that one the version it's written

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
for

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
is probably uh you know your older or so

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,079
anyway

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,720
so yeah it should most of it should

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,720
still work though

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,160
awesome sounds good um i see that um

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,680
matthew was asking um you can create

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,200
with web dev you can create a project

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,200
for personal use

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,000
uh but it's hard to wrap my head around

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,720
it uh around all these different items

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
what tasks can i set forth on so i guess

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,560
how

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,320
like what's a good way to get an

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,599
introduction to this uh

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
this whole context this whole

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,520
environment um

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
if you're talking about you know

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,160
containers or stuff like that

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,640
i recommend uh conferences like this of

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,960
course if the the workshops and stuff

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,920
really that i i'm a big believer in the

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,119
hands-on

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,720
kind of workshops and stuff not just the

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,480
lecture portion

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
and that's why i really try to do things

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,760
with the vms

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,520
uh and i give that to people and say

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,440
here's your environment they have that

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
then one of the last things i try to

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,560
remember to tell people i think i forgot

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,720
at this time but in the workshop

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,400
you know is okay now you've got the vm

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,800
you've got the lab documents

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,520
go off and try and play with it work

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,560
with it

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,240
you know really when you get into this

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,839
like with learning anything i find that

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,400
the hands-on stuff

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,079
try something that's not in the labs try

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
changing something you know you can

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,960
always

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,400
uh go back usually there's you ways to

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,560
go back in this

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,079
see how it works out there and honestly

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,520
i'll tell you if you really want to

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,960
learn something

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,440
uh promise to teach it to somebody

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,960
it sounds uh but if you have to teach it

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,560
to somebody if you're in charge of

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,920
teaching it somebody or helping somebody

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,119
with it at your work

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,960
you're probably going to learn it pretty

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,720
well but i would say you know

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,000
get one of these virtual environments or

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
something uh there's another one out

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,640
there

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,319
catacotas k-a-t-a-c-o-d-a

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
if you haven't looked at catacota look

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,839
at catacota

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
you can find things i think o'reilly

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,520
just bought them but

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,319
catacota is an environment and you can

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,880
spin up

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,839
things really quickly uh crystal if you

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,960
haven't looked at that for your

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,680
non-profit

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,599
uh maybe look at that as well a catacota

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,560
is a great little environment to try

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,000
things out with

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,000
if you search for it you'll find all

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,480
kinds of uh

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,839
links to it and stuff to try things out

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,920
so

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,680
yeah but definitely you know it's if

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
you're just kind of following along you

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,520
can kind of get it

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,520
hands-on is better but if you try things

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,480
out try changing things and seeing oh

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,480
what does that do

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,079
kind of thing that'll help you learn it

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
and also like i said if you ever want to

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,800
you know just try to

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,040
mentor somebody or teach somebody with

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,839
it that'll force you to learn it as well

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,960
but check out the catacota environments

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,880
uh

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:42,079
and interactive those are great to try

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:42,079
