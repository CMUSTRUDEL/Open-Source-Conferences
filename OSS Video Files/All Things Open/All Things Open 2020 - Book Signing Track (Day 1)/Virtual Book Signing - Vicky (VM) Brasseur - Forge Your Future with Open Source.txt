specifically about my book forge your

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,520
future uh with open source which i will

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,119
drop actually so mine says i'm sending

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,840
just to the panelists let me

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
send a chat and attendees yeah

00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,119
fosforge.com um you can find the book

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
there

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,400
at fosforge.com um it's the first and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
only book about how to contribute to

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
open source software we didn't have a

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,079
book all about this before now

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880
um and my brilliance and magnificent

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
editor is

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,680
also sitting here in the chat so

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,119
um i will probably uh defer to him on

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,240
specific things if need be

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
um so david i might poke you at some

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,960
point

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
to um to get uh brian mcdonald unmuted

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
if needed

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
but he's not going to want to talk

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
so what if there are people that want to

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
write books

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,360
in the attending i think

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
brian would be a great person to answer

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
that question i also can speak to my

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
personal experiences writing

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,880
uh books and working with the publisher

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
um and working with brian

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
but i liked brian before i wrote a book

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,720
and i still like him

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,440
so that's how well the pro the entire

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,879
writing process went

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,239
i'm just going to sit here and embarrass

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
brian the whole time so i don't have to

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
embarrass myself instead oh

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
i like the circle of embarrassment we

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
have going on here this is really good

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,480
i i wish i knew more about our other

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,640
moderator but

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,239
just uh just a quick logistical thing i

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
noticed that somebody did put their hand

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
up in the list of attendees

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
if you do have a question feel free to

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,840
stick it into the chat

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,120
or there's a q a section also i think

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
uh deb and vm would be happy wherever

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
you put the question

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,560
yeah um so if you have any questions

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
about what it's like to contribute to

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
open source or how to get started

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,400
um or what it was like to write the book

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,640
or you know

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
um let me see you can't sign up for the

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120
ebook giveaway

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
with a non-us number so i can answer

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
that one um

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,560
somebody somebody gave a suggestion in

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
the last

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
uh session which is the rejection

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,440
hotline number

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
and so if you if you have an

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840

number you're welcome

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,159
there's also the uh rick astley hotline

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,840
[Laughter]

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
wait vicki are you gonna put that in the

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
chat or are you like never gonna give it

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
up

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,400
i'm never gonna give it i you know i i

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
was

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
going to do that but i i have to find it

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
now because i'm never going to let you

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,239
down

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,280
thank you that's the other end of that

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
joke i was hoping for

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,799
so i i can only i can type or i can talk

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,040
i can do both which is why

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
deb very kindly offered to help me

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,640
because i can't really uh pay attention

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,720
to what y'all are saying in the chat if

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
i'm answering questions which means i

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,200
need some questions so bring it on folks

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
actually uh so the rick astley hotline

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,400
for those who don't know is an

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
entire open source project and

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,200
there's a link to it in the chat if you

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
would like it it has uh numbers

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
for australia new zealand uk and the usa

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
which should probably get you covered if

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,840
you need a number

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,840
to enter the book giveaway

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
so vicky can you talk a little bit about

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
like who

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
um who you think the audience is for the

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
book maybe that'll help people kind of

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,280
sharpen their question zone

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,720
so it was really important to me when i

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
was writing the book that it

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,720
not be programmer specific so

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,960
um it is it's applicable to anyone who

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,440
does anything in open source projects if

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,759
you're

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,440
a writer or infosec or project manager

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
or community manager or

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,919
programmer just anything having to do

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
with an open source project because in

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,720
order to have

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
any successful software project be it

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
open source or otherwise you need lots

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
of people performing lots of different

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
roles

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
so the book does not speak specifically

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
to

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
well here's the nitty gritty about how

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,440
to use git because a lot of people don't

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
need to know that and there's adequate

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
information about that already right

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
um so you don't need me to explain that

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
you do need me to explain you

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
to you how to find a project um you know

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,479
how to set your own goals for finding a

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,919
project what what's right for you um

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,919
all those unwritten social rules around

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,600
contributing to open source like why

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
people get their knickers in a twist

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
about spaces versus tabs things like

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
that

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
the stuff nobody tells you about until

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
you step across that line and make what

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
they see as a mistake

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
and then they get really mean to you so

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
um the book is for anyone who wants to

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,720
contribute to open source projects

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,080
and uh it is it was really interesting

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
writing it because every single open

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
source project has a different

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
contribution process right um you do it

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,280
this way for openstack you do it

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
that way for debian right it's it's

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
completely different for every project

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,319
big small

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,240
everything like that but there are some

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
just some fundamental

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
uh tenants that are apply across all of

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,759
them

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,520
um and it's actually been really

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
interesting to see how people have used

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,199
the book

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,479
not for open source um a friend of mine

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,919
uh mark prather

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,440
he does uh software management so he's a

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
dev manager he also does project

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
management and scrum master and all that

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
sort of

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
you know good organizational people

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,120
stuff um he says that he recommends this

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
book for all the remote teams that he

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
works with because he finds it's the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
best manual

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,479
on how to coordinate diverse

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
and um distributed teams which is

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
obviously something that

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
you know we in open source we've got a

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
leg up on most the rest of the world

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,680
because now everybody's remote and we've

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,039
done this before right i mean we've

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
worked with people on the other side of

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
the world

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
without having to leave the comfort of

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
our own homes or our own

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,639
you know cafe not that we go to cafes

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
anymore

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
but um so it's been really interesting

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,240
seeing how people apply it in

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
other in other ways

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,759
neat oh that's super cool um we were on

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
one of the um

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,880
community leadership summit

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
conversations talking about

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,160
uh non-coders and how projects

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
need to have folks that can do different

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,280
stuff because otherwise you

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
you know it people aren't very happy

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
when they're doing the things that

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,960
they're not very good at and stuff

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
like that so yeah i mean not only are

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,639
they not happy but it's just

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,160
you're gonna burn people out right if

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,360
you're expecting

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,240
the people to both code and

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,599
do user interface and do accessibility

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,800
and do technical writing

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
and do infrastructure and do you know

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
release management

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
you can't expect one small group of

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
people to do all of those things and do

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,479
it well

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
something's going to fall you're you're

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,280
you're juggling right you're juggling a

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,599
lot of balls

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,680
and something's going to fall at that

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,759
point you have to figure out

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
how to continue juggling without

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
dropping the balls that are for instance

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
made out of glass

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
some of them are more important than

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,400
others so

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
why don't you just stop juggling and

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
hand everybody a ball

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
uh and then you're less likely to get

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
tired of juggling and to drop those

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,639
glass balls

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,440
so and some people frankly aren't good

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
at juggling

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
some people are good at i used to

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,280
program

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,800
it's not something i recommend anyone

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
ask me to do now

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,680
i lead software engineering departments

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
um at like the vp level i do corporate

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,200
strategy

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,800
i will understand what everyone's doing

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
for programming

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,160
but man there are people who are so much

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
better at that than i am

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
so work to your strengths and if you are

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
working to something that's not your

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
strength like you're being forced to

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
write and you've never

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
really had the opportunity or taken the

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,320
opportunity to write

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
then you're not going to create good

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
documentation and you're going to be all

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
frustrated

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,959
so give that to somebody who's better at

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
it then your users are happy and you're

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
happy and your tech writers are happy

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,120
and i know

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
everyone's happy why don't you bring on

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
more people to do this so that's

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,640
what the book tries to help you do is

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
you know

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
how can you get involved to do that and

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
make everyone happy and it's

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,600
one of the biggest steps i think towards

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,519
uh open source sustainability

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
which is what your talk your panel was

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,800
about earlier um

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,760
yeah right yeah for about that long

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,720
before

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,160
the entire online conferencing thing

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
just got too frustrating to me and then

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,760
i went to work on my slides instead for

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,399
my talk tomorrow um so uh

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
what's your talk on tomorrow tomorrow my

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,880
talk is the basics of copyright and

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
licensing for software developers

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
excellent and it is based on some of the

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
content that's in the book

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,600
uh that's expanded a bit more i'm gonna

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,399
try and keep it down to like

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
35 or 40 minutes in the 45 minute slot

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,079
so i have some time for a q a

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
but there's a lot to cover there even

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,560
with just the basics

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,240
um would you recommend your book to

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,399
lawyers that are working in the open

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,760
source space for the first time

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,160
oh heck yes um lawyers and

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
business people i work in the business

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
space right corporate strategy so

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,040
um recommend it to them recommend it to

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,240
uh

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,600
students teachers and project

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
maintainers

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,079
um so each of these groups can get

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
something different out of it

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
but it all kind of comes down to

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,000
perspective

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
so what can you get uh how can you

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,959
understand the people on the other side

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,680
of the equation

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
if you're a business person trying to

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
use

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,480
or contribute to or release open source

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
software you probably don't understand

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
open source that's what i find with the

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,040
vast majority of the companies i work

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,600
with they just

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,360
they mean well but they don't understand

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,120
and i have another talk that's

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
uh you know entering the open source

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,000
emerging market where

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
you're going somewhere where there's a

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
different culture there's a different

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
language

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
and if you don't take the time to

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,800
understand that you're going to fall

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
flat on your face and you're going to

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,839
screw up and then

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
everybody's going to be angry you don't

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,480
want that so to minimize the anger

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
learn more about that space that you're

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
entering into and learning how to

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
contribute

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,959
is a really good way to walk a mile in

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
someone else's shoes

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,800
so that's really good um for project

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
maintainers if you read the book you can

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,200
get a better sense of what

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
a contributor might be looking for so

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,800
how can you make your project

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,320
uh more welcoming to people to to come

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,680
and contribute to your project

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,760
so you can kind of you can

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,959
allow more people to help and if more

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,480
people are helping that means you have

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,560
to do less which means you don't have to

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,639
get woken up at like 3 a.m

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
when the site falls over you've got

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,040
someone else on the other side of the

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
world who can do that in the middle of

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
the day

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
right you don't have to get burned out

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
doing everything on your project you can

00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
make it

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
a more welcoming space so more people

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
will come and contribute

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
and then you don't get burned up um and

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
you know it's really a much more

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,639
sustainable way to have an open source

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
ecosystem

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
what's like a small example of something

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,079
that you think

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,240
people like they maybe weren't doing it

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,920
on purpose but it wasn't very welcoming

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
and then when you say it in the book

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,200
it's like ah

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,680
aha oh god uh

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,639
i i i'm really bad at exact examples

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,120
unless i've had a

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
chance to uh think it through in advance

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,399
um

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,399
and i would probably end up naming and

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,399
shaming and i don't like doing that

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
cool we won't do that because ladies on

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,760
the internet don't need any of that

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,920
so um cool uh let's go back

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
uh we'll zoom back out again uh pun

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,000
intended

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
i don't know um

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,399
um so uh can you

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,000
what do you think is one of the like

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
what do you think is like different

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
about the

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
open source sector than like other

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,279
sectors so if people were coming from

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
another

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,040
work sector like what do you think is

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
like kind of the biggest thing

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
that is hard to get your head around

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,360
when you come here to open source

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,160
um so when i work with companies around

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,839
open source

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,320
uh the one thing they have a really hard

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,839
time with is relinquishing control

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
and allowing and playing well with

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,959
others uh they're used to keeping

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,160
everything within their four walls

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,160
so to speak um you know so you don't

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,920
share information outside you don't

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
speak with others you don't solicit

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
feedback

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
outside of your little bubble except in

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,079
very

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,680
uh very discreet ways such as you get

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,760
your marketing team to go out and do

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,680
some market research and stuff like that

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,920
but you aren't really putting it all out

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
there um and that makes a lot of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
companies

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,040
very very afraid um they're afraid that

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
they will get raped over the calls that

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,720
they will get

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
mocked that they will potentially

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
release

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
something they should not um

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,360
intellectual property

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
that they might release something that's

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,639
insecure

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
that the quality of their code or their

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,360
project will be lacking

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
um and what i find is that almost all of

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
this

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,639
is um it's based in historical things

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,519
that we have done

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
as free and open source software people

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
and

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
as just an industry right um we can lay

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,600
a lot of this unfortunately at the feet

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,920
of microsoft back in the

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,720
you know 90s and early 2000s um they

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
have done

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
a 180 degree turn and they they now

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,040
understand

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,880
and they get it um and they're shifting

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
in a really authentic way so yay

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,560
microsoft i'm

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,839
legitimately thrilled with the direction

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
they are taking free and open source

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
software now

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,079
um so there's that but there's also we

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,320
in and free software and open source

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
we have done a really good job of

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,880
driving people away

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,000
by being frankly um and we are

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
real jerks about

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,199
anyone who steps across these invisible

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
lines

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,880
that we can see but no one else can and

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
then we treat them like crap

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,199
and so companies are afraid of that and

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
they're afraid of getting mocked and

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,560
and um they're afraid of getting you

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
know

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,320
put on hacker news for something they

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,079
accidentally misstepped and

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,040
suddenly they've got a pr nightmare um

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,120
rather than was it um was it slashdot

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,440
that had the image of the borg

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,360
as for every single microsoft story for

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
like 15 years or something

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
yeah exactly they just never let up i

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,440
mean you know

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
like though microsoft may have deserved

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
a lot of that but like

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,959
yeah it it didn't exactly say like

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
you're welcome here

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
exactly we're we weren't welcoming and

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,959
we aren't um

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,560
we in software we're really big on

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,920
blameless post-mortems now right

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
something goes wrong you don't point

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
fingers

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
you try and figure out what went wrong

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,240
and you fixed it um because it's

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
typically not

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
human error if there's one error that

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,480
can happen caused by a human

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,839
that's not the human's fault it's the

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
system's fault and so you have to fix

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,519
the system

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,320
not blame the human so we do that in our

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,800
software

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,560
but we don't do that in our culture and

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,920
so what we have are a lot of people

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,519
making mistakes because we've done a

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,880
very bad job of

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,480
of educating them and helping to reach

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
out to them and understand their

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,240
perspective and getting them to

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
understand

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
ours right doing that translation layer

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
we don't do that well

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,360
and so it drives a lot of people away

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,440
both um

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
both individual contributors and also

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
companies uh

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,440
companies also therefore you know they

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
end up not knowing how to do these

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,399
things

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,320
so if they want to do it because it's

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,880
trendy and it's popular and

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,560
sorry folks it is trendy and popular to

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
be participating in open source right

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
now

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
they want to be there and if we're not

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
showing them how to do it

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,680
i'm sorry they're just going to make

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,399
this up as they want right and

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,120
they're going to

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,800
try and figure it out as best they can

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,040
and if we're not there to help them

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
and provide guidance then yeah they're

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
going to make missteps

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
but that frankly is our fault for

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
setting up a system where they can make

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
the mistakes so we can do a lot better

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,319
at that

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,000
there are other things that they can do

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
internally that they should be doing

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
just

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,799
as for like clean code um you know

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
always be looking at your your code to

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,360
make sure you're not

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,679
committing your aws credentials you know

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,880
always be looking at your stack to make

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
sure you're not using

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,039
out of date open source components

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
otherwise you know you're just

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
one bad day away from being the next

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
equifax

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
right always be looking at no one watch

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
that those are just

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
standard things that you should be doing

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,240
anyway as a business but i find most

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
companies aren't they don't even know

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,799
what their entire open source

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,320
uh supply chain is let alone

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,000
you know which pieces of that chain

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,559
which links that chain are weak

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
we can do a whole lot better there as an

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,520
industry and as

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
open source we have a question i'm so

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,840
excited

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
is it do folks have questions for vicki

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,919
there's one in the q a

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,520
uh as a new salesforce programmer would

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,280
this book help me navigate how to

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,320
contribute and create projects

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,039
in open source tanisha excellent

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
question

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,559
um so this will have nothing to do with

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,400
salesforce specifically

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,400
um you do have an open source program

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
office in salesforce and i encourage you

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
to seek them up

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
and they'll be able to help you um but

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
as far as

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,360
contributing to open source yes this

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,880
book is specifically about that so it'll

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,000
absolutely help with that

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,120
so um so i encourage you to check

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
it out but i also encourage you

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
to check your employment agreement and

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
speak with your open source program

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
office

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
because if you are intending to

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,880
contribute to open source projects

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
and you are uh doing it with or for

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,480
salesforce

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,799
um you should make sure that you are not

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
uh you're not accidentally contributing

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,520
something that your

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,360
your employer has copyright over

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
um and this is something that i cover in

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,919
my talk tomorrow

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,280
which is i know like 2 30

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,160
eastern time um and it's a

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,240
uh it's a basic introduction to

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,880
copyright and licensing

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
which is very fundamental uh it's it is

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,600
the

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,679
thing that underlies and makes open

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
source so successful without it

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,960
you know we can't really if you don't

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
understand that you can't do open source

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
very well

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
um but yeah the book will generally help

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,120
you how to

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,400
learn how to contribute to projects

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
would also help you

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,559
select a project um which is something

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
that i get a lot of questions about how

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
do i even find a project

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,200
well there are millions literally

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
millions of projects out there so

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
there's lots of good stuff where you can

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,039
contribute and lots of

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
projects that will need your help so uh

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,919
there's an entire chapter

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
just on how to find the right project

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
for you because if you just pick the

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,160
first one that comes along because

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,360
it's really popular say linux

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,880
which is the one everyone wants to

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
contribute to because everyone knows it

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,160
right

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,440
top of mind um it's really hard to

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
contribute to linux

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,720
so i don't recommend you start there

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,520
that's that's you know

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
like starting a video game on the

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
ultimate

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,280
hard mode and going directly to the end

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
boss

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,000
that's what it's like to start

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,000
contributing if you're just going

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
directly to linux

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
so i recommend you not do that find

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,600
something smaller and

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,320
more approachable and most importantly

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,720
something that's

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,760
of interest to you that you already know

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
something about

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,120
i don't know what your hobbies are

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,400
tanisha but it could be um

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,520
i i knit i i sew

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,240
i do um a lot of fermentation

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,919
stuff um so i've got a lot of other

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,320
hobbies but there are projects for

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
all of this for instance there's

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,559
freesewing.org which is a free software

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
project

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,960
where you can go to there and enter your

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,080
measurements and it will spit out

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
a pattern specifically for your size and

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,559
your measurements um

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,720
and it's great and it's all free

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,679
software so i can go and i can

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,520
contribute to that

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,000
and i already know the domain i know

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
about say seam allowances and i know

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
about grain

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,400
lines and different things like that so

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
i can read the code and it makes a lot

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
more sense to me because i already

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
understand the language

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
so it's i would be more successful

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,679
contributing to freesewing.org

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,840
than i would on something for instance

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,240
for

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,520
automotive or let's say

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,320
another one i'm looking into is uh home

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
automation

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
i don't know anything about that yet

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,039
there's a lot of things that you need to

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,360
know about hvac and

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,520
electricity and lights and stuff that i

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,880
don't know that yet so um

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,320
a lot of impedance yeah

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,080
sorry no you're not i'm not

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,640
this is why i have deb here because she

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,960
helps make everything better

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
do you think vicky that picking

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,440
something that's related to your hobby

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,080
instead of your work

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,080
is more likely to be okay with your

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,360
employer

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,559
for many employers yes if you're

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,600
able to find an open source project that

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,240
has absolutely nothing to do with what

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,640
they

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,679
do for a living for instance you let's

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
say you're working for

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,440
a large cloud provider

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
there's at least three from which you

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
can select

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,679
um let's say you're if you work at one

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
you shouldn't

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,039
contribute to the other without telling

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,520
your boss

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,480
exactly um you shouldn't contribute to

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
anything

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,520
without telling your boss because

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
they depending upon your employment

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
agreement they might

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
own the copyright over everything you

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,600
produce

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
if it's on their time or if it's on

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,360
their equipment

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,720
or if it's both and sometimes even

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
outside of that

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,320
so you have to check your contract you

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,400
have to check your employment agreement

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
and regardless of any that you always

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,360
have to tell them

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,640
just to make sure because if you don't

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,000
you're going to land yourself in a lot

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
of hot water from a

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,200
um a legal perspective i can guarantee

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,480
your company can afford a better lawyer

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,919
than you can

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,480
so just yet take a few minutes

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,760
and verify your contract verify your

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
employment agreement and

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,120
ask them speak to your manager and say

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,360
hi i would like to contribute to

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,400
freesewing.org

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,080
is that okay and do it in an

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,559
email and or documentation

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,400
yes always get this stuff in writing um

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,200
and once you get that in writing

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
like cc your personal email address so

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,520
you have it in a different place

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,799
because you always want to do a cya um

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,679
that's a cover your ass

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,280
cya um with anything involving we've

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
already said ass once i think we're

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
yeah yeah ass um i'll just i'll run

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
through all of them if you want but i am

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,520
trying to keep this relatively

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,360
you know pg-13 um vicky do you think

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
there's also like some

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,200
like as opposed to just lawsuit

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,200
avoidance which is its own

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,120
good do you think there's also some

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
benefits to telling your employer that

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,440
you're interested in expanding your

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
skill set

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,640
by contributing to open source see

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,559
i knew i got the right friend to help me

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,440
with this um

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,320
yes absolutely so one of the things that

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
open source

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,080
one of the many things open source can

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,679
do for you is help you move forward in

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,640
your career

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
um it you can learn new skills if you

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,520
don't know technical writing now you can

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,039
learn it there

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
you can learn how to program in a new

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
language you can learn project

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
management skills you can learn all of

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,840
these great

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,200
things and that's awesome but it's not

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,279
going to help as much

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,559
if you don't tell your your employer

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
that you're actually doing this

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
it's like hey look i'm doing this cool

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
stuff so when you're one-on-ones with

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,320
your manager

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
as you are working on your yearly goals

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
or however your

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,279
company does that you know make sure to

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,919
mention i want to contribute to open

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,440
source

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,279
here are the things i want to get out of

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,760
it that

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,559
presupposes of course you have done the

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,080
thinking

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,919
of what you want to get out of it and um

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,919
this is something that a lot of people

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,360
you know it it's

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,200
you know what do i want to get out of

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,400
contributing to open source it's like

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,880
the question is made out of

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,840
teflon people will ask it and then their

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,640
brain slides

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,960
right off right they just they they

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
don't

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,919
want to think about that because i

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,520
should be contributing to open source

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,360
because it's cool because

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
you know altruism giving back is the

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
right thing to do well it's

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
okay to get something out of it and

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
actually you're more likely to be

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,240
successful and to stick with it if you

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,159
can see the benefits of it

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
it's like if you start any sort of new

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,600
hobby if

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,200
if you start you know this is one of the

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,279
first things i knit

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,559
if you know anything about knitting um

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
it's very very simple

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,279
it's just back and forth and back and

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
forth and back and forth and back and

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,600
forth and back and forth

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,120
the exact same stitch for about seven

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,159
eight feet

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,640
um on really big needles it was really

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
easy

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
but 20 years later i'm still wearing

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
this thing

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,679
and i'm still knitting because i had

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,360
this success that i'm able to look at

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,200
right and that was really great to be

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,279
able to do that same thing with

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,520
open source or any other endeavor you

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,720
want an easy success you want an easy

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,720
win

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,559
right so try and get something that you

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,240
know you're going to be successful at

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,400
um and then you can

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,159
use that to springboard and continue

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
forward on your goals and i think i lost

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
the threat there

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,520
well i was kind of asking you because

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,320
you talked a lot about like

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,400
specific tangible skills but say you

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,360
work somewhere you don't like very much

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,559
like is meeting a bunch of folks at an

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,559
open source project

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:39,840
like good for your career network

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,840

you're keeping me uh you're covering all

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,880
this stuff i ought to be talking about

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,480
but i wouldn't if i would just left to

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
my own devices which is why

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,159
i need can i write the blurb on the back

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,039

probably yes okay brian please write

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
take a note

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,679

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,480
don't like um

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,919
take a look at your career i mean take a

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
look at the job and see why you don't

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,000
like it it could be that your manager

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
sucks

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,200
but it could be that the work sucks it

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,559
could be that you have ethical problems

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,039
with some of the stuff your company is

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,600
doing

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,120
and you need to get out um yeah you know

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,880
there are any number of reasons maybe

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,039
you need to move to a different

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,720
part of the world maybe you need to more

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,880

maybe you have a lot of crunch time you

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,159
know there's plenty of reason why you

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,640
want to leave a job

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,240

right now which by the way

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,360
we need an open source we need people to

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,559
that you know start to learn a little

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
bit about javascript

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,399
which is one of the most popular

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,840
programming languages in the world

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,240
learn a little bit about javascript and

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
then find a project that uses javascript

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,279
and then start to make little

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,440
contributions and

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,440
use things like exorcism.io

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,840
there we go um to help practice what

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,559
you're doing

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
and then you can learn uh more about not

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
only how to do it but you can

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,360
network and you meet all these people

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
all over the world

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,520
and what when those people have jobs

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,279
that they need to fill

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,360
they're going to go to the projects that

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,120
they use in their company

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,399
and if you're one of the people who

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
contribute to that project

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
you're more likely to hear about that

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
job before someone else

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,039
and they're more likely to hire you

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,399
because they know your work because

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,679
you've already been working in the open

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,640
and they can see it

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
but also they already know that you know

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,240
their stack

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,240
you already know this javascript library

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,679
that we rely on in our company

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,880
we're more likely to hire you um

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
oh i just put in your

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
said uh david said to remember the book

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,159
giveaway and i said you have a whole

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,480
talk about

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
running a healthy job hunt which is one

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,240
of your other

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,799
things that you're excellent at um

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,600
yeah that's a four-hour workshop so full

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,360
disclosure

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
that's an investment in time but it's in

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
four chunks so you don't have to sit

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,919
down

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,159
for full but if you're unemployed like

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,200
maybe you've got a little time for that

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,039
um uh so vicki like

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,640
how do you have any like specific advice

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,200
for someone who's been doing

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
open sources volunteer and how they

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
might like

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,760
start to chip into getting paid for it

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
like

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,200
how do you get over that hump like it's

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,640
one thing to be like in a one company

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
that you do tech at they're like a

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
little

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
you know i could be at another one that

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,159
doesn't you know support

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,080
morally murky stuff or whatever but uh

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,840
how do you get from like oh no one's

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,440
ever hired me to like

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,679
protect to someone who's gonna hire me

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,720
so do you mean getting hired to

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,039
specifically work

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,200
like your first course like your first

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,720
open source job

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,200
um that depends

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,159
um so as far as first open source job

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,279
you

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,279
don't necessarily

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,880
you don't necessarily get to define that

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
there ah

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,520
while open source is really really

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,399
popular and free software to open source

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,840
is used in nearly 100 of the software

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,640
that is out there today

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,039
right so it's incredibly popular and it

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,520
is

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,240
under it is you know it underpins

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,919
everything

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,279
that we do and use that involves

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,200
software your car

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,559
your toaster everything uses

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,399
free and open source software

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,080
right um but you might not get paid to

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,799
contribute to

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,240
that to these projects that depends upon

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,440
your employer whether they are willing

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,360
to do that

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
now there are ways to speak to your

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
employer just to try to get them to do

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,679
that but the first step is always

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,399
see what their initial processes and

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,519
policies

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,279
are most companies don't have written

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,080
down policies around this yet

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,600
um but some do so have a look and see

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,399
whether they have that

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,799
um and then you have to make a business

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
case

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,399
for why it is worth them investing their

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
your time

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,880
which means their money in this project

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,559
so don't just go in there saying hey

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,640
this is an open source project that we

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,200
use i think i should contribute to it

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,960
tell them why it is worth that for them

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,159
this is a business they have to they

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
need a business case for all these

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,240
things

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559
not just because it's the right thing to

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,559
do um show them how

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,320
this is going to be worth it for them

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
we're going to land these patches that

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
are critical to these

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,519
um these features we're planning to add

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,159
in the next year

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
we're going to fix these security holes

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
before they bite us in the butt

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,360
we're going to um be able to influence

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,240
the future direction of this project you

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,080
know there

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,000
it all depends on what makes sense for

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,640
your company and how

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,640
you can push the right buttons right

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
what is important to your company

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,799
strategically speaking um

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,440
figure out what that is so you can see

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,200
whether

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,880
your contribution to this project

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,960
actually fits in there

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,279
because it might not as far as you know

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,960
getting paid full time to do it

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,640
there are some projects or some

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,080
companies out there that will do it i

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,399
um used to lead a team at hewlett

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
packard enterprise that was 100

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,159
dedicated to upstream open source

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,039
development that's all the team did

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,799
was just work on projects that the

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,559
company relied on

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,320
there are teams out there like that they

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,399
are few and far between

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,360
um uh and a lot of the times you'll find

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,360
that uh

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,960
i have personally found that these are

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,840
more in

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,120
enterprise companies enterprise you know

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,000
big big companies

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,760
will dedicate a team just for that um

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,240
there are also some companies

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,799
that are called open core and this is

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
very very popular lately with those that

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,519
get vc funding

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,840
um so lots of startups are going open

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,519
core because they didn't learn from the

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,600
90s and figure out that

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,279
you know freemium the freemium business

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,679
model doesn't actually pay your bills

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,120
but aside from that they exist and what

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,360
opencore means

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,480
is we have an open source core to our

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
project

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,519
sorry for our product product is what

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,600
you sell

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,279
project is the open source thing that

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,159
you release so we have an open source

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,799
project at the core of our proprietary

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,840
pro

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,640
product and so we have these

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,600
add-ons that are value ads that people

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,760
can buy

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,519
like extra support or here's

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,600
professional services or here's

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,559
you know better monitoring or here's you

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,440
know whatever

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,880
right it all depends on the product you

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,840
can get paid to work

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,559
on that open source project that is the

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
core

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,159
you also have to work on all the

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,079
proprietary stuff more like but you can

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,639
get paid to work on that one thing in

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,119
the

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,399
open um so that's pretty popular and you

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
can do that as well

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,760
uh but there are other companies that

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,960
will just you know pay you

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,839
to say uh we rely on debian so we need

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,040
somebody who is a debian expert can you

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,839
come on board

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,480
embed yourself in the wn project and and

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,879
then

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,520
help us be better at debian internally

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,879
um

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,079
there's not a lot of these but they do

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,359
exist so you have to do a lot of

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,440
searching

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,599
what about um different programming

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,040
languages like if you were

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
starting to just poke at a programming

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
language what are a couple that you

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,639
think

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,679
probably have a higher chance of leading

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,679
into an open source job

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
um

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,560
you know actually fortran underpins

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,000
almost

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,040
all you know it's fortran is used by the

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,480
python

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
uh data munching uh library it actually

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
is

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,400
underneath all of those things and i

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,680
think apple might be really

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,119
removing fortran from its its operating

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
systems in future versions or something

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,520
like that

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,320
anyway i saw a big kerfuffle about oh my

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
god lots of python uh data science

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
libraries aren't going to work anymore

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,839
because they're really removing pi uh

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
fortran

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,960
so fortran is still really good in some

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,400
areas if you want to do

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,359
um uh science sci it's still used in the

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,720
sciences a lot

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,960
but it depends on what you want to go

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,520
into right everything has its own

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,640
special

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,760
delicate snowflake we prefer this if you

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,560
are moving into the google in um

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,320
ecosystems raymond manipulation

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,880
manipulation yes um

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,440
that's for stuff um if you want

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,480
to work

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,320
in the google ecosystem in some way

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,800
you'll probably want to learn go if you

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,079
want to move into the android ecosystem

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,359
you will want to learn

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,440
kotlin um if you want to work just

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,040
generally in the back end of lots of

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,480
things or you want to work in data

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,160
science or

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,480
ai ml so um artificial intelligence and

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,160
and uh machine learning you will

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,520
probably want to learn python

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,200
python is one of the uh most quickly

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,560
growing languages and has been for a

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
very long time it's also one of the most

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,440
popular languages

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,359
javascript you can't go wrong with

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,680
javascript everyone needs it

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,119
python everyone needs it um but there's

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,280
nothing wrong with any language

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
so use the one that calls to you uh when

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,440
i did program i programmed in pearl

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,520
pearl really speaks to me really well

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,200
because it's written by a linguist

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,359
larry wall really loves human languages

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,040
and when i read pearl it makes so much

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,200
sense to me but i have a language

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,560
background in classical philology and so

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,720
ancient greek and latin

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,839
i read pearl and it it makes sense to me

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,160
because it reads

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,280
more like human language to me than

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
others do

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,800
and the others make sense to me but

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,599
pearl makes the most sense so you know

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,760
go with what

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,440
works for you because there are there

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,119
are definitely

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,440
um uh you know there are jobs out there

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,680
in

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,359
in every single language it just depends

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,320
on what you want to do so

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,280
figure out the area you want to try and

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
see what language

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,680
those tools are written in and then

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,960
learn that language

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,599
vicky do you have advice on how to find

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,960
friendly communities like you said don't

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,000
just pick the first one

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,079
and to pick something that uh

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
maybe calls to you or has something to

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,839
do with one of your hobbies

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,560
but how do you find like a friendly

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,480
community

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,119
um well i mean obviously you have to

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,800
start with the bigger pool of you know

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,720
all the things that are interesting to

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,119
you um and then

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,240
look at all of the projects that you

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,440
know kind of

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,040
pull your chain a little bit it's like

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,800
oh that's that's ringing my bell let me

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,119
look at that one let me look at that one

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,200
um step one is to see whether they have

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,520
a code of conduct

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,359
uh so a code of conduct is probably

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,480
going to be just a markdown file or

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,079
whatever in their

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,760
project repository it'll be linked on

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,079
their website you know whatever that

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,160
project uses to share its information

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,839
if it doesn't have a code of conduct

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,839
then

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,520
i mean this is table stakes at this

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,079
point but um there are lots of projects

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,160
that

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,400
uh where people have resisted code of

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,680
conduct we should just be excellent to

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
each other and we're just going to say

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,839
that

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,560
um and unfortunately what excellent

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,480
means

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,320
varies by person and person so having a

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,240
code of conduct really sets up

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
this is not welcome that is not welcome

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,720
this is fine that is not and it makes it

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
a lot

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,359
clearer that the project has done a lot

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,640
of thinking about how to make it a

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,880
welcoming space for

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,680
everyone so a project that hasn't done

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
that

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,359
is um and hasn't committed to that in

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,599
writing

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,640
by putting a code of conduct out there

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,960
might not

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
be a safe space for you it might be it

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,599
might be perfectly fine

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,960
but you know if you have other options

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,800
go with the other option

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,240
because you really don't want to put

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,119
yourself to that position where you

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
might be

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,440
you know belittled you might be uh

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,160
someone might be biased against you

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,720
because of

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,000
your gender identity or your racial

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,040
identity or

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you know the fact that you came from

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,200
uh you're a self-taught programmer or

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,560
anything like or that you're not a

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,760
programmer at all

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,200
right so try to if you can

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
see whether you can find something that

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,000
has a code of conduct

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,560
um and then lurk a little bit um and by

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,720
that i mean

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,640
don't just dive in and automatically

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,079
start contributing

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,839
spend some time in the community you

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,400
know join their mailing lists or

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,040
or their irc channel or if they use it

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,119
you know go

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,320
to slack or discord or whatever that is

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
uh they happen to use

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,880
um and you know see how people

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,000
interact are they mean to each other

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,839
uh do they support each other do they

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,359
answer questions quickly and

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,960
appropriately

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,040
you know and see how they interact

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,520
before you start to commit yourself

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,520
because if uh you get into a community

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,119
that is always just sort of snippy and

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,880
backbiting on each other

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,319
that might not be a good experience for

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,599
you and it might not be the most

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,599
supportive place for you

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,440
as a new contributor so see whether

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,079
there might be someplace else where you

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,560
can

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,160
invest your time and it really is an

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,920
investment in time it's worth

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,520
remembering that if you are

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,200
you're doing this probably on your free

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,040
time maybe you're getting paid for it

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,520
good on you mate if that's happened but

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,200
um if not this is your free time

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,800
you don't have a lot of that and once

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,200
you spend it it is

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,839
gone right you don't want to just spend

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,680
that on

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,880
anything you want to spend that where

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,560
it's going to make a difference and

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,880
where you can get something out of it

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,960
even if that's something be enjoyment

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,880
rather than moving your career forward

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,280
so don't try not to spend it on

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,640
you know worthless crap that's just

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,319
going to make you feel bad

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
um you know sometimes we all need the

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,960
reese's peanut butter cups and potato

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
chips right

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,440
fine but if you eat a complete diet of

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,240
that you're going to be like crap and

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
that's what

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,359
joining a bad open source project is

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
like where they're not welcoming and

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,680
supportive you don't want to

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,880
feel like crap afterward well and also

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,440
as you mentioned before

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,240
like building your career network like i

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
mean

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,160
picking a dysfunctional project is a

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
great way to find a new dysfunctional

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,880
boss

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,359
so oh that is so well somebody tweet

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,720

but we can go

a little bit long um i just wanted to

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,520
solicit the audience to see if anybody

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,599
else had any particular questions

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,280

i am very cognizant of the fact that

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,200
nobody's been

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,880
asking questions um does anyone want to

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,640
know what it's like to write a textbook

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,240
or to pitch a textbook or

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
anything like that anyone interested in

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,920
that i'm actually

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,119
curious if the attendees are coming at

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,800
this from you know

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,400
like an established contributor

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
perspective or

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,599
if they're actually just curious how can

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,640
i contribute even if i'm not

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,640
a software developer

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,720
if if there's any feedback from people

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,839
in the audience about that

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,400
yeah now that that's uh that's a great

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,839
question david is it david or dave

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,720
you know there's so many dave's and

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,400
david's that i've given up on uh

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,079
choosing one or the other whenever

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,359
there's two of us i'm

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,800
they get their preference and i'm the

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:54,400
other one so okay so go nuts

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,720
and the nudge is already taken so

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,440
that's there's that's probably a good

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,359
thing

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,960
yeah you know there's some famous people

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,920
named nugent that i don't

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,119
uh associate with too strongly so what

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,880
it's worth one of my

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,079
dearest friends um has a a dual

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,760
last name and one of those is nugent so

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
when i saw your name i was like oh my

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,200
gosh yay

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,440
so i'm predisposed to like you because

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,440
of that

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,319
um so do we have no questions from the

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,720
audience and nobody want to chime in

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,319
about

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,160
you know where they're coming from as

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,760
far as uh

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,599
uh contributing to open source oh we

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,359
have two in q a now

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,200
you know maybe they're they're lurking

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,400
just to see what the question format

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,480
should be like

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,599
oh how do you zero in on a topic to

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,280
write about

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:48,160
and then i'll read the other one um

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,040
that's a so this is a book uh for a book

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,040
yes tinisha

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,160
is it tanisha or tanisha i'm going to go

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,680
with tanisha and

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,880
apologies if i mispronounce it um

00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,920
how do you zero in on a topic well

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,040
it i can tell you how

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,119
i zero it in on a topic uh and

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,560
then we can kind of spin off from there

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,920
so how i zero it in

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,520
is that brian came to me and he said

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,240
andy hunt who uh is the publisher of

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,720
pragmatic bookshelf published my book

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,520
their

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,359
wonderful wonderful place um i

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,560
pronounced it right thank you tanisha

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,880
um so andy hunt bro brian came to me and

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,079
said

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,440
andy hunt thinks there ought to be a

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,880
book about how to contribute to open

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
source what do you think and i was like

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,160
well yeah of course there should be a

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,319
book to contribute um

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,720
you're gonna write it right and this is

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,640
of course all paraphrased um

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,319
because brian would never present it in

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,240
that way but

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,000
uh i have been hot and thought about it

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,640
a little bit um

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,760
so have coffee with brian is that that's

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,440
what i'm hearing

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,319
i i think it was irc with brian um

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,800
i i think i was in manchester at the

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,920
time

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,880
um manchester uk and oh for

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,720
crystal's event the free node live no

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,760
that was bristol

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,040
oh man manchester was uh

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,440
floss uk i think

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,040
um i was keynoting floss uk manchester

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,680
is a great industrial city i really

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,119
enjoyed it

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,319
really nice art museum um uh

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,040
yeah and brian said hey pretty much 100

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,520
how it happened

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,400
would you like to do this and i was like

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,280
a book

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
are you kidding me um and i thought

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,640
about it and

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
what brought me around to doing it

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,079
because i

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,960
scared absolutely petrified of writing a

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,720
book

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,560
um two things brought me around to doing

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,319
it number one

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,079
we didn't have a book about how to do

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,040
this and

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,800
we were about 40 years overdue okay not

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,480
quite thirty years probably 35 years

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,680
overdue for that um

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,760
so um i i felt

00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,359
that needed to happen and i was

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,119
qualified to do it

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,400
um even though i was petrified and the

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,319
second reason

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,599
i said yes is that i got to do it with

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,280
brian

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
um and i knew that he would be there to

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,400
help support me and that he really

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,800
really knew his stuff

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,480
um and i honestly could not have done

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
this without brian's help so he's going

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,560
to be all modest about it and he's

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,680
probably

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,119
blushing right now over there in

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,160
pennsylvania but um he's wonderful and i

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,240
couldn't have done that

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,240
now as far as what you want to do right

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,839
if you want to write a book look at the

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,720
things that interest you

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,119
and look at the questions and the

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,680
problems that you've solved

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,160
and it could be that the problems you're

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,000
solving

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,640
are problems other people are having

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,359
that you can then share with them

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,079
um and you can do it either in an

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,640
article

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,359
you can do it in a talk and if there's

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,920
enough

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,760
there you can do it in a book but it's i

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,520
think really important

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,040
and this is my bias showing because i do

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,480
write for pragmatic bookshelf

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,599
um that it be pragmatic and it'd be

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,319
useful it not just be a here is my

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,359
memoir of something i did right well

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,520
that's a different

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,280
book exactly that's a totally different

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,720
book um and it might be

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,480
interesting and entertaining but it's

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
not going to help people get

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,359
something done so what can you do to

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,240
help people accomplish their goals

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,480
right um like i could have just written

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,119
a random book about open source

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,359
and that would have been a decent book

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,280
but targeting specifically here is how

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,680
you contribute to open source

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
is actually much more useful so look for

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,920
something

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,599
useful and we have one more question

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,079
vicki i don't know if you want to get to

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,040
that one before we let everyone go

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,839
um savannah self says i have experiences

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,000
at unless

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,079
curator for ontologies and i have an

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
extracurricular interest in open source

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,680
i think they go together very well

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,440
but it's not like any of that is really

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,800
a job title and i would like to further

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,480
my path in that

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,880
how would you recommend finding a

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,240
community to lurk

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,520
oh wow um so

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,160
ontologies that's going to be more in

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,200
i'm going to put you in the glam space

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,480
um

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,280
uh savannah so um

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,160
glam for those of you who don't know

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,440
galleries

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,520
libraries archives archives and museums

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,680
um and i also often add uh glamza so

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,079
galleries libraries archives museums

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,880
zoos and aquariums because these are all

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,800
really open

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,240
spaces um uh so there are lots of open

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,440
source projects around

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,359
glam um for libraries and archives and

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,880
cataloging and things like that

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:48,079
so um look up some of those and see

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,880
whether your skills might be useful

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,480
um i i'm pretty sure they will there's

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,280
not enough people who are

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,640
uh who have your skills frankly at all

00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,079
in the world so thank you

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,680
um but in general uh i think that's some

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,720
place where you might see something that

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,160
you understand

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,400
and you might be able to chip in a

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,440
little better so you'll understand

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,359
a bit more of the domain rather than

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,440
just diving into for instance

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,680
open source governance which is

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,319
something that a project that i released

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,079
recently

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:23,359
um which is unzotero which itself

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,800
is like a ontology right

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,200
yeah yeah exactly um uh and it's some

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,359
a problem that i'm going to be resolving

00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,760
um for

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:35,520
the false governance collection soon um

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,200
so the false governance collection is

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,760
exactly what it says on the tin

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,599
a collection of governance documents for

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,040
free and open source software projects

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,880
because every time you have a questions

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,559
like well how do i do my voting i don't

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,160
know how does everyone else do it

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,079
you have to go and do a billion and one

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,440
web searches well how about you just go

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,280
to one website

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,559
and look at all the documents tagged

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,480
voting

00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,520
well that tagging is an ontology um

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,760
and before i'm able to open

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,720
up contributions to other people in

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,559
zotero

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,480
i need to figure out how to standardize

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,520
the ontology

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,000
so we all can be using the same tagging

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,640
for for these documents now that's a

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,160
problem that

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,160
i have already with just this one

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,839
project that i've released other

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,839
projects have this as well and they

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,880
might not know it

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,440
so finding projects that are working on

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,640
for instance their documentation

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,480
um the drupal documentation project is

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,079
excellent and they really help people

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
land new uh

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,440
patches so that might be a place where

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,839
you can help

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,000
with their um categorization their

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,839
cataloging of their projects um

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,440
openstack also has really good

00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,559
documentation project there are lots of

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,599
projects out there

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,319
um and write the docs is a really good

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,319
place to

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,440
find projects that are working on their

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,160
documentation

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,200
um and read the docs is the open source

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,599
project

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,359
that is that is behind the write the

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,880
docs uh

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,680
um uh just community i guess it is a big

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,599
community

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,200
so there are places where you can go for

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,599
that um

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,319
so um if you have any other questions
