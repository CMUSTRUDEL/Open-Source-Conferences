there

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,319
and this is um uh

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,560
just as uh last year

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920
i was saying during my session today uh

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
last year

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
we had just arranging windows on the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,080
screen here

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,000
um yeah we had a book signing live at

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
all things open where we were in like

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
the main

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
lobby atrium area of the conference and

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
like a hundred people

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,879
lined up and me and lee calco were

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,920
sitting there signing books for people

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,800
and

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
um i'll say funny story from that so we

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
have this

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,760
box of sharpie pens to use and we have

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
like

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
12 different colors or whatever like it

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
was a 12 back an eight pack of different

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
colors

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
and um one of the people in line i was

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
signing with a purple pen

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,760
and one of the people in line was like

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
could you sign my book but

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,920
do not sign in purple ink because

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,360
i don't like purple ink at all so you

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,040
gotta pick another color

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,440
but it was uh yeah you get all kinds of

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
people showing up to this uh

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,000
this so there are cool people just like

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,239
that that prefer a um

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,799
a pen color uh within this but

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:43,120
i'm gonna sign my first book here

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,799
this is uh all day devops hey

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,200
first book feedback loops volume

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,319
two that's uh is part of it so are we

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,519
gonna do live

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,640
chat here i have that so this this

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
is a really open session and i guess

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
it's it's kind of up to you

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,239
to some extent it's up to the attendees

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
um but this could be

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
a presentation that you'd like to give

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
we could talk about the process of

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
writing the book or the reception that

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
the book has gotten

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,319
or i encourage everybody in the audience

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,959
i'm sure derek would agree ask your

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
questions

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
about you know the process of writing a

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
book about the contents of the book

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,479
because

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,639
you have the author here at your

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,040
disposal signing books

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
in different colors of ink not purple

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
yeah not per

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
i purposely did not pick up the purple

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
pen although my daughter

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,120
probably would have you know complained

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,360
that i stole her purple pen

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,919
so uh jessie and desi both

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,720
have sort of similar comments what is

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,440
the book about

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
and what's the history of the book it's

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
about

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
uh my growing up in the appalachian

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
appalachian mountains oh the number of

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,440
attendees is dropping

00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,639
no i'm just kidding it's about devops so

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,280
um here here's a little story and i'll

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,919
kind of go through this as i sign and

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,759
excuse me while i don't look at the

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,000
camera and sign at the same time i

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,759
haven't practiced that

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,360
don't look and sign bit but um

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,160
so uh five years ago

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
my colleague mark miller and i founded

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,479
uh

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,199
what is the all-day devops conference

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,960
and the all-day devops conference was

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,240
set up in 2016

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
as a virtual conference um so we were

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
doing

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,080
we've we were doing and have been doing

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
a

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,320
large virtual conference every year for

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,520
the last five years um and

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,039
uh the reason that we set up the

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,199
more background because we have enough

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
time to talk through it but the reason

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,160
that we set this up

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,080
is mark and i were going to devops

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,720
devops days conferences other

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
conferences around the industry and we

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
would meet

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,160
people like josh atwell

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,800
john willis damon edwards courtney

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,280
kissler nicole forsgren

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
and i was speaking at these conferences

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,240
mark was speaking and

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,280
you kind of see the same speakers travel

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
from one location to the next so we all

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
got to know each

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,199
other but we would run into someone like

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,720
oh i'm meeting jeff from red hat or

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,560
amy from state farm i was like oh cool

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
like how many people do you have in your

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
devops practice and the answer would be

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
anything from

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
oh there's like seven of us we're small

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,440
or there's like

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,919
700 of us back at the at the office

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,319
but there's only two of us here at

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
devops days because

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
you know our boss can only afford x

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
amount of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
payment for the devops days or required

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,759
travel

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
you know to this location i can show you

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,360
the uh

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,039
the book stack is getting higher here um

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,160
because i'm slow at this but um

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,000
the uh so we started off this this

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
conference and we said

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
let's make something let's make a

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,720
conference

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,919
where all 700 of the people

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,800
at that company can show up and be

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,520
part of this experience and in order to

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
do that

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,000
we needed to go online and we need to

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,479
make it free

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and the first year we did this it was a

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,479
15-hour event

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
and the second year we did it we turned

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
it into a 24-hour event

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
because we got to we wanted everyone to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
attend

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,240
no matter where they were in the world

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
and we run five tracks for the

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
conference there's modern infrastructure

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
there's

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,000
sre devsecops cicd

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
cultural transformation there's a

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,919
government track

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
uh now within the conference all the q a

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,879
is done on slack so

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,960
attendees interact and so that

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,240
first year we started with the concept

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,160
that a thousand people were going to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
participate in this conference because

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
five years ago that would have been the

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,520
biggest

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,759
devops conference ever even like devops

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
enterprise summit was only about 500

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,720
people

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,120
at that time and today it's like 2 000

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,240
something

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,599
so 13 000 people showed up 90 days after

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
we started this concept

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,000
13 000 people showed up to the first one

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,479
that created all day devops and as

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
part of how the conference evolved over

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,760
time

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
uh and what led to the first book and

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,560
then to the second book

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,640
is uh we have you know this year we'll

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,160
have 180 speakers presenting

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
over 20 24 hours the six tracks that we

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,720
have

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,959
plus keynotes and um we

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
uh in the first couple of years that we

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
were doing this

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,600
i would write up summaries of uh

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
the sessions that happen so league came

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
and spoke about this

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
mary came and spoke about this um you

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
know

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,880
our friend um uh uh

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
muhammad and i was trying to think like

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,720
i had the picture of the

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
the face but not the the name so our

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
friend muhammad in paris they would

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,760
present on a session

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,480
and i would just do a blog write up like

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,480
hey mohammed was talking about cicd

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
pipelines at this conference here's some

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
of what he introduced

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,880
here are some snapshots of slides that

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
he used during the

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,839
the conference and then we um we

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
would publish those blogs on the all day

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,560
devops site

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,800
and so what you get after you know

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,399
weeks of doing this and months of doing

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
this we have like

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,920
30 blogs throughout the year that cover

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
different sessions from

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,480
the conference we took all those and

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
combined them into a book

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
so that people can learn about all

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,560
different experiences

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
from the the conference and so the book

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,800
is a compilation

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,320
of this book has

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,200
48 chapters in it so the chapters are

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
things like

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
shifting security left devsecop's

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,399
journey in the

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,959
department of defense why manual

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,920
verification still matters

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,440
sink or swim or sink why training

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,760
matters to an sre practice

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
building secure and reliable systems a

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,519
conversation with google's

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,959
sre book authors um

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,720
and a whole host of other topics uh

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,800
that are done throughout the book so we

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
highlight the speaker from

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
that that particular session some of the

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,959
key points that they made and key

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
lessons learned so it's a good book

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
covering kind of

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
all different a very wide range of

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,519
different topics

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,399
from the industry and as part of this

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,079
another thing that makes all day devops

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,360
kind of a special experience

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,880
let me get more books here

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
this is this is the definition of

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,720
multitasking right here yeah

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
i have stacks of boxes nobody can even

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
complain about it because you're signing

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
books for them and by the way if

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
if you don't know what these books are

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,560
for make sure you scroll up in the chat

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,480
and find the link where you can actually

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,399
get a copy of these books get a copy um

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,600
yeah so um so that's how the book uh

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
came about is just a collection of these

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
different stories but what i was gonna

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
say is

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
one of the things that makes all day

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
devops

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
interesting in the way that we put it

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
together was you know mark and i

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and everyone else has been to tons of

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
different conferences

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
and on occasion at conferences you you

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
can see

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
what what i'll call as vendor pitches or

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
product pitches

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,240
and you can pay to be part of

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
conferences which enable you to come on

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,959
and do

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
product pitches but what we what we

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,279
didn't want to do was

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
stay awake for 24 hours and hear a bunch

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
of vendors

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,399
giving product pitches so we have a no

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
vendor pitch policy

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,360
as part of the the conference so we have

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
people that work at vendors that are

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
presenting

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
but they're usually presenting as you

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
know devrel people

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
like here's the actual practical stuff

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,880
that i'm doing that's helpful not

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,560
talking about my products per se

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,959
um and then uh we have practitioners

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,200
from

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,120
you know people from state farm or

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,240
general motors financials

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,160
or toyota or wherever they might be

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
that come and present at the conference

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
and and

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,839
the kind of cool thing and you'll see

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,360
this in the book as well

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,480
is where as some

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,760
like vendor-oriented conferences

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,399
go there's the story about like

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
oh you know the uh come here the

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,040
sonotype stories and sona type products

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,040
and

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,720
i wasn't using these before and i had

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,200
this challenge and then i bought this

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
thing and got the solution and then like

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,000
this you know the miracle story happens

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,160
hollywood script and in

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
all day devops and i think similar to

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,959
all things open

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,880
in the way that it's run is with no

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
vendor pitch policies you just get like

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
hey we started off in devops three years

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
ago this is what we learned year one

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,440
this is what we learned year two these

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,200
are the mistakes that we made these are

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
the other mistakes that we made

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
and we're still learning and you don't

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,800
get this like

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
glory like we got to the glory land kind

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,000
of story because

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,079
it there is no glory land in

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
you know in devops you just continue to

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,040
evolve and

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
share as uh as it goes along so that's a

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,880
that's a really good point

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,199
and you know i love that philosophy from

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,639
a conference perspective as a

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,199
conference organizer in sort of the

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,880
software field there are so many

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
conferences out there where

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,639
not only is there like a no vendor pitch

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
policy but

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,839
maybe all the talks are sponsored or

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,560
yeah contributed by vendors in some

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
in some areas so those are pretty easy

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,600
if you've been around for a while those

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,800
are pretty easy to spot

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
right if you're new to conferences and

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
kind of

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,800
new to the space they might not be as

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,320
easy to spot

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,240
yeah so i definitely appreciate that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
um we have a couple questions if you're

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,160
if you're up for it yeah

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,040
uh so john asks and and this question by

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,959
the way ends

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,680
hopefully you understand this question

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,680
so let's give it a shot

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,800
the best best kind of questions

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,639
literally ask me anything

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,079
jessie's laughing in the background

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
going to you

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,839
do you notice that companies tend to

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,079
jump on the keyword bandwagon for

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
different types of dev practices agile

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,560
waterfall

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,000
devops devsecops etc instead of taking a

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
look at what is or isn't working in

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
their environment and taking best

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
practices for each style and fitting it

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,560
into their environment

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,000
instead of trying to transform their

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,519
environment into the keyword practice

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,320
yeah um there uh that's a it's a good

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,440
question and i think one that is

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,560
continually

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,560
asked across this industry

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
and especially with you know the folks

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,920
that i get to hang around with

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
in the industry we're always kind of

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,440
questioning

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
what are people doing what's the next

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
thing

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,639
um you know at the beginning there was a

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,759
lot of is devops real

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,399
is this just for the unicorns out there

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,720
um

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,519
you know is are people using the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,639
buzzword or actually practicing

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,600
um so a couple of comments

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,000
that and directions that i'll take that

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
one

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,720
is that uh i should like focus the

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
camera down a little more and then you

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,880
can see i

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,959
i'm actually signing all these books i'm

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,040
not just pretending that i'm signing the

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,079
books um

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,000
but so so one thing is i run a

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
a survey each year i've done this for

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,199
six years and it's

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,279
the devsecops community survey and as

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,040
part of that

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,079
and similar for a similar length of time

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,519
the state of devops

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,000
report and survey have been run

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,839
and you get to see the evolution of the

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,639
industry in terms of

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
adopting practices and we ask enough

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,360
questions

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,399
within these these surveys that

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,680
you get a sense of whether you

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,880
call it devops or not you may be doing

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880
the practices

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
some people choose they want to call it

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,360
devops rally around the term

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,279
that may help them in their own

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,600
internals there's part of just

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
you know we have a process to evolve how

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,480
we develop

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
software we're not going to call it

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
devops we don't need to call it some

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,120
people like

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,360
i'm working with the folks at state farm

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,120
they have a big internal program that

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,880
they call disrupt

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,319
they don't they use devops but

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,319
sparingly and they actually used it

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,240
so there was a funny story they were

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,319
using it internally

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
and then someone was like oh my gosh i

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,679
saw there's like some external devops

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
conference i thought that was

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
our word like i thought we had made it

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,799
up

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
and that was the thing that we were

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,240
rallying upon but they call their thing

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,280
disrupt

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,559
internally that's like a big uh

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,400
big program there um so

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,080
i don't think the terminology really

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,919
matters but what i do see

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,320
is that people are taking the practices

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,400
that devops are that a devops practice

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,520
and what it recommends and what it means

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
to kind of one first map out your value

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,120
stream

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
understand where are bottlenecks within

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
your process

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,120
where does it slow down where could it

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,480
be

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,480
faster um and some of that is just led

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,000
from a

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,039
from an internal perspective um

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,960
that we want to be better at what we do

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,000
and other parts are built in

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,799
we have competitors out there that i've

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
seen in

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,160
conference presentations their employees

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,080
have given that says

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
they're getting faster they're

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,240
implementing these practices that we are

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
not we're getting behind we're less

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,080
competitive we need to catch up

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
um and so there are different

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
motivations that

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,240
inspire the movement toward this but

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:48,160
i think we're well beyond the

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,280
devops uh the the thought that it's just

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
a buzzword

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,600
that there is enough of the industry um

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,200
that is implementing it

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,400
and advancing it and that one of the

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,559
studies i just did with gene kim

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
earlier this year and i was presenting

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,400
on

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,600
uh earlier was when it comes to a

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,400
practice like devops or

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,840
devsecops about 25 percent of the

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,520
organizations that we

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,880
surveyed are in what we would consider

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,880
a more mature state of devsecops

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:27,039
versus beginning devops practices versus

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:32,080
we're still stuck on waterfall or

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:36,320
agile practices or slower develop

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,160
slower velocity development practices

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
now that said the second point that i

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
wanted to make around

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
devops and kind of the the catch-on of

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
the phrase is how many people are using

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,559
it in their titles

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,280
that i think there's a lot of people

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,919
that decided to go on linkedin or

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
whatever

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,640
and you know say i'm going to call

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,880
myself a devops engineer because

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
i'm kind of doing some part of this or

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
i'd like to be recognized

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
as doing some part of this or i could

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
make 20

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,520
more money by getting hired somewhere as

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
a devops engineer versus a software

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,880
engineer

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,559
and therefore i'm going to jump on that

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,919
bandwagon because it's economically

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,400
beneficial to me that has definitely

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,600
happened

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,159
because and started years ago

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
because we were just seeing a bunch of

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,799
people in

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
organizations come up with this title

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,280
when

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,840
most people are still trying to figure

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,760
out what it was uh and it just

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,039
it felt too early for the numbers that

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,559
were out there i'm gonna

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
grab some more books i hope everybody

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,159
appreciates how hard derek is working

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,679
for all of you throughout this session

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
you know because it's a 45 minute

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,480
session and he's

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
hauling books all around so i'm just

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
gonna

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
paste that link uh one more time

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
um so that you can get some of these

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,640
books

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,360
out of derrick's house get a

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,520
new book out here so uh any more

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,600
questions that have come in i'm happy to

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,919
actually there's uh one from ed and this

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,200
is this is right up your alley is there

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,240
an ebook version either now or planned

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,039
no because ebooks are like so pass a no

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
no i'm just kidding i like to joke a

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,640
little

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,559
yes there is an ebook version so um

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,039
also i you know i should say just as

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,960
well as there is an ebook version

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,960
um if you go to alldaydevops.com

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,000
and actually register for the conference

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
right after that

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,640
page there's a it comes up with thanks

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
for registering here are some cool

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,159
resources

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,919
and the ebook version is part of that

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:49,120
it's a pdf uh version of the book so

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
you can have both the physical copy and

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,000
the

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,559
um uh in the electronic copy

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,039
now i i will also say if you're just

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
like

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,520
dying to get a hold of this book and

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,679
you're just thinking derek's signing

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,880
these but it's going to take me forever

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,200
to get a hold of it you could order it

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,799
on

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,520
amazon and it's like 14 but

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,520
if you want to save your 14 for like a

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,559
couple of really nice trips to

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,080
starbucks or you know some of that like

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,640
great local ramen place or something

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,320
you know for lunch then um don't go to

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,080
amazon and buy it

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,120
i make zero money off of any amazon book

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,000
sales

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,520
we basically put it on amazon at cost as

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,919
a convenience

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,840
um but you can if you want volume one

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,960
and hard copy it's still on

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,320
amazon you can order that uh there

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,559
as well awesome yeah you know we

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,480
we previously did a book signing session

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
where derek was autographing the ebooks

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
but then we had to buy him a new laptop

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
because the screen got all covered with

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
it yeah i'm really much

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,440
i'm much happier that we're doing the

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,280
physical copies yeah

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
yeah i was eating chocolate and it got

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,440
all green

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
and everything it was just a complete

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
complete

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
messy situation by the way i've noticed

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
that we do have

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,600
more attendees who have joined recently

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,039
so this is a very interactive session if

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,600
you have any questions

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,480
awesome for derrick about the process of

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
writing the book

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,360
about devsecops in general i'm going to

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,720
switch pen colors over to red

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
right now just changing things up david

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,679
i mean

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
and i know we're moving quick here i

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,039
think we can see that derek is a man who

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,880
lives on the edge and so

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,720
if you if you want an honest answer to

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
your question this is this is the place

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
for it

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,760
um i i'm actually curious just sort of

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,640
as a as a conference organizer

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
how has the feedback been you know from

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
your event

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,559
as you put it out there and then saw

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
this huge

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,960
response and then now you know are

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,960
growing yeah bigger each year uh yeah so

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
bigger each year i actually i didn't get

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,720
to that in the the earlier part of the

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,559
story but so the book for those of you

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,640
that just joined feedback loops voices

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,679
of all day devops

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,480
we capture in blogs as well as in

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,440
what ends up as chapters in this book uh

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,720
each year

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,799
i'll get and get in front of the camera

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
uh and remind me to talk about bobby

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,000
later the kid on the cover of the book

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
but

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,120
uh we uh we host this conference every

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,320

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,240
24 hours

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,080
this year it's november 12th we'll have

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,240
180 speakers

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,840
we summarize many of their talks in this

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,320
278 page book

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,559
on all different subjects from sre to

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,039
cicd to devsecops to

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
cultural transformation to a bunch of

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,840
other stuff

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
um so that you can read through they're

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
all fairly short chapters like three to

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,799
five pages

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,320
um and uh so

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,320
is part just

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,640
so maurizio's the purple pen

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:10,880
inching forward that's awesome

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,440
uh i'll need to look for a purple pen

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,799
it's hilarious or maybe if i mix the

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,799
blue and the red i can get

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
it's freaking hilarious um so in terms

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
of

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,799
it is it catching on so we had

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
39 000 people participate in all day

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,480
devops last year so

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,919
yes it has caught on um you know that

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,080
initial dream that i was telling you

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,520
about like why we did all a devops in

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,400
the first place that

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,520
we meet two people from wells fargo at

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
um

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,360
you know at the conference and they're

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,440
like yeah we have like 500 people in our

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,600
devops practice and we can't send all of

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
them to devops days or

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,080
you know whatever conference it is that

00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,000
we're at um

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,120
that last year we had

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,440
uh 4 000 people from state farm

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,799
participate in the conference so they

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,120
literally said

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,400
look this is a free conference it's on

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,679
all day it covers

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,240
all these topics we want to

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,679
train our employees on what devops is

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,880
have an opportunity for them to

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,520
participate

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
so literally everyone effectively take

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,559
the day off of

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,799
work to watch online when they were back

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,640
in their offices they were doing

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
viewing parties so they would have like

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,960
the cafeteria

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,240
area blocked off viewing screens set up

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,120
where they had

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,400
hundreds of employees watching in

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,840
different areas

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,400
and this year we have um

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,960
you can anyone can see this if they go

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,159
to the

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,520
all day devops site but one of the

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,760
cool things that that we've done

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,120
and this is in the top nav uh part of

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,640
the menu

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,600
uh actually i can share my screen right

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,240
you should be able to you okay so let's

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,520
do this

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,520
so okay nice okay so this is

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,600
on the all day devops site we have this

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,080
thing called club 20.

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,799
you see state farm has a thousand people

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,080
signed up

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,000
macquarie in australia has 200 200

200 northrop grumman has 143

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,039
but we've made an agreement with the

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,840
community to basically say if you get

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,880
20 people from your organization signed

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,919
up

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,840
we will put you on this club 20 list

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,279
uh and so we have a whole bunch of

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,440
people that are just like an

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,960
internal advocate from their

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
organization

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,720
that says hey you know i want to get on

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,440
this list can we get a bunch of people

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,720
signed up for the conference and we have

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,039
people like my friend

00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,080
um sean porus he's over at verizon media

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,000
and he's like derek i looked at the club

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,159
20 list and we're not on it this

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,520
year how many people do we have signed

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,679
up like

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,559
sean i just looked and you have like six

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,480
people signed up

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,120
i've been telling everyone to register

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,960
for this i want to get us on the list

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,840
and so then uh another guy

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,799
who his company is on the list uh leon

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,240
from

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,840
uh keurig dr pepper he had uh

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,360
where are they on the list they have 43

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,120
people signed up

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,279
so he says sean if you can get

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,760
20 people signed up to get you know

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:43,440
verizon media on the list this year

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,640
i'll send you 20 keurig dr pepper

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,279
t-shirt

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,960
it's like incentives so they're like

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,200
gamifying this

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
whole thing within the community to get

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,520
themselves on the list

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,520
but they're some it's like it seems so

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
easy to get 20 people

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,440
to register for a conference for from

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,640
your company or whatever

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
but like engineers aren't necessarily

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
the best marketers

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,440
right so they're like i'm just going to

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
tell my team and of course everyone's

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,559
going to sign up and it's like ah i

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
don't know if bob wants us to sign up

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
for something i don't know what it is so

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
i'm not gonna do it

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,720
and then they're like i just sent out a

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
whole big email to our big team we

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,679
should have more people like you have

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,640
five people registered

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,240
like they're not listening to you yeah

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
engineers are not good marketers

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,039
that's uh that's a true try and get the

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,679
cio to send out a message or something

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,200
like that you know to the the team and

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,640
but we've seen that like

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,120
i have a friend um submit agarwal

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,399
he's at broadridge financial in new

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,080
jersey and he's been

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,640
involved in the conference since year

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,200
two runs our cultural transformation

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,559
track he also helps organize devops days

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,760
new york city

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,559
uh he had the

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,559
cio of broadridge financial send out

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,919
note to say hey everyone should register

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,000
for all day devops

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
and literally in one day i want to say

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,919
they had like 275 people

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,399
register to be a part of the conference

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,039
and

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,679
but this is where like when we started

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,360
off exactly what we wanted to do like

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,919
who could have imagined someone saying

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,080
hey i work at a large enterprise like

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,559
state farm insurance and we're going to

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,919
take

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,520
4 000 people to a devops conference this

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,919
year

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,799
like think about it made any sense would

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,279
you want to work for that company

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,360
right what like what do you do for your

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,360
engineers what do you do for your devops

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,919
people like to help them learn it's like

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,760
well we give everyone the day to go to

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,039
all day devops every year and like last

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,520
year we had four thousand well

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,360
you what i can barely get three of us to

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,600
go to devops days raleigh

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
and you know participate in that and you

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,960
got fourth out like

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,320
maybe i want to go to places where

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,360
people are investing

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,159
in devops education is part of that so

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,880
we really

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,799
like it's cool to see it play off on the

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,480
club 20 list because this is where we

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,039
can actually measure

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
are we making a difference in the

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,440
reality and i think we

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,080
like we have like 40

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,000
company 42 companies on the list now by

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,640
the time we hit the conference date so

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,919
we're like

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,440
three four weeks away um we'll have 180

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,240
companies on this list

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,159
it's it gets big as a lot of people

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,279
don't register for virtual things until

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,440
the last minute

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,360
so i'm kind of curious like uh

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,799
separately from the numbers you know you

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,880
have this virtual conference that you've

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,519
been organizing for years

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,640
as well as the as well as the survey as

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,720
well as this book

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,760
um and since so much interaction is

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,080
happening

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,880
virtually with your book as well i'm

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,919
guessing

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,440
do you have any like um

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,600
have you received any feedback from

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,919
people who have attended the conference

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,679
or read the book and you know actually

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,480
put into practice changes in their

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,760
organizations

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,760
i don't have a specific story

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,960
but i do i'm putting you on the spot

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,600
here i apologize

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,440
yeah no i do get messages from people

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,240
like on linkedin and stuff

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,440
saying hey derek i got i you know i got

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,039
but they don't call out like i read

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,440
chapter 42 and showed it to my cio

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,559
and you know then things totally change

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,840
from there

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,840
um but we do have feedback

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:39,360
from the uh from people

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,919
uh that participate in the conference

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,360
that we end up meeting at live

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,200
conferences

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,799

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,200
we like hey derek it's nice to meet you

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,000
in person

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,640
we've had viewing parties at pitney

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,279
bowes

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,919
every year since you started all day

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,799
devops

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,120
and we have like our office in istanbul

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,760
our office in cologne germany

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,640
or office and you know new york and

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
dallas like

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,880
each of them has a viewing party

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,840
internally and you've

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,840
changed the way that we do devops

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,000
education

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,720
internally at our companies and we've

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,600
set up our

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,640
own internal like devops summit or

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,559
whatever

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,240
but we kind of base it on the way that

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,200
you do all day devops

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,320
uh you know we do it like on zoom kind

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,279
of thing

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
uh we have slack as a discussion channel

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,039
for everyone

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,799
involved in the conference uh switching

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,760
back to blue for those of you keeping

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,240
track

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,359
um so there are those kind of feedback

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,639
points on you've helped us learn

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,599
in a different way um or

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,280
like we're a large company and we set

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
aside time

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,159
to do this like this company altus this

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,760
communications company in portugal they

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,839
have a us office

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,679
every year they're like back with we're

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,879
a viewing party we've got you know

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,919
a rallying cry around this fedex has a

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,079
large

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,119
you know base of participants every year

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,800
that are like

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
yeah we just put it on the calendar

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,040
every year like we know this is a

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,040
conference that we can all go to

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,079
we have the budget to do it because it's

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,560
free

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,639
no one has to travel so you know we can

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,159
block off the calendars

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,560
um and so yeah it's uh

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,000
it's it's fun to meet those people in

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,880
person because

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,680
you know at the the same time i'm like

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,720
yeah we got

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,320
you know 39 000 people to register for

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,599
this thing excuse me while i

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,520
my book stacks are getting too big

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,400
i don't want them to fall over um

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,520
but you know you like i hear 39 000

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
people well i never

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,359
met those people in person and when you

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,359
run across the people

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,200
you know in person and they share these

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,560
stories of like

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
you've helped my devops education like

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,800
for the last

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,960
four or five years right it's like wow

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,800
you're a person like this is the one

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,520
thing with virtual conferences

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
unlike the physical ones is you don't

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
have that

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,839
hallway track of like meeting someone

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
face to face

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,240
it's just like oh i saw derek online he

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,160
was on some zoom with david and they

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,119
were talking about the books and he was

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
signing stuff

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,680
and i was trying to figure out what's on

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,000
his bookshelf back there

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
a picture from his kid so i feel like i

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
know him but

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,160
he has no idea that i exist out here

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,400
right

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,240
so it's pretty cool when we go to the

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,240
physical conferences and make those

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,640
connections

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
that's awesome i'm kind of curious so i

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,880
mean

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,320
you've talked about you know running the

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,119
virtual conference you've talked about

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
the book and

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,480
you've talked about some of the other um

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
things you're involved in

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,160
that you know people can get involved in

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,119
like the like the report

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,839
um do you have like day-to-day work

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,800
that's

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,359
you know still in devops devsecops or

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,839
are you

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,800
you know totally focused on education

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,880
right now

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,880
no i actually have a day job um

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,320
okay making me feel very unproductive

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,640
this is just the the fun part of what i

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,839
do but you know a good part of

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,640
um what i spend time on in the year is

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,680
what i presented on earlier today

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,280
at all things open which was this

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,720
state of the software supply chain

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
report where

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,200
we're researching high performance

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,640
development organizations

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,480
and what practices

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,760
make the difference between low

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,200
performers and

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,240
high performing organizations and

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,560
it's it's really more about spending

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
time

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,240
researching that uh understanding what

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,400
people are doing

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,800
and then educating the community at

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,839
large as to what these best practices

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,400
are so

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,560
kind of similar in a way to what dora in

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,880
the state of devops

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,640
reports were doing what nicole and jazz

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
and gene and others involved

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,480
and that were doing as part of my day

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,640
job

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,640
not organizing conferences but doing

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,839
that and

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,960
there's also part that's uh part of that

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,800
and this was

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,200
you know involved in the presentation

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,480
earlier in the day is studying

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,200
what adversaries are doing so the the

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
element

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,680
of devops that i spend more time in

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,119
is devops or devsecops so where you're

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,640
building more security

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,480
into automated pipelines

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,760
where that can make a difference how you

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,240
can do it

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,200
earlier in the shift left mentality but

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,359
also it's

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,920
security is an ongoing thing so you need

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,560
it across the dev life cycle

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,520
um you can see i'm gonna point down to

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,960
the there's like the stack of books

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,839
i made some progress

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,839
there um i'm not not just signing the

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,359
same book over and over

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,800
um the uh

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,000
so it's it's interesting to go

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,320
and work with organizations to kind of

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
consult with them on what practices make

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,000
sense

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,520
what do you implement in terms of

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
security practices

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,960
in a devops pipeline um

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,320
and there's a whole host of different

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,640
you know things that you can do

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
in that regard but i think where you

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,079
know one of the things that i brought up

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,560
earlier and i continue to bring this up

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,400
every chance that i get is

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,359
a lot of people focus on if we're going

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,880
to pursue

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,320
devops that can improve the velocity

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,760
of our development practice

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,240
we can get more value

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,880
more valuable features or products to

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,079
market

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,520
faster than our competitors in this

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,240
space and in the realm of devsecops

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,040
the important thing for people to

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,320
understand

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,880
is for security you're only

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,440
looking at security investments because

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,480
you have

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,839
adversaries and

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,000
if you say like we've implemented this

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,920
devops practice and we used to release

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,720
software twice a year

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,720
and now we're releasing it twice a month

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,560
right so it's like

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,320
applause to you things have gotten

00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,440
better i'm sure your employees are

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,200
happier

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,640
there um but in the application security

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,400
realm when you look at

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,800
adversary behavior the average adversary

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,920
can

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,400
breach your application environment with

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,319
new vulnerabilities disclosed in under

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,160
three days

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,560
if you can release new versions

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,000
or updates to your software once every

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,280
two weeks

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,839
your adversaries have an 11 day lead

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,640
on like new vulnerabilities out today

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,119
our process

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,720
says we can get new code into production

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,920
in two weeks

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,040
following our standard automated devops

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,119
practice

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,400
right but the adversaries can do it in

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,040
three

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,240
you're focused on internal metrics and

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,280
benchmarks

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,119
and not the external factors that

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
that matter and it you know in some

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,200
cases when you're just looking at

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,800
engineering practices like hey we're

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,800
getting faster

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,240
when you look at security practices you

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,319
have to measure that against what are

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,160
your adversaries able to do

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,160
because if it took adversaries a month

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,160
to break in but you can deploy

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,280
and change the environment every two

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,319
weeks

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,400
you're safe right but that's enough time

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,520
to print a new box for your software to

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,760
ship it to the store

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,280
i mean yep if it could be a month that

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,160
would be great well but then i guess

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,119
there would be a

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,960
bit less interest in uh in your field um

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,640
we just have a few minutes left i was

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,000
curious if you could

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,480
and again this is putting you on the

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,680
spot so feel free to just uh choose your

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,040
own question here but

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,280
uh tell us you know what are the the hot

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,560
topics going to be in the next year

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,440
in the devsecops field

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,079
um well i certainly don't know all of

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,119
them

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:54,000
but um you know a lot of um

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:57,520
growing interest coming in in um

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,200
uh chaos engineering uh certainly

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,960
something that's getting a lot more

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,319
attention where you know

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,119
netflix started the journey with chaos

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,560
monkey

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:12,240
and uh all the other

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,079
uh simian army uh components

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,079
uh on how do you

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,319
how do you introduce

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,560
[Music]

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,160
changes in the environment to see how

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,280
resilient the environment

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,400
is i think as part of that you know

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,520
sre practices are getting more attention

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,000
and able to get be going more

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,520
mainstream i think this is an area that

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,760
people are still

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,400
wanting to learn a whole lot more about

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:47,119
if you if you're in one of the camps on

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,200
sre and i want to learn more dave renson

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,040
two years ago i think at all day devops

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,680
and all of our all-day devops talks were

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,119
still online

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,560
gave an amazing keynote on sre he's

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,200
uh manager of google fabulous if you

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
look up

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,839
dave renton all day devops you'll

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,839
find it easily on google

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,720
but that that is getting a lot more

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,760
attention i think that the other thing

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,200
that is coming

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,040
into play that is a change so

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,119
ten years ago and i had i have the book

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,280
sitting over there um

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,119
jez humble and dave farley wrote

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,920
continuous delivery

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,760
so there was this concept of like if

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,599
we're going to do continuous delivery

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,800
what do we need to know what do we need

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,359
to know about

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,560
what we're building how we're building

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,680
how we test it

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,920
how we maintain quality how we build

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,839
build quality and build security and

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:51,119
how do you architect your environment

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,119
and so forth that

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
that concept worked well when you're

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
moving from

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,680
waterfall to something more continuous

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,280
and higher velocity

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,960
but there is a new cd

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,319
that is continuous deployment right and

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,359
it's not just about

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,839
can you get changes across the finish

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,079
line

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:20,079
faster but if you're going into these

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,240
cloud-based cloud-native environment

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
environments for your applications that

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,880
are always

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,960
on then what does continuous deployment

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,560
mean of the changes within these

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,440
environments that it's

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,319
not just the delivery of we got it

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,560
across the finish line but deployment

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,520
account for literally everything

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,480
infrastructure

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,040
everything whoever your cloud provider

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,520
is

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,640
everything in terms of user changes and

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,079
monitoring that

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,520
so i think it's a broader

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,599
definition of what started out as the

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,640
continuous delivery movement but

00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,640
i think that continuous deployment is

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
something that people don't understand

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,200
well enough

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,720
there are companies like harness that

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,040
are backing

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,760
that on the chaos engineering side i

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,800
know

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,520
varica is doing a lot of good work with

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,359
some of the

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,880
people that started the chaos

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,000
engineering movement within

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,040
netflix a couple of my friends also

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,079
james wicket karthik

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,160
uh gaywad and ernest mueller

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,400
they were three of the people that

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
started all day devops with us five

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,720
years ago they ran

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,800
the uh they've run the modern

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,599
infrastructure track for years from

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,079
austin

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,440
uh so good friends of mine keeping track

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,599
but

00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,319
[Music]

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,800
yeah that's a little bit of what i you

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,520
know

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
foresee but i'm i'm not a fortune teller

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,400
so i

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,839
you know can't say well all right so you

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,119
heard it here first derek just

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,280
that's right exactly what's going to

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,200
happen for the next 12 months

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,640
when i'm at all things open next year

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,920
you can come up to me and say you know

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,000
you predicted that thing that was going

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,119
to happen and never took off like

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,800
but you did get a book

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,560
just in the hole with me like

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,800
awesome you can sign a book but you

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,040
can't predict the future

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,720
we're right at 15 minutes to the hours i

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,400
think at this point um

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,319
if nobody has any other questions we'll

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,319
close it up but i just wanted to

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,160
thank you derek for sharing your

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,040
knowledge with us sharing your books

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,839
with us

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,800
also i have derek's twitter posted in

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,680
the chat

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,839
and a link to the that's me the all day

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,680
devops conference

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,119
which obviously you should sign up for

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,599
november 12th i

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,560
we always say sign up yourself and

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,000
encourage your

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,119
entire team to sign up get your team on

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,079
club 20 so we can put your logo up on

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,400
the site

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,280
and then people will see that and say

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,599
wow they got

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,400
20 people to work they must be investing

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
in

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
education of their devops pros there

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
maybe i should go

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,720
and work there and you know some great

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,400
promotional uh promotional opportunity

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,280
for anyone's company that wants to

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,119
participate

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
so david thank you for being such a

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,800
great host and

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,160
chatting with me while i'm signing the

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,079
books and

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,520
no i'm looking forward to the conference

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,280
and you know as opposed to like a

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,880
tupperware party i'm sure everybody that

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,000
you recommend it to will enjoy it

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,839
so it's uh it's definitely a good thing

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,839
