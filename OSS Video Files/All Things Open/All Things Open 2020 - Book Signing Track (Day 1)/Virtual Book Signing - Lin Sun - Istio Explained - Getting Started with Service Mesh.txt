hey folks good morning good afternoon

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
uh so thrilled to be here so we're going

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,280
to talk about

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,119
our book uh is still explained

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,320
so let me go ahead uh share my screen

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,720
uh if i can share screen successfully uh

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
too

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
okay can you guys uh see my screen i

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
just

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,559
run through a live demo in my session

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,000
previously

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,239
so that's why you're seeing some

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,239
background there

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,440
okay so let me quickly introduce myself

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,480
my name is linsa i'm a senior technical

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
staff member

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,760
and also a master inventor with ibm

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
i've been working for ibm for a long

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,480
time

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,640
ibm is a co-founder of the istio open

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,879
source projects i've been working

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
on the project for a little bit over

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,680
three years now

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,119
this is actually my fourth year speak

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,640
about istio at atl

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,159
so great honor to be here

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,200
so last year we wrote a book

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,880
with my co-author dan berg

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,439
about istio explained it's really to

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,320
help our users to get started

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,320
with service mesh for those of you are

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
not familiar with

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
o'reilly they do have a format called

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,439
report

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,280
i actually learned this myself so the

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,479
report

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,320
is reserved for books that's like

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,960
75 pages or less so this is a really

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,240
short

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,680
book so who is this book

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,119
really for interestingly you know when

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
we write the book we were mostly

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,439
focusing uh you know

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
what do we want to write the book and

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,280
sometimes we forgot

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,360
you know who are these books really for

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
so let's make sure you know

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,479
we're level set on that so we wrote this

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
book

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,040
really for the developers

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,800
of microservices the operators

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,000
who are operating microservices

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,440
in in their corporates who

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,319
are like the platform owners uh who

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,160
you know looking at their service mesh

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,599
strategies

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,120
to enforce

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,760
policies for their developers

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
micro services so these are the

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,879
different roles we're looking at

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,000
also like security offices who wants

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,680
make sure their

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
platform is secure uh the service owners

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
who

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
owns the services so these are the

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
different

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
roles we really wrote the book for and

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
this is a getting started book so the

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
book

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,480
is really helping users to learn

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
what is service mesh what are the

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
challenges

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,560
in the microservice space to lead to

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,879
the introduce of service mesh

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,720
it will talk about like the histories of

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,519
service mesh what is like the

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,440
pre-service mesh with netflix

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
uh what are the challenges with

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,319
kubernetes when you run service

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,959
messaging

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,280
in kubernetes you know what does t

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,000
kubernete didn't give to you

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
that may not make you happy when you

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
need to

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,120
run microservices

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,159
and how service mesh works with

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,360
data playing control plane and also

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,760
taking a look at the current service

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
mesh

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,239
landscape we will introduce you

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,799
to different projects in service mesh

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
there are six seven projects i think we

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
talked about

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,280
such as envoy such as

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,599
app mesh such as aspen mesh different

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,480
companies in this landscape

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,080
we will talk about like smi in this

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,720
landscape

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
link d which is one of the other service

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,040
mesh projects

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,079
out there and then we will dive

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
into istio we will talk about the

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,000
architecture of

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,800
istio and how do you install istio we

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,880
will have

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,680
a step-by-step guide from installation

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,919
to how do you actually onboarding an

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,800
application to istio

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,600
how do you do it gradually so you don't

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
have to

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
feel overwhelmed so you don't have to

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
like

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,240
learn a bunch of things up front so

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,960
you're focusing on

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,960
one small thing at a time how do you

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,560
onboarding your services

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,720
into istio to be able to observe

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
the services to be able to secure the

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,600
communications

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,759
among your services and be able to

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
control the traffic

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,440
as you start to develop more than one

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
version

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,960
of your micro services

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
so i want to quickly introduce all

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
applications

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,199
that we use in the book so we use

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,360
a trade application to do stock trades

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
if you're an investor you probably trade

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
stock at one point

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
so this is a really simple application

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
it'll essentially

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
allows you to like buy stocks at the

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,479
current

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,840
price to look at the portfolio

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,680
you know how much money you have to

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
query the external stock service

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
that runs outside of our kubernetes

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,520
cluster

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
to find out hey what is the today's

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,240
price

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,520
for a given company a stock

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,240
um a company like google amazon or ibm

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
so you get the most current price when

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,319
the market

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
is open or when the market is closed

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
it's the

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,600
price prior

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,440
it also uses a db2 services because we

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,560
are onboarding

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,080
these services to the mesh gradually

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,199
so we would be taking a look at

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,080
the the services in the stock trader

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
name space

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
we will be onboarding injecting cycles

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
to these services

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,160
and be able to talk about what we

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
learned

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
along this journey or yourself to

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
leveraging istio

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,479
to be able to using seo to

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,039
observe the connectivities of these

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:58,800
microservices

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,240
to look at the trace headers to

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,120
analyze you know how the timer spans

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
to secure the communications of the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
services

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,360
so we will talk about all these as we

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,280
learning to bring our application onto

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,120
istio

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,319
the key takeaway of the book is

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,599
service mesh strategy is

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
very important if you have micro

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,080
services

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
you need to decide whether you need uh

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,680
my

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,039
service mesh you need to decide

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
um you know what are the service mesh

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,080
composition you have

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,599
within your corporate and whether you

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,919
should have service mesh

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,759
a service mesh what is the service

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,039
measure fundamentally

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,319
really allows you to observe

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,160
secure and connect microservices and i

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,240
would add

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,080
consistently to this as well so

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
that's a fundamental thing you know

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
service mesh framework provides

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
you these capabilities so you don't have

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,440
to

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,639
solve these capabilities yourself

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,800
within your micro services

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,160
istio is fundamentally a service mesh

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,599
implementation it still is an open

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,639
source project

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,319
it's a mature and multi-vendor

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:32,000
open source implementations so istio

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,800
is pretty much ahead of

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
the competitors in this space i think

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
it's been

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
definitely one of the most popular open

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,760
source service mesh

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,120
implementations out there you can

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,040
gradually adopt to istio one feature

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,560
at a time so don't feel over

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,600
well overwhelmed different features of

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
istio as a user you don't have to

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
consume

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
all the features at once you really need

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,680
to look at the business

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,480
needs and adopt

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
issues based on your needs and i would

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,279
say

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,399
after helping so many users adopt istio

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
i would say probably secure

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,399
communications

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,360
is the easiest one to adapt to istio

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
because that's the only one that you

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
don't

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,959
actually require any changes to your

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
micro services

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,640
if you look at the other functions like

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
observe

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
it does require you to propagate trace

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
headers

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,440
if you want to observe distribute

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,720
tracing with your microservices

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,640
connect it also requires you to

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,680
make sure some of the trace head

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
the header base routing for instance it

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
does

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,680
require you to have that plane traffic

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,880
from your application container

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,079
so that the only proxy knows how to pass

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,279
that traffic

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,640
and use it to do intelligent decisions

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,640
um so it does require you sometimes

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
most of the times i would say to make a

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,040
little changes

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,680
to your microservices but

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,839
style is secure i would recommend which

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,880
is most of our users are doing

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,760
um to using istio to help you

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
secure microservices and then along the

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
way

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,680
you will be able to see observe as well

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
you will get

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
a lot of observability likely for free

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,640
without any changes

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
but some of the observability and

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
connect to microservice does require a

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,880
little bit more

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
changes of your code

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,760
so the book um this is the qr code that

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
you can also click on the book

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,160
link to get the book as part of our

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,519
cloud on ibm we also offer manage

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,240
istio if you're interested to not

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,079
running still upgrade is still yourself

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,839
if you're not interested in that

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,839
so having a vendor providing you a

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
managed issue for you would help you

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,560
simplify

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
to keeping up dated with the project

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
it's a lot of changes with the project

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,519
for sure

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,640
you can scan the qr from your phone

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,160
and you know open the cam open the photo

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
on the camera app it would show you the

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,920
link

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,320
to get registered uh for a book

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
basically we ask you just like the name

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
and um

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
and then then the email contact

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
information you'll be able to download

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,760
our book

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,320
and read this uh really short book um

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
uh it's it's definitely going to help

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,120
you if you are just

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,800
get started learning service mesh

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
so i think that's all i have uh yolanda

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,519
i would like to

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,920
uh see if there's any questions

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
thank you elena i ask in the chat if you

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
all had a question

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
and i don't see any at this time but i

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,320
would invite you for those of you who

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,519
are here

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,360
to open up your mic and ask lynn any

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,680
question you want to ask

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,440
we're at all things open 2020 and i know

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
you have a lot to ask

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
yeah yolanda thank you so much for

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,120
sending the book link

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
on the chat as well

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,639
and and if anyone is having any

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,399
difficulty with that link let me know

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,000
we'll be sure to help you out

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,560
so um lynn while we're waiting for

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,680
someone to ask us a question

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,560
um you talked about your experience um

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,399
at ibm as a master inventor can you talk

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,160
a little bit more about

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,079
uh what inspired you to write the book

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,680
um you know you mentioned that it's

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,680
short but any book that

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
uh expresses knowledge is a good thing

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
so i'm just curious what was your

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
motivation

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,079
yeah so i had a lot of struggle

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,560
actually when writing the book

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,160
so it still is actually a really really

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,279
popular topic

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
it's interesting that

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,360
before i was approached to write this

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,560
book

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,160
i was actually approached to write issue

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,560
book like multiple times right

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,519
and the reason i actually decided to

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,120
write this book

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,560
is because it's targeted to be

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,839
a really short book you know all of

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,600
us have our day jobs right which you

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,959
probably consume like 100 of your time

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,079
at work so who has bandwidth to

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,519
actually you know write another thing

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
right

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,040
so when i signed up to write the book i

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,440
was like wow it's a short book 75 pages

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,199
and i work on this project for three

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,839
years right

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,480
how could that be hard right you know

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
for my

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,399
three years expertise to build into a 75

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
pages book and i have a co-author right

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,279
so

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,079
i thought it wouldn't be that hard and

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,839
they had a really tight schedule on us

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,279
and certainly we didn't deliver on

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,279
schedule as things always panned out

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,360
because we want the book to be really

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,760
really good um

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
oh riley you guys if you are familiar

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
with already

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,560
if you ever publish your book with

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,920
already they actually have like

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,399
really high bars um for books

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,839
uh that you know they gone through like

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,920
three or even

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,560
ten plus revisions for editing

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,120
and so it's just like multiple editors

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,920
they also have like technical experts

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,199
they seek out like industry expert a

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,720
christian poster

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,279
for example um and burst out to uh

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,839
our technical reviewers and these two

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,680
guys they are the experts on

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
service matches and they also wrote

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
books about service manager and istio

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,360
out there

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,199
so they are the industry experts so they

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,399
provide reviews for a book

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,600
so it turned out to take a lot a lot

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,519
time that i had envisioned so we end up

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,639
actually doing a lot of like

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,279
weekends projects for the book as well

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,320
because and also we find out uh through

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,040
writing the book

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,480
is you know something you know

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,920
fundamentally so

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,000
well it's actually not so easy

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,800
to explain and translate that

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
to the readers so people can actually

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,560
get it

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,959
easily and we think the time they spend

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,560
like two hours on reading the book

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,480
so that turned out it's not so easy

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
and it's interesting you raise it if you

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
don't mind me jumping in because you do

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,639
have a question here

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,560
from mauricio i believe uh and that was

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
you talk about implementing security was

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,720
easy he wondered is there a demo

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,720
um that you could share

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,639
in working with the technology um

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
yeah so it's going to be a little bit

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,639
harder for me to put a demo

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,680
right here but if you guys are

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
interested i can certainly you know show

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
you how to

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,959
do that quickly um so let me

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,320
go ahead and share my screen if i can

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
find the window

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,800
so i'm still sharing my screen right yes

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,160
we can still see your screen

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,240
okay awesome so uh one thing i want to

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,839
uh so istio.io

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,959
is a wonderful resources out there

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,320
so if you go to our documentations one

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,320
thing i really like

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,959
is um that you can actually find out

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
tasks you can follow so when i say

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
secure microservices

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,919
is like authentications right

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,640
so if for instance i can secure my

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,839
microservices

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,839
through authentication policies

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
uh well we would allow

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,199
we would allow the the communication

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
of the mesh to go through right so for

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,839
instance

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,440
um i can specify like in my environment

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,280
here um since you guys ask for live demo

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
so i want to give you a warning you

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
might be asked for

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,080
failures as well

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,039
so this is my cluster and

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,880
i'm going to i'm going to deploy

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,919
book info on this cluster so that i can

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,320
show you guys

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:58,160
a live demo so we will do

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,360
book info platform

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,880
platform cube and

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,320
book and follow it did that nice

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,679
amazing interesting oh i was

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,919
at the wrong directory sorry so let me

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,320
see so while lynn is uh getting ready to

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,960
do her demo again i encourage you all to

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
ask a question um especially as the demo

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
is

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
being done if you would like for her to

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,480
answer them

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:31,679
we can get those to her and um

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,200
yeah so go ahead sorry

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,000
no no i was just following through with

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,440
my comments so it's you have the floor

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,679
okay um yeah thank you yolanda so i want

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
so you guys see i just deployed booking

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,720
for application

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,440
right so because my namespace

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
which is the default namespace have

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
issue

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,039
injection enabled

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,919
so i was able to deploy book info

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,840
and along the side it also deployed the

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,480
cycle proxy

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
for each of the booking for services

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,840
right

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
so in this example you can see you know

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,160
i have

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,960
two slash two hopefully coming up soon

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
so let's do a status check on these so

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
you can see

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,679
all of my booking for uh services are up

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,880
running now

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,000
right so in order for me

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
to access book info i'm going to access

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,440
through

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
israel gateways so what i'm going to do

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
next

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,039
is i'm just going to apply the gateway

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,559
resources

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,080
for this so what we are going to do

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,600
is we are going to do uh deploy booking

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,240
for gateway

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,240
which i will show you what it looks like

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
um so as you can see it's basically say

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,160
hey

00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,400
i want to expose port 80

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,960
http protocol and when the user reaches

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
out to

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,280
the gateway on port 80 you know if there

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,320
click on slash

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,280
product page or slash static all these

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
different

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,320
uh prefix or exact i want to route the

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,679
traffic to product page on 1980 right

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,000
so i know i haven't talked about

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,600
security yet i'm just getting

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,400
my application up running first

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,840
so what we are going to do next is make

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,679
sure you know i can

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,960
access book info through the gateway so

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,000
what we're going to do

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,440
is go to here

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,559
and slash product page by the way

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,559
the reason i'm showing here is because

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:50,159
this is my gateway and

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:54,240
this is my external ip of my gateway

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,559
and we are just clicking on the

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
uh the gateway ip so let me make sure

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
this is

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,600
the product page

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,840
okay so it's actually not uh reachable

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,600
so let's try to think out

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,159
what might be going wrong um

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,760
so i should have a booking for gateway

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
oh i know why it's wrong

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,679
so this is uh something interesting so

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,640
if you use

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,039
uh it's your cuddle analyzer no

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,120
validation issue so notice i have

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,520
another gateway here so i want to

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,320
check actually take a quick look to

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,559
check if

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,600
it is generating any conflict

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,280
so notice i'm also deployed port 80 on

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,320
this guy here too

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,400
so it's actually creating some conflict

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,960
with port 80 on the booking for gateway

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,760
so what i'm going to do is hopefully i

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,200
can delete this gateway

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,120
so it's called

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
so i'm going to delete this actually to

00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,760
be being gateway so that you would

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,039
reduce

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,360
uh conflict

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,360
so hopefully this is up running now

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,640
oh i have a secure connections let me

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,640
think that

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,159
let me check my authentication policy

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,000
[Music]

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,640
here

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
okay um i think i have some other

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,039
gateway deployed

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,039
so let me uh delete those two

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,480
because the other gateway also restricts

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,000
how um

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,840
let me check the service wow i told you

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
guys this is asking for trouble with

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,840
your

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,440
environment are not fully ready

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,360
well actually i appreciate the fact that

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,159
you were um

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,880
you're right on the spot of of offering

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
to do this

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
and i think that for the folks who are

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,080
in the room now

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,919
uh they might be learning a thing or two

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,640
so thank you

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,720
um lynn very much and if there's anyone

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,760
who joined uh in the middle of what

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
we're doing

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,000
uh lynn's son has just talked about her

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,640
book uh that she's written

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,600
and someone had asked for her to do a

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,880
demo

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,400
of the implementation of something so

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,360
um that's what you're experiencing right

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
now

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,080
yeah so i'm trying to you know clean up

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,600
my because this is a

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,400
i have a development cluster and this

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,480
cluster is running like the latest

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,039
um master code base right so it's not a

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,520
stable build as 1.7

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,760
and i also happen to deploy like a bunch

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
of stuff on my cluster for instance i

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
deploy

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
envoy filter on my cluster which is

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,080
alpha

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
feature because i need it for some other

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,640
purposes

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,039
so this is um i'm just

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,120
cleaning these up just making sure you

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:08,400
know things are okay so one thing about

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,919
istio is you could actually looking at

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,320
how your things are deployed um you can

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,120
actually look at all the resources so

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,440
i'm hoping it will be up running now

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,960
oh it did up running after i cleaned up

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,480
my cluster okay

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
um so you never know what's been causing

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
you

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,799
issues so now you can see my booking

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,400
phone is running

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,640
um so we expose on the gateway right

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
so i can reach the book info it's going

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,159
to do like wrong robbing between

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
three versions um by the way so when you

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
see no

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
review with any star so that's version

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,000
one

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,640
the red style is version three the black

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
is version two the black star is version

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,360
two so

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,679
so that's how you understand it's being

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
round robbing among different versions

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,159
right

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,240
so one thing we some of you ask is

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,760
okay you want to see authentication

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,799
policy to apply

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,840
mutual ts to the traffic right so what

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,880
we're going to do

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
is uh with so if i were you as a new

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
user

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
i mean this is what you would look at

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,440
and sometimes i look at them too because

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
i can't remember all these commands

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
either

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,520
so you will be looking at okay i want to

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,919
see you know do we have any awesome pure

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,840
authentication policy

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,080
in my system so which i have nothing

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,919
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,880
to globally enable

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
israel mutual tris in strict mode this

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
is pretty

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,200
brave i have to say this essentially

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,880
says

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,000
for any traffic going through the mesh

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,400
i want to be strictly mutual tis

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
by the way the reason the project that

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
have permissive

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,720
enabled by default is you know we want

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,919
to make sure your traffic can continue

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,039
uh flow with your applications

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,960
but if your security problem officer is

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,919
going to tell you you know i

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,120
want all the traffic to be securely

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,120
mutual ts this is what you do

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,520
normally i wouldn't recommend you to do

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,640
this i would recommend you to do this

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,640
per name space right so you would say

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,720
hey i want to default

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,799
apply this maybe just to one of your

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,600
name space first before you do it

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,799
globally

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,480
but since um you know we're doing

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,039
book info and i'm just

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
having my system mainly focused on this

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,080
demo

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,200
i'm just going to apply for everything

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,960
the reason you know

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
it's globally is because you are

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,520
deployed to the istio

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,520
system so that's the like the root

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,279
namespace so it would apply to

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
everything

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
so this essentially shows all the

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
traffic of book info

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,840
should be secure if it's not secure it's

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
just not going to work so what do you

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,200
think

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,320
might happen here you know

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,679
honestly we may get an arrow

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,520
actually we so everything is secure um

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,840
but um but it's only within the traffic

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
so

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,440
the other thing i want to highlight is

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,799
uh we're seeing the mesh

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,279
if you remember this uh um i guess it's

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,440
not in this talk um it's in the talk

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:29,600
i was just giving earlier um

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,440
that um we uh we we talked about

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,840
uh istio uh architecture so the the

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,720
istio architecture basically have

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:44,240
um let me find out that talk quickly

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:49,600
i think it's this one no okay

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,760
so um

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,279
okay so this diagram i just want to make

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,240
sure you guys understand

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,760
so what i have just done is enable

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
mutual tls

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,000
for all the services in the mesh

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,279
so that's just uh using this uh

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,440
command which says you know if it's not

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,200
mutual ts i'm not going to allow the

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,960
traffic going through it would

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,480
fail but what i haven't done is

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,799
you may be wondering you know this

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,080
traffic is not secure

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,360
end-to-end yet that is correct

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,799
right because um you have seen the not

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
secure here so i'm not going to

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,840
lie to you that's because um

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,640
end-to-end which would also involve to

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,520
secure the traffic

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,520
at the edge which is the ingress gateway

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,159
so what we haven't done

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,360
is secure the traffic at the edge which

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,559
you could also do

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,159
that too by creating update the gateway

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,679
resources

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,880
to add keys answers

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,480
for that but you get the idea so

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,799
essentially you know it's basically the

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
way

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:12,240
israel works is by policies you specify

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,039
policies uh as uh kubernetes yamaha file

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,720
and then you apply it using your cuba

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,760
cubecardo commands

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,000
and then istio control plane

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,320
is going to help you propagate that

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,240
configuration

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,559
to the cycloproxy and then the

00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,279
psychoproxy

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,919
is being programmed to do what you told

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,919
them to do

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,200
was that helpful i think from the

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,279
responses it was very helpful

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
uh and as a matter of fact mauricio

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
wanted you to know that his best

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,279
professors were the ones who were not

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,159
afraid to be wrong

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,440
or to not know the answer and indeed you

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,919
took i think this

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,880
audience through an example that worked

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,880
and

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,360
and they saw the process so i thank you

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,559
that was pretty doggone cool

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,960
uh for you to do well thanks so much

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,960
oh yeah

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,240
you made it so lynn can you talk about

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,720
do you have any future books uh that you

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,840
are

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,799
writing um and that might be

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,080
on the horizon for folks to look out for

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,279
oh that's a great question

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,000
not currently gosh i mean writing a book

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,279
like i said

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,640
it's like tremendous effort so i kind of

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,960
scaled down a little bit more um blogs

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,080
and conference speaking now because

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,880
that's something you know

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,320
it's containable within a week or two

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,840
prep time

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,480
so i i'm actually submitting

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
like i've been very active in speaking

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,960
i've been speaking about

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,919
service messages still hard

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,120
i've been speaking about you know istio

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,960
how we transition

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,360
from microservices to monolithic this

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,799
year

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,200
so that's interesting and the upcoming

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,120
kubecon and service mesh come going to

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,000
also speak about

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,000
still simplified beyond single class

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,000
brave enough to take another book

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,200
for the short time being will you be

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
speaking anymore

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,120
for all things open um after this

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,159
session

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,559
anymore today or tomorrow uh no

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,919
i would be hopefully done so i can go

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,360
back to my day job

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
as you can see yeah we have issue 1.8

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,279
coming up

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,679
i think before thanksgiving so we want

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,679
to

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,760
kind of tie that after at least get

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,200
ready for a user right before cube car

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
well again for those of you who might

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,679
have um come in

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,279
i see your note peter about the link not

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,840
opening i will check on that

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,760
and uh make sure that it's working

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,559
um and get that to you

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,240
but i also want to see um is there any

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,360
other questions that people might have

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,679
for lynn

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,840
while i go run and figure that out um

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,120
and then while i do that lynn

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,640
i'll ask you is there any um thing that

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,760
you want to challenge

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,880
this audience to think about

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,480
in the future of working with zeo and

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,760
having access to you to ask questions

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,159
yeah uh so just to uh before i get to

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,000
there

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,640
i just want to make sure you know the

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,240
book link i literally just click on it

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,320
so basically you can click on it you

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,679
would get to this link

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,320
um there's people having more troubles

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,159
beyond

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,399
the registration and download the book

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,559
for free uh so

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,760
peter if you can chat and let us know

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,799
what the issue is that you're having

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,440
that'll help me

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
and perhaps solve the problem that you

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,840
have

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,320
and if there's anyone else who's used

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
the ibm.biz link and it has

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,080
not given you trouble if you can let us

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,200
know that uh that'll help

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,720
uh us kind of break down and figure out

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,840
what's happening

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,840
i'm gonna go on the link as well okay

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,640
okay so uh

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
it's been loading for the last 10

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,559
minutes so it's taking a while to load

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,320
anyone else having any loading issues

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,640
with the

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,840
with the link don't worry we're going to

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,240
figure it out before the end of this

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
session

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,080
okay good so mauricio is working

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,559
christian is working for him

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,399
okay yeah it's working for me too i just

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,279
use my personal email

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,279
as you guys guys can see my my screen it

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,919
might be your browser you know

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,159
kind of like clear your cache here and

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,159
maybe using a different browser

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,519
well actually it looks like uh peter has

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,360
it working uh now

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,799
so it took him directly to the page i

00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
know yes and if

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,320
there's anyone else who's having a

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,039
problem let us know because

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,279
part of again you joining us today and

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,079
listening to lynn is that you get access

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,599
to her book

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
and we want to make sure that you do get

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,560
that so

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,040
great yeah that that's great i'm glad it

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
works

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,760
so yeah yolanda back to your question

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,639
you know i would challenge you

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
if you have micro services uh in your

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,720
organization

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,119
i would challenge you to definitely you

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,919
know

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,800
learn about service mesh uh just to

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,000
understand

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,000
you know what's out there why is this a

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,200
hot thing out there like service

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,440
measures generated

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,440
like

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:49,839
the year of 2019

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,839
it's like service

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,639
you want to understand you know is this

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,359
something relevant to you

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,320
is this something you should be looking

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,880
into

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,400
is this something that could potentially

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,800
help your organization to run more

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,920
effectively

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,640
and maybe even save a cost right

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
because i actually got user asking me

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,920
you know

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,480
hey you know the psycho proxy are you

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,480
worried about the performance impact

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,400
and the resource constraints with the

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,640
cycle proxy

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
that's one way to look at it but the

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,440
other way to look at it is

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,800
i mean you're leveraging the best of

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,079
open source project envoy to do your

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,200
psycho proxy

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,599
do you actually think that actually is

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,560
not

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,200
comparable to developer writing their

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
own ways to connect secure and manage

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,520
their microservices

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,200
and also writing their own ways for

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,839
different languages

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,920
so think about that you know how much

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,040
brain power you are leveraging

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,400
using the most popular proxy such as

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,280
envoy to mediate your traffic so i want

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,640
to challenge

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,680
you to learn more about uh service mesh

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,040
you know to have hands-on to play with

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,599
one of the service mesh

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,040
projects certainly if you follow my book

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,640
it would be istio

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
it would be you know looking at

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,920
understanding why so many people are

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,560
talking about

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,640
it you know how does this really help

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,839
potentially help you

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,960
and your organizations to standardize

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,920
things to help your services to

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,320
communicate consistently to apply

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,119
policies like what i've shown

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,599
you know you could be a lot easier was

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,480
trust

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,400
each developer to do their own thing

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,160
so um i have a question that has come up

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,599
and that is how long is that link going

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,160
to be available is it

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,119
complements of ibm forever or is there a

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
certain period of time we're going to

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,240
cut it off

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,280
oh that's a great question you know i

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,839
think the link

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
is going to be available for a long time

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,079
at least

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,240
to my understanding so it's definitely

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,280
available throughout the conference i

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,440
would say

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,800
probably throughout you know the end of

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
this year for sure

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
you know i have no idea how long it

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,720
would last so definitely

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,440
go get it while it's still out there

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,800
yeah hit the download button

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
so here's another question if someone

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
wants to get your autograph how would

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
they do that

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,440
yeah i wish it would be easy you know i

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,400
wish there is

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
like a physical place you know we can

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,119
shake hands

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
you know to be able to write something

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,800
you know that's something

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,079
we haven't figured out how to solve it

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,480
with covid

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,560
you know maybe next year definitely if

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
you have the book i'd be happy to

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,119
uh probably go to the next cubecon when

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,200
we actually can physically meet

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,520
we're also discussing about eastfield

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
con so whenever the next conference

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,359
about

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,280
service measure kubernetes or istio i'll

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,200
be most likely to be there

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,720
and hopefully we'll be able to meet you

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,119
one day

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,880
nice so ladies and gentlemen you are at

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,680
the all things open 2020

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,000
um book signing session with uh lynn son

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
and

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,560
she's talking about it's you explained

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,079
we have about seven minutes or so left

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,720
before uh lenny gets to go back to her

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,760
life

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,599
uh at ibm and so i want to just

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,240
again offer to you the opportunity to

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,480
ask any questions that you might have

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,280
based on all the wonderful information

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,480
she shared so far especially the demo

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,920
and and again

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,280
thank you so far for those of you who

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,560
have been giving us comments we

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,920
appreciate it

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,359
very much um and

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,400
um yeah so uh and then what i want you

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,880
to do

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,079
um is when you leave and you go to your

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
next sessions i want you to tell

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,040
everyone about lynn

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,599
and your session and how wonderful this

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,680
was for you and um

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,839
and share the link because knowledge is

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,200
power and this is great information that

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,160
she shared so we're not

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
we're not quite gone yet for those of

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,280
you who are still here

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,800
but i do just want to just reiterate

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,079
that we appreciate you all attending the

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,359
conference today

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,880
and that ibm is very proud of lynn

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,880
and the work that she's doing and

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,800
and we're offering her to you right in

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,210
this moment to give us everything you'd

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,760
like to know about lynn

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,240
[Laughter]

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
and it's

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,839
any chatting any questions

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,520
all right so uh while we're in our last

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,280
few minutes lynn

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,560
um there is a question that has just

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,640
come in it is

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,000
um i don't know if you can see it as

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,359
well i can read it aloud for those who

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
might not be able to see it is there any

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,960
performance concerns with proxying all

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,680
the traffic to and from

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,599
each microservice through a sidecar

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,160
container

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,680
yeah so that's a great question so i was

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,240
actually just

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
stopped sharing my screen but i'm going

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,800
to go

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
ahead share my screen one more time

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,800
okay so yeah definitely they are

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,839
performance concerns i mean

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,040
it's a very legitimate questions

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,520
right so the issue team actually started

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,240
uh i want to learn this search button

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,280
here

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,599
so i use it a lot so um

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,160
so we actually publish uh performance

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,280
data for every single release like this

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,280
performance data

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
is right on 1.7 right so we actually do

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,880
our load testing so we will tell you

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,119
during the load

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,880
like we have a thousand services with

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,760
2000 cycads

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
and there's like 70k mesh wide requests

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,560
per second

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,040
and when we run that with the latest

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,079
issue 1.7.3

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,920
we would tell you you know how much

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,800
cpu and memory i use uh per request per

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,240
seconds

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,839
and how much envoy is adding to

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,640
the 90 latency so we would also tell you

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,480
like the control plane performances uh

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,560
if you have a lot of

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,560
services we do recommend you use

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,839
namespace isolations

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,880
so that your configuration are not

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,319
propagated across all the namespaces i

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,960
think i mentioned the envoy

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,680
configuration are non-trivial it's like

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,200
thousands and thousands of lines so if

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,599
you have a lot of services

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
you want to make sure you're scoping

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,359
your

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,040
configuration precisely to the namespace

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,560
that needs that configuration

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,640
so so we have all that data and we have

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
the data on the latencies

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,760
like in this example we would show you

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,720
you know how much are the latencies and

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,359
we really measure in many seconds here

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,960
right

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,359
so the latency normally is acceptable

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,880
for most of the user unless you are

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,960
really you know

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,240
you can't tolerate like a few

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,720
milliseconds of

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,599
delay but the on the other hand i would

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,839
challenge you

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,800
right if you're not spending that time

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,960
in proxy

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,240
to do this work that service mesh is

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,800
providing for you

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,560
you have to do equivalent work in your

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,200
application container too

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
so when you look at the latency and

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,319
performance concern

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,920
you have to look at both folder you

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,200
can't just simply look at

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,240
okay istio or any service mesh proxy

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,400
you are introducing this much latency

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
that's not apple to apple comparison

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,520
because

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,680
we're actually reducing for your

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,839
application to solve these problems

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,599
because we solve it in epoxy for you

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,480
right so you have to look at

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,640
okay if i'm not using proxy if i'm

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,520
actually doing this in my application

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,079
container

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,800
you know what are the latency what other

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,680
cpu and memory i would be getting

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,319
to really comparing this um the

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,839
functionality

00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,839
