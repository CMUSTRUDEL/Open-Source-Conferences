Abstract: Data Integration Lifecycle Management - or DILM - is challenging regardless of your chosen data integration platform. The primary goal of this session is an explanation - via demonstration - of the production release of an SSIS Project. We will walk this project through lifecycle management using Azure DevOps - from initial development, through testing, to production.
