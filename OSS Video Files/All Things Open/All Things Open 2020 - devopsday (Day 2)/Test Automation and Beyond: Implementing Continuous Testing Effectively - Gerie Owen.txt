Presented at All Things Open 2020 - devopsday (Day 2)

Abstract: Continuous testing is one of the most effective ways of building quality into the continuous delivery pipeline; yet it is difficult to implement in practice. It involves more than test automation. Although test automation is a must; continuous risk analysis and optimizing the test suite is critical so that the automated suites doesn’t become a bottleneck in the continuous integration pipeline. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to implement an effective continuous test strategy throughout the continuous delivery pipeline. We’ll look at real life examples of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll learn how to optimize test scope, test cases and test suites to create effective and efficient test automation. We’ll explore practices such as

- advanced analytics,
- environment access and availability,
- service virtualization,
- and data management and learn how to use them to enhance your continuous testing strategy.

Finally, you’ll learn the importance of implementing production monitoring including automated test triggers, service health monitoring, test result monitoring and root cause identification. Attendees take home a clear understanding of how to plan and implement a successful continuous testing approach.

hello

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,599
um i'm gerry owen i'm a test strategist

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,040
test evangelist i'm also a senior test

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
manager now

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
at medulla and their test uh qe

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
architect

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480
i speak and write at a lot of

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,760
conferences and i'm really happy to be

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,519
here today at

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,519
devops days rally so let's go ahead and

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
peter sometimes does this presentation

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,439
with me

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,480
um so the agenda here is we'll talk a

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
little bit about what digital

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
transformation

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,520
is um we'll talk about the synergies

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
between digital transformation and

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
devops and there were quite a few of

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
them

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,879
um then we'll talk about how to enable

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
digital transformation through

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,200
continuous delivery

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,440
and then finally talk a little bit um

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,239
about a test strategy for continuous

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
testing and

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
you know that will will depend on how

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,199
much time we have at the end

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,160
so what is um what is a digital

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,480
transformation

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
well you know it means a lot of things

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
to a lot of people

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,760
but basically it's a fundamental shift

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
in the way an organization approaches

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,680
its business and operational processes

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
by using technology

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
to increase the focus on and improve

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
customer experience

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
which increases business value now

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
what's the big part of that

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
the most important part of that is not

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,439
technology

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,880
it's customer it's enabling customer

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,759
experience

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
through technology so that's that's what

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
a digital

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,840
digital transformation is all about um

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
so the focuses of a digital

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,680
transformation

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,720
um versus devops you know this little

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
bit different

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
so a digital transit transformation as

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
we just mentioned

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
it uses technological innovation to

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,360
increase the business value

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,640
by enhancing the customer experience and

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,040
it also streamlines

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
operational processes and business

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,280
models and methodologies

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,200
so now devops on the other hand

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,720
enables innovation through technology

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
and operations

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
increases business value by enhancing

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
customer experience

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
and also streamlines process and

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,239
eliminates bottlenecks

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
so you can see there's this energy right

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
there so

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,160
that would suggest that um to have a

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
real

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,599
successful digital transformation you

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
really need devops

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,720
synergies more specifically

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
um that if you look at the devops

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
principles that are described in the

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,080
three ways

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
you have systems thinking amplifying

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
feedback loops

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,599
and creating a custom a culture of

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,560
experimentation through continued

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,879
learning

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,400
right so what we can see here

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,599
is that these are the same principles

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
that would be used to create any kind of

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,120
a major change

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
and and that's the other thing about a

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,319
digital transformation

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,120
or any transformation for that matter

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,840
it's a big change and it's not only a

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
change

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,680
in technology and process

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
and methodology but it's a change in

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
focus

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,840
it's it's a change in using technology

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,159
to create customer experience it's

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,480
focusing on customer experience

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
and and and that's what what devops is

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,319
about too

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,920
it is is increasing business value

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,080
business value not

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
not necessarily technology value but

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,280
using

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,360
business value to using technology to

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,159
improve business value

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,000
so what's more of the synergies well

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,360
let's look at them a little deeper

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,480
so what's systems thinking well it's

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
focusing

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,080
on the performance of entire process and

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
it's the most effective and it's the

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
most effective approach to transforming

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,720
business models and operating

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,799
operational processes so when you when

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
you you do fit when you do real systems

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
thinking you

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,160
you dig down you ask the five why's

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and and you look at why how

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,280
and and find where the issues are

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
and meld them together in a smooth

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
process

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
um and this and this eliminates the

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
silos between i.t

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,320
and business operations so

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
if you have if you make changes in a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,240
digital transformation

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
if you make changes just to the

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
operating model

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,199
or just to the technology model it's

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
going to fail

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
it needs to the system's thinking brings

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
those changes together

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
and that enables the fundamental shift

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,360
in the business workflows

00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,880
also in the mindset

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,160
so the next synergy

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,039
amplifying feedback loops now we know

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,639
that's that

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,520
is that is a basic tenet of devops

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,320
um it's how it's how we make the

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,280
continuous

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,360
pipeline run smoothly right we amplify

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,199
the feedback loops we get early feedback

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
immediate feedback

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
but that's also critical to a digital

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,800
transformation

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,919
so the corrections can be made early and

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,919
often

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,720
um then there's there's also focusing on

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,880
responsive effective and efficient

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,240
customer service to all the internal and

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
external customers

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
and again that's that's that's that's

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
what

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,919
devops that's what devops is about too

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,120
right um

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,160
so then another synergy is creating a

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,280
culture of ex continuous experimentation

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
and learning devops is about fail fast

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
right

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
try things try things if they don't work

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
move on try something else

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
it encourages innovation without the

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,440
fear of consequences

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,880
it but new processes may not always work

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
technology approaches sometimes fail but

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
if we really take the lit the risks and

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,199
push the limits that's what leads to

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,800
true groundbreaking innovation

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,800
and if we don't have that

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,840
if we don't have the groundbreaking in

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
innovation

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
taking a whole different mindset and

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
approach

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,319
we're not going to have a successful

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,360
transformation

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
transformations involve something

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,840
different they involve

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,199
innovation that's that's that is a true

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
innovation

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
that's not just you know the kind of the

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,520
difference between innovation

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,840
and and um

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
and just doing something a little

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
differently

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
is that true innovation takes all kinds

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
of

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
takes all kinds of different thoughts

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,880
puts them all together

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
um and and comes up with something new

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,360
um

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,880
uh johansen um

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,080
brought this out he um developed

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,440
a theory on on that if you put together

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,800
people from all different fields you can

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,840
you can bring about change that is not

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
well this is what we did last time and

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,880
okay so now we're going to go in this

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,400
direction it's not

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,479
chain it's not basing it's not basing

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,440
innovation off of

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,120
your previous baseline it's it's it's

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,039
taking a completely new

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,960
direction so

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,400
here's kind of what i see it in in um

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,680
you know in a in a pictorial

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,879
um way you know so you've got

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,879
you've got your business value right

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,319
your business value focus your customer

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
centric focus

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,160
um within that you have your tenants of

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,199
systems thinking

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,280
leading continuous learning and

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,160
amplifying feedback loops

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
and then when you get into you get in

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,560
there

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,759
you've got your your whole ideation plan

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,360
deliver

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,039
implement monitor test do you know it's

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
a continuous circle

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,039
and that's that's where devops is so

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
if so you can kind of look at it this

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,919
way

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:37,519
um devops sits within

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,519
the digital transformation

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,160
okay so

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,480
now in order to have a digital

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,399
transformation continuous delivery um

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,000
continuous integration you have to have

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,800
continuous testing um and and

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,959
this this the the thing about continuous

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
testing is it focuses on quality at

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
every stage in the continuous delivery

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
process

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,839
and quality is the core

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,240
of a customer-centric focus um

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
we we manage the risk by increasing the

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
effectively of our test processes and of

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
course

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
assessing and mitigating risk is is the

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,080
primary goal

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,839
continuous testing is is very

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,680
critical because you know as testers and

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
i'm a tester

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
i don't know how many other testers we

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,399
have out in the audience but

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
um you know when you think about it who

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,320
is responsible

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
for quality in my other presentation

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
there

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,839
um i i ask

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
i usually ask at the beginning of the

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,519
presentation for a show of hands

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,320
how many people how many of you are

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,160
developers how many are are our

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,040
operations folks how many

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,680
are systems analysts how many of you are

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,519
responsible for quality

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,959
well usually at the i'll ask the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
question at the beginning

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,760
and i'll get a show of hands usually

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,040
mostly the testers raise their hand

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,440
um but at the end what what i try to

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,839
show

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
is that we are all responsible for

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
quality

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,680
and in a digital transformation that's

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,279
that's that's even more critical

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,640
because our um you know a

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,360
as as we have to as testers be the

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,160
guardians of the company's reputation

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,920
and the way we do that is being the

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,279
champion of the customer

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,959
so in a way we also have to enable

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
digital transfer

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,680
digital transformation through

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,040
continuous testing

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,720
so how do we do that well

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,880
um we we want to look at establishing a

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
safety net that helps the devops team

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
protect the user experience

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
that's that's the auto the early

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,160
feedback

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,680
the automation um

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,000
having stable test environments um

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,000
integrating seamlessly in the software

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,640
delivery pipeline and then and the

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,399
devops tool chain i mean i i don't see

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
really how you can have devops without

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
continuous testing

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
and that delivers the actionable

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
feedback that's appropriate for every

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
stage

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,640
in the pipeline it's something new

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,720
you know we're not testing at the end of

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,720
each sprint anymore or

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
the old waterfall testing after

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
development

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,320
this is it's a transformation and

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
and the customer focus enables the

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,839
digital transformation

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
so what are the components of the test

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,279
strategy

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,560
well we need to streamline the test

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,800
processes

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,959
we need to champion team responsibility

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
for quality and that's that's probably

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,079
the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
most important one we need to increase

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,880
velocity and improve quality

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,240
test throughout the build and delivery

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
pipeline

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,399
implement the automated checkpoints

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,959
shift left in both

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,160
functional and non-functional and shift

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,000
right

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,760
implement by implementing continuous

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,040
monitoring and testing and production

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,320
so how do we increase the

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,720
effectiveness of our test processes well

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
the main part of that is optimizing that

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
you know everybody says oh test

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,880
automation

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,079
yes but before you can automate your

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,959
tests

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,600
you should optimize your tests otherwise

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,320
you know

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
like some of my clients i i had i had

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
one organization and

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,600
they were moving from agile to devops

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
they had a regression suite

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
an automated regression suite that ran

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,920
two weeks

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
that's not going to work you need to

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
make sure that the tests are

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,760
and you need to optimize the test cases

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,920
you need to make sure they're

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
functioning and they're on focusing on

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
the

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
functionality they're validating they

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
need to be simple because the more

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
complex the test the more

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
effort you're going to have to validate

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,160
the script itself

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
um and and even though you can use

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
service virtualization to fill in for

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,680
missing components which

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
a lot of times we do try to keep the

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,160
tests

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,680
as independent as possible now

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,120
optimizing the test suites well

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,600
when you're putting together a

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,000
regression test selection

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,320
the first thing you've got to realize is

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,199
it's an ongoing process

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,839
you can't have a big automation effort

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,160
okay

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,120
good we're done well with devops

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,440
and with digital transformation we're

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720
taking we're taking feedback from the

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,959
customer right

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,720
we're seeing what's working and what's

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,920
not we're taking our feedback from the

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
customer

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,279
and updating our workflows our our

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
our features accordingly so when you've

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,199
got continuous

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
delivery you can your features are going

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,480
to be continuously changing

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
so you have to keep updating your

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
regression suite you need to

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
you need to track how the tests are

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,920
functioning we need to do cleanup

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
analyze the metrics are they really

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,760
hitting what we need to test

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
are we getting defects in production and

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
it just continues

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,800
so we want to make sure that we include

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
the test cases that validate the high

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,720
risk areas of the code

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,279
we need to include test cases that

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,600
validate customer centric features again

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,600
customer we need to validate the

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,560
critical business workflows and those

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,079
those may very well be changing in a

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
digital transformation

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,120
so there again we need to be ready to

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,519
change and

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
it also helps to use functional

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,959
automation tools that we can create

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
multi-purpose scripts

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,480
we need to be able to run across

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,560
platforms and browsers

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,600
we need to we can even sometimes gather

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,560
some of our performance

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,680
information with our our automated tests

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,639
now just a couple of things about the

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,839
automated tests running um it's helpful

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,880
to run them in parallel

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,880
we want to make sure that autonomous

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,560
that they don't rely on the previous

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,920
results of other tests

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,160
we want to keep them quick running um

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,320
and for the most part each test should

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,800
create and delete its own data

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
um unless you know we're when we're

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,959
testing

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,560
workflows then we may have to

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,920
but for the most part um we need to keep

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,199
the test so that

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,639
um it's not going to leave data in the

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,440
state that will need to be cleaned up

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,199
afterwards

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,279
because that would that would hinder our

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
our continuous it would create a

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,839
bottleneck and

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,959
hinder our continuous foot

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,680
so talking about bottlenecks well you

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
know

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,199
we have to identify the bottlenecks and

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
because what they imp they impede

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
velocity

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
and in a digital transformation again

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,000
things move fast

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,959
um and and and again just like

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,519
updating your test automation mitigating

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,759
bottlenecks is an ongoing process

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
you need to look at the you need to

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
identify them

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
figure out the consequences manage them

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,959
critical thinking

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:38,720
and prevent future bottlenecks

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,959
so we can increase velocity

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
by shifting left we want to push

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
automation to the base of the test

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
pyramid

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,120
use tdd bdd pair developers with testers

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,959
um you know as as much as we want to

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
automate everything we can't automate

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,320
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
there's still there's still manual and

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
exploratory testing

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
that needs to be done because that's the

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,920
way you find a lot of your

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,679
your usability issues and again in a

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,799
digital transformation when you're

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,160
relying

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,520
on all the diff all the digital channels

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,520
for your customers um if

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,319
if you have usability issues they're

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,839
going they're going to your competitor

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,280
you know if if i can't if i can't uh

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,959
put my uh new jeans in into the

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,960
into the shopping cart and check out

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
easily i'm going to get them at a

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,799
different website

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,440
you know um and ampli amplifying the

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,760
feedback

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
the automated feedback loops enables

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,320
risk-based decision-making and again

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,400
risk-based decision-making is critical

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,280
in digital transformation

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
you need to make decisions based on

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,320
what's going to work best for the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
customer but you need to do it quick

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,840
so how do we improve quality well the

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,840
whole team needs to take responsibility

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,360
developers need to embrace testing yeah

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
they don't like it

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,679
but if they kind of learn that it if

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,840
they can see what's in it for them that

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,480
they'll be fewer defects coming back at

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,120
them

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
i was in a meeting this morning um

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,080
working on

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,400
implementing some unit testing procedure

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
plans and well you know we'll have to

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
try it out and see

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
see what it does to our velocity in the

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,919
sprint

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,799
if and i'm like well okay then that

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
the attack man is just like well it's

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,120
going to slow him down

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
yeah but we may pick up speed on the

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,360
other end

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,320
so you know you everybody has to be on

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,559
board to

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,559
embrace embrace quality

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,440
so how do we implement this through the

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,720
pipeline

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,520
well we implement

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
automated tests in each stage so we want

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,919
to build

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,799
into we want integration code analysis

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
assemble the distribution push the

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
binaries

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,360
um you know we we need to the only thing

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,799
that gets triggered manually in this

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,120
whole process

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,919
is your uat and your deployment to

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
production

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
and when you finally get to continuous

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,760
delivery

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,240
even that gets automated so

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,280
implementing the checkpoints we need

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,480
unit tests to

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,760
verify code the key the component test

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,760
should be verifying the key features um

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
we don't get to the automated regression

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,480
tests until we get to

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,559
right before the deployment um and and

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
that should be fine as long as we've

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,880
we've

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,280
we've done all of our base testing

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
um you know the the other thing that we

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,280
have to look at

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,640
is is what type of a business are we in

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,520
are we in a a in a

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,440
medical field where a software device

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
can potentially kill somebody

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
if it's not tested well enough or an

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,480
automated

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,480
or a driverless car well

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
then we need to make sure we're doing

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
heavy testing

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
but if we're in an organization that

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
that's that's coming out with a whole

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,760
new product

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,280
and there's competitors also maybe we

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
need to be first to market

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
we have to understand our business

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
that's the business the organizational

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,520
part of the transformation

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,559
we need to understand that and and plan

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,559
accordingly

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:40,000
with risk so you know we can

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,120
we definitely want to shift left we need

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,760
we need everybody involved early

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
automate embrace the test automation

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,159
period

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
and even the non-functional you know

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,440
it's important really to to get the

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,000
non-functional um performance testing

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,440
and security testing in there because

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,679
um design flaws most of the bugs

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,600
are design flaws and of course if that

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
gets toward the end of the pipeline then

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
you're

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,520
you're you're going to have a big

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
bottleneck because it's

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
more time and more money to correct

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,679
those

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,559
uh finally your continuous monitoring

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,080
and intestine production this this of

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,039
course comes from the principle of

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,159
amplifying p

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,440
feedback loops um but it gives you it

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
also it gives you the

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,320
enables collecting an analog and

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,400
analyzing data and metrics

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,600
to optimize the customer experience and

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,919
especially when you're

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,440
doing a digital transformation you're

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,640
offering your customers

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,200
new digital channels um you really need

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,280
that metric so you can correct things if

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
it didn't work out quite the way you you

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,480
anticipated

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,039
um basically again it's it's it is it's

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,039
all about

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,960
it's all about the customer and and

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,760
having that kind of data

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
allows the the dev op teams and the

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
stakeholders to

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
to make adjustments

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
and you know some of the testing and

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,120
production that we can do

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,840
is monitoring data and transactions

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,039
simulating transactions maybe even a b

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,760
testing

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,559
experimentation with friendly users all

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,280
of that gives

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,280
especially in a digital transformation

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,600
getting the users involved early

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,840
gives us the information that we need to

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,760
make it successful

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:31,440
so i think we're just about there

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,679
um so the the devops principles can be

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,039
the basis for creating the major changes

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,480
that are required for digital

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,240
transformation

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,080
our synergies are found in the three

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,880
ways systems thinking

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,039
amplifying feedback loops and creating a

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,960
culture of continuous experimentation

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,600
and learning

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,760
enabling digital transformation through

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
continuous delivery involves applying

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,919
the synergistic focuses of digital

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,039
transformation

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
and devops across the pipeline and

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
finally

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,039
continuous testing enables digital

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
transformation

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,520
throughout the continuous delivery

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,360
pipeline by ensuring a customer-centric

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,440
focus

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,799
so have a few little

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,919
references here and

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,960
i have really really enjoyed being here

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,240
with you

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,520
and if there are any questions

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,520
i'm happy to take them now

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,919
all right thanks jerry um looks like we

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,080
do have a little bit of q a

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,720
here um trying to figure out how to get

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,440
back to uh

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,440
well maybe i need an escape right to ah

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
there we go

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,880
you can look around you can look at

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,679
these in the q a if you want to or i'll

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,640
just go ahead and

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,360
pose the first question from you uh jean

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
marcel

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,799
asks what do you think of tools like

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
test rail

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,840
uh so jay do you have any experience

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,360
with between testing

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,200
test rail oh boy

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,720
sounds like the answer is yes so go for

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,000
it yeah you know

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,559
um i think i

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,880
yeah it's it's it's a it's a good tool

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
there are tons of test management tools

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,799
out there

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,640
and and i think it's important to have a

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,679
test management tool

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,520
because a lot of well like jira um if

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,159
you're using jira

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,600
you need you don't have the

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,520
functionality

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,080
within um within jira itself

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,200
to manage your testing manage your test

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,159
cases get your execution metrics

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,559
and so jira they there's all kind all of

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
your

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,960
test tools including test rail they all

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,159
have a jira plug-in so

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,240
um i would say you know if you want to

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,480
um you know if you're using jira

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,520
definitely get a plug in

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,240
the one tool that i've noticed um that

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,440
rally actually has a pretty good test

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,679
management

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,159
um in in it but yeah i think it's

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,159
it you do need you do need a test

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,400
management tool

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,360
and you know depending on what you're

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,960
actually you know

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
if you're going to evaluate test

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
management tools the way i always start

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,039
doing that

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
is is by looking at your requirements

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,640
first figure out what do you need what

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,799
do you need it to integrate with

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
um what what are you trying to achieve

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,080
with it how many users are you going to

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,440
have

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,360
so that you can look at the different

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,919
pricing models and whatnot

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,520
but you know i i've seen people oh

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,080
they're gonna we're gonna use test rail

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:52,080
we're gonna use we're gonna use uh uh um

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,919
alm um they they grab a tool before

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,520
analyzing their requirements so

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,000
definitely look at your requirements

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,919
before you select a tool

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
all right excellent thanks jerry now

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
we've had several people uh

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
very interested in your references which

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,279
weren't up for very long so uh

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,880
while we uh we have a couple other

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
questions but could you would you mind

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
jerry to share your

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
reference slide again we had several

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,200
people ask if you could

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,440
uh post that up again so they could get

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
along

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,919
[Music]

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,799
there we go so but i'm gonna

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,240
i'm not gonna be able to read okay i'm

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,960
not gonna be able to read the questions

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
now

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,760
so that's okay no worries i can i can

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,360
kind of moderate through the questions

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
if you don't mind all right

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,799
yeah so our next question comes from

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,720
brandon who says

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,720
my team is constantly struggling with

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,039
defining integration tests

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,000
should we mock out external services hit

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
the real thing

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,520
what if the external service is

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
unreliable in qa which causes our tests

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,240
to be unreliable

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,760
any advice around these sorts of

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,400
problems yeah you know i i think

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,840
it it it and integration testing is

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,559
always a challenge

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,480
um if it's it's always best to use the

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,600
real thing but i think if you can

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,880
again you know shift left um yeah

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,159
knock out the services uh use service

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
virtualization

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,520
if you need spin-up environments um the

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
the the

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,440
you know okay there is going to be some

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,240
unreliability but you need to balance

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,360
that

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,320
against um the early feedback that you

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,240
really need with

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,480
with devops uh aim into that

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,679
uh excellent uh appreciate that and then

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,720
we have

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,679
one more question here in the chat uh

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,559
javier asks a few tools such as blaze

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,600
meter

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,520
an open source tool and smart bear have

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,360
that are focused on continuous testing

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,760
do you have any other suggestions

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,120
for continuous testing tools well you

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,200
know you can

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,279
you can really use whatever um

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,120
whatever tools you want i mean i think

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,520
you know pretty much

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,200
most of the vendors now are are trying

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,880
to gear their tools

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:11,440
um to a light touch again make sure

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,840
you you're you're integrating your your

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,200
your before you choose a tool figure out

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,960
what you're integrating with

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,799
figure out what you want to get out of

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,480
it how do you you know how do you

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,039
what specifically are you trying to do

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,640
with the tool um you know is are you

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
looking for a test management tool or

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,240
you're looking for your

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,360
you know you you may want to look at

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
something that

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,799
would you can use you can create both

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,640
your some of your

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,080
performance scripts as you're creating

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,120
your automation scripts

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,520
again you know you're trying to

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,960
streamline so

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,520
yeah i mean uh

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
they're all all the tools are good but

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,000
the one that's right for you is the one

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,640
that meets your requirements

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,520
uh yeah great answer it's a tool is

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,760
really

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,520
a tool does what the the end of the tool

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,600
holder does with it

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,520
exactly that's really what you what you

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,279
need to achieve with your tests

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
uh and really i'd say more importantly

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,279
the um

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,440
just meeting the requirement of the need

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,840
for continuous testing which you can

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,720
you know really use any number of tools

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,720
for

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,480
it doesn't have to be a cots or

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
off-the-shelf tool either i'd just

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,240
add that i mean you know there may be

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,840
something you have that uh

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,320
you know you can roll your own or

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,320
whatever but uh

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,000
great answer all right we have uh

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,520
another question or two here we have

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,159
just one or two more minutes for

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
questions

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,640
uh michael asks we have a 10 year old

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,960
product with 15 year old code and zero

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,320
automated tests there's pressure for a

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,320
complete rewrite

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,559
can you suggest how to put pinning tests

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,840
or characterization tests around

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,520
legacy code to do testing against new

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,120
quote unquote rewrite well there again

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,240
i think what you need to do is is is

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,960
focus on the customer um you know what

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,640
what

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,720
how is the rewrite going to happen

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,000
understand that understand the

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,840
the background of it um you know what

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,559
what is are your workflows going to

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,159
change are you going are you rewriting

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,440
it or are you going to use a sas

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,200
tool um you know

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,799
you have to look at the requirements to

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,840
figure out how you're going to plan your

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,799
tests

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,640
um around it um i think i think one of

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,240
the other speakers wanted to

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,600
say something on that one too i thought

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,600
i saw something pop up here

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,039
is that michael there i'm noticing uh

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,200
yeah the magic bullet thinking is that

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,799
we'll have magically created tests on

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,159
new code despite every

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,760
yeah um that

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,640
yeah that that can happen um

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,640
but um

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
you want to just again when when you you

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,600
know whatever code

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,279
whatever whether it's legacy code that

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,320
you're rewriting whether it's

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,240
something totally new you want to focus

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,799
your testing on the critical

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,760
functionality the code the most complex

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,960
code

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,480
and the and

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,600
the customer how do you break magical

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,679
thinking oh wow

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,440
well um yeah training is helpful dojos

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,960
are good because you get that that

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,399
collaboration

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,640
um you know if you can look at it

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,640
history repeats itself so if you can

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,600
find some history

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,360
that you can show has um you know

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,760
history of some of the other projects

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,279
that you can show that magical thinking

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,000
caused disaster um that's that's a good

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,000
way to to

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
bring some you know into it

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,880
yeah um and you know

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,480
there again too you've got all your um

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,840
you know your

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,960
your uh um heuristics the

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:10,080
biases the planning fallacy and all that

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,080
so you want to try to you know avoid

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,960
those

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,960
