Presented at All Things Open 2020 - devopsday (Day 2)

Abstract: From the start, security has been a key priority for technology professionals who practice the grassroots principles of DevOps. However, even on teams which strive to adhere to DevOps practices, security concerns still take a back seat far too often. The more recent DevSecOps phenomenon does not represent a new idea (secure all the things!) but it does represent a renewed focus on the importance of security in the development lifecycle and its implications for all of downstream IT.

This session is for practitioners who want to understand and improve their ability to “shift left” in IT security. We will focus on the principles, processes, and technical skills necessary to make security and risk profiling a front-end priority: embracing a “quality first” mindset. It will also go into key ways in which the tools and automation that are the heart of DevOps must be secured to prevent them from being commandeered by bad actors.

okay

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
well thank you very much for the

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
introduction there

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,400
i am from c prime learning and i'm going

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,279
to be talking about

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
uh devsecops and i have to be give a big

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,400
shout out here to martin

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,240
makos his uh uh keynote this morning

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
security is everyone's responsibility

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,680
he even gave me a new phrase here

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,320
democratizing security

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,079
so but let me go ahead and get started

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
we're all used to this idea of having a

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,559
security gate that we are marching

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
towards at the end of our projects here

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
it's really a problem that we need to

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,320
get rid of and so that's really what i'm

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
talking about here is how to get rid

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
of the security gate at the end of your

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
process

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,239
the security team is incredibly

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
important but they can't be the only

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
ones who are actually

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
responsible for security shifting left

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
means that we all

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
now become responsible for security in

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,280
our projects and in everything that we

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
do

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
our security team becomes important

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
moving from being a roadblock

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
to enabling us to help us to do that

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,159
with the standards the training the

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
tools

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
guidance and this is precisely the kind

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
of thing security teams

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,439
love to do so first off

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
for any project they can give us an idea

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,200
of what kind of security goals we should

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,880
set on every single project

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
they can give us a whole dictionary of

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
security terminology that we should be

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
using so we can actually all communicate

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,520
with each other

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,759
and know what we mean by these different

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,400
things they can help us be aware of the

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
threats

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
that we need to have in mind as we are

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,680
building security mechanisms into our

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
systems

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
and of course the assets worth

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
protecting uh

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
against those threats they can help us

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
to have all of these things in mind

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,600
when it comes to security stories that

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,240
we write they can help us to identify

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,920
all six kinds of security stories yes

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,079
there's six different kinds

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
of security stories here that are all

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,840
pictured and we need to make sure we do

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
a good job of putting those together

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
so they can provide the standards for us

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,319
the guidance

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,599
the support and indeed hopefully if they

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,360
have the time reviewing

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,120
our stories to be sure we actually have

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
done a good job of capturing the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
security

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
issues that we need to be paying

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
attention to

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,319
related to this is the idea of abuse

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
cases

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,360
and misuse cases those stories

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
also need to be in there and they can

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
help provide us guidance for the kinds

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,440
of abuse cases

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,840
that we need to guard against

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
they can also review our architectures

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
and our designs

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
and help us to understand where our

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
trust boundaries are

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
and where are the things that we need to

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,319
actually have

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
special focus on how we protect those

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
things

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
as we're moving forward they can help us

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
to

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,319
know how to manage our story backlog

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
and essentially trace our security

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
stories back

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,239
to the security risks that they are

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
aimed at

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,519
but also to help us to manage

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
change to our stories because every time

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,400
there's a news story

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
every time there's a change to a story

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
there could be security impacts

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
and so they can help us to understand

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
how to evaluate all those changes

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,080
and stay on top of the security impacts

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,120
so we're not opening up

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
risks they can work with our teams to

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
come up with a good design

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,920
good structure good architectures again

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,680
basic standards but also to review

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
our ideas and make sure we're moving in

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
the right direction before we've written

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
any code

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
make sure that we're moving in the right

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,959
directions and then of course the code

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
good coding standards and also

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
checklists that our teams can be using

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
as they are doing peer reviews of each

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
other's code

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
to make sure that we haven't actually

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
tripped up and done some things that we

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
shouldn't

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
be doing and then there's all the

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
security testing

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
we need to make sure we test every

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
single security feature

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,159
we need to make sure we're testing all

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
of the misuse and abuse cases that make

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,760
sure we

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
actually have protected against them we

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
need to be testing for those

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
common bugs like buffer overflow and sql

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
injection and all of those kind of

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
things

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,200
we need to be doing fuzz testing to be

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
sure the system can handle unexpected

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
kinds of situations

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
and of course we need to be doing

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,120
penetration testing

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
these are all things that our security

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,840
team can provide us the tools to do

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,280
and of course the standards that we

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
should be using as we're putting

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
together our test suites

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,199
and building our automated test systems

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,199
to be able to check for these things

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,240
so how does this all fit in the pipeline

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
well first of course

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
the peer reviews would be part of our

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
actual commit

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
process before the code actually gets

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,639
into the pipeline

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,160
so make sure that we actually have good

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
peer reviews going on

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
before the commit happens but then the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
commit stage

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
here's where you've got your code

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
scanning going on this is where you've

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
got your basic testing like the

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,479
vulnerability bugs and making sure the

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
security features are working right and

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,160
things like that

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
then when you move on to the automated

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
acceptance testing this is where things

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
like

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
penetration testing the misuse testing

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
the fuzz

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,000
testing all of those kind of things

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,680
should also be built into the set

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
of automated tests that's going to get

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
kicked off every time something goes

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
through our deployment pipeline

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
you can even have a manual hacking test

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,039
going on as part of your manual testing

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
is going on

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
but the key is that means when you get

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
to the end

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
of your deployment pipeline you don't

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
need a security gate

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,800
and that is what really what we're going

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,759
for here because our security team has

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
been working with

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,199
us through the whole process to make

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,320
sure we've built things that are

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
actually secure

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
and done all security testing that we

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
need to do

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,759
so that is actually what we're trying to

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,840
get to and it takes all of this

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
to make that happen

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,080
