Abstract: As organizations struggle to achieve the promise of DevOps — accelerated delivery of high-quality code — many fall into the trap of thinking, “If we aren’t meeting our delivery goals, we must not have enough tools.” Dev, Test and QA tools can enhance efficiency in the software delivery pipeline, but their value isn’t self-realizing. In fact, throwing tools at a DevOps project only slows things down, as teams stop and try to figure out how to put the tools to best use.

Here’s the gist of the matter. Tools don’t solve problems. People do.

This may sound obvious, but in the rush to adopt the newest shiny tool, business leaders have forgotten that no one ever “tooled” their way out of anything. They make the dangerous assumption that Dev, Test and Ops teams are performing as well as they can, given project conditions. All teams need to fix problematic processes, shorten delivery cycles or reduce defects is more tools. 

Assuming tools will fix endemic problems is like taking a car to the shop and expecting the toolbox to resolve the issue. If the mechanic isn’t trained how to use the tools properly, the car won’t get repaired.

With DevOps, the vast array of value stream metrics increases the challenge. Using metrics to benchmark progress, identify weak points, and improve processes is a tricky business. In what form do we find the capacity to interpret data and extrapolate the most beneficial changes to improve outcomes? Humans.

In this presentation, noted Value Stream expert Lance Knight, COO of ConnectALL, will explain how putting tools over people is reducing efficiency and slowing delivery cycles. He’ll also outline a clear set of steps organizational leaders can take to start measuring and optimizing their greatest source of value: their humans.

hey great good afternoon everybody and

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,320
thank you for joining me here today

00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,120
[Music]

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,960
i believe from my years of being in uh

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,800
software development i.t

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
that the road to a good devops

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
transformation starts with the humans

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,600
and

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439
i've done a lot of speaking on that

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
particularly

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,720
you know it really is about winning and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,160
if you're going to win a devops

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
transformation

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
these humans have to come together

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
whether they're software developers

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
whether they're operations

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
whether they're interested in security

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,960
whatever it is they're trying to do it's

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,079
really about how the humans transform

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,120
and the interesting part is we can't

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,120
no longer be a certain way we you know

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,160
the devops winners

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
they have to change culture too

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,559
and culture's a bunch of things so i

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
come from the i.t space

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,320
way back in the 80s where i learned

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
about celine thinking systems thinking

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
and manufacturing around

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,080
i.t for aerospace manufacturer

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,560
and back then i really was

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
nick burns right you can't have access

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
to that you can't do this

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,240
right i really was that guy that said

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
okay move it

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
help let me fix your computer it can't

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
be that anyway anymore we have to come

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
together

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,600
and change that culture and an

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,680
interesting story i have to support this

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,360
is a few years ago my wife came home and

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
by the way it's not my wife but my wife

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,840
came home and she's a business analyst

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
and i said how did your day go and she

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,600
gave this whole story about

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,680
how the devops engineer uh gave her a

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
whole hard time about

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
grooming the backlog wrong or doing all

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,040
those things and trying to enforce

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,479
process and us operations people

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
myself included tend to lean that way

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,840
where it has to become more of an

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
enablement where

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
everybody's figuring out how to work

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
together and the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
research i've done and seen through the

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,640
company here

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
and other companies is that devops

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
winners do things differently

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
devops winners tend to put one common

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
goal together they tend to work together

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
to understand

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,160
how can we you know deliver with more um

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,040
productivity how can we become more

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
predictable

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,400
how can we work together to all make a

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
transformation not just in devops but

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
from agile and so on

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,560
devops winners do a couple interesting

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
things i've learned through the years

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
the human side of devops they try to

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
remove that hero

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
right i was him that by the way back in

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
my days in i.t

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,640
i was that hero that knew all about all

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
kinds of things

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
and i became the bottleneck in all kinds

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,959
of ways and

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
as that hero in i.t and in operations i

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,440
was a guy that was up all night too

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
but they try to try to eliminate those

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,640
roadblocks

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
share knowledge make sure that people

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
can work together

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
and i found that a lot of the devops

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
transformations and the winners of

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,959
devops are doing these types of things

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,480
devops winners look at metrics so they

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
follow these lean metrics

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
types of stuff where i look for

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,640
continual improvement

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
in software delivery how i move code to

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
production

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
you look at flow metrics door metrics

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
they use these metrics to be better at

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
what they're doing

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,920
and they use all kinds of different

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
metrics to achieve their goals as well

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
devops winners look to improve the

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
systems

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
so the ones i've worked with they look

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,159
at how do i use lean principles how do i

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,080
use

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,159
systems thinking to improve how software

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,000
moves through how do i make sure that

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,200
i'm looking for the right parts in the

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
system

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
to make sure things are moving so i do

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,519
get the right level of security how do i

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,239
make sure i'm

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
putting in feedback loops through my

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
system in order to align

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
to the software needs and make sure that

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
we're accelerating with our devops

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
feedback loops

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,239
those are really important feedback

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
loops within your system

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,680
devops winners also to pick

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,040
tools last now what do i mean by that

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,239
they're going to go look at all the

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,599
things they're going to measure the

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,639
system they're going to

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,519
use systems thinking they're they're

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,840
going to

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,400
make sure that they're collaborative and

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
they're going to go look at tools

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,160
after they've figured out how to fix

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
this system

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
and by that they'll have to see measure

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
and automate and the tools is the last

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
part

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,320
i can see my value stream my devops

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,680
stream i can

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,400
i can start to measure that and then i

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,240
can use tools to automate

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,960
so my last slide it's simply this

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
devops windows start with the humans all

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
of us work together to drive code into

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,680
productions faster

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
to deliver what our customers need and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,040
if we don't have the humans

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,800
all working together and collaborating

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
we're only going to get that age-old

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
resistance between

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
i want to be secure and i want to deploy

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
fast

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,840
so thank you very much

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
