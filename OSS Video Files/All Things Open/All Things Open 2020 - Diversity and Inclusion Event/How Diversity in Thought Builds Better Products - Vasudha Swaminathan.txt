	Presented by: Vasudha Swaminathan, Stack Overflow
Presented at All Things Open 2020, Inclusion and Diversity Event

Abstract: By incorporating more diversity in knowledge and information sharing, we're able to build products that solve more problems and reach more people. We will talk about how we incorporate that into Stack Overflow's product development, why collaboration is important and how you can build this culture of diverse thought in your organization.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,240
so folks

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,840
good day uh thanks for being here you

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,639
know it's funny there used to be a time

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,759
when i would say

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,200
good morning good afternoon um actually

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,199
think about what time it is but

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
everything is just blurring these days

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
and i think good day is a really nice

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,119
way of getting out of thinking about

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
what time

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,000
it really is um so it's really great to

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
be here with all of you today

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
um it's a it's a chilly day in new

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,160
jersey

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,640
so if it's okay with everyone i'm gonna

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,200
imagine we all flew into san diego last

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,600
evening

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
and are enjoying some nice balmy weather

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
right about now

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
uh all right jumping in um we should

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
have a ton of time towards the end

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
of the presentation folks for any

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,039
questions you may have i think i should

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
be able to get through this in

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
15-20 minutes um so i'd love to hear

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,280
some voices and see some faces

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
uh once we're through this presentation

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
so kicking off

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,719
um let's start with a little bit about

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
me i am vasada swaminathan director of

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,239
product at stack overflow

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,479
and i work for the stack overflow for

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
teens product suite

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
after my bachelor's in computer science

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,280
back home in india

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,920
i started out as an engineer and

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
developer um and even to this day at my

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
core

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
i still am that engineer and love

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,920
technology right

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
so why did i get into product turns out

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
even as an engineer what really got me

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
going

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
was the drive to create customer-centric

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
products

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
and services that utilize technology but

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,479
there was a part of me

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
that felt like i was missing out on a

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,759
key aspect of product development

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
you know the part where we actually

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
figured out what to build um

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,079
now a lot's changed in the years that

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
followed most importantly the transition

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
from waterfall to agile

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
but back in the day you know when i was

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
i was a developer

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,040
you would be handed this long prd as we

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
would call it product requirements

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
document

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
and the dev would then spend months

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,399
building to spec

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
a spec that probably wasn't even

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
accurate anymore right um

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
but most importantly though what i

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
realized was

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,799
i love absolutely love speaking to

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
customers and watching their eyes light

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,039
up

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,200
when you've succeeded at creating

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,040
something that makes their lives better

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,319
you know special brownie points if they

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,800
didn't even know they needed it

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,800
right but clearly i digress we are here

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,319
to talk about diversity of thought in

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
product development

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,920
but before i jumped in i also thought it

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,680
might be

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,400
helpful for folks to hear a little bit

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,879
about stack overflow and what we do

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
stack overflow is one of the top 40

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,360
websites in the world

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
and receives 50 million unique weekly

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,720
visitors sorry unique monthly visitors

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
our mission to help developers write the

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
script of the future

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
if you ever had a technology or software

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
question

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,280
chances are google sent you to one of

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,519
our 20 million question answer pages

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
just to give you an idea of scale a new

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,239
question is asked

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
every 15 seconds it's clear

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
that millions of developers rely on

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
stack overflow to solve their coding

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
problems

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
share siloed knowledge and ship better

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
code faster

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
but in our quest to serve the world's

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,159
developers what we realized

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,959
was not everything can be asked and

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,159
discussed

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,480
in a public setting enter

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
stackoverflow for teams think stack

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,920
overflow

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,440
but for your team right so we built

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
teams and continue to build

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,120
teams as a space for teammates to ask

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
questions

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,879
share knowledge and find answers teams

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,280
all over the world need tools that drive

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,720
collaboration and knowledge transfer in

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840
real time

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,000
probably more so than ever before now

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
they need instant access to information

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,319
in one central location

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,959
that is transparent and brings a level

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,840
of trust to shared information

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840
and this brings me to our talk today

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,879
finally right about time

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,319
ease of collaboration transparency and

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
knowledge sharing

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,640
are the critical pillars to cultivating

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
diversity of thought in your

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,920
organization

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,879
but why do we care first and foremost

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,120
when we say diversity of fart it's not

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
really about what you think most people

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280
assume that's what it is right diversity

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,280
of thought

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,280
what do you think about this idea

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
instead it's actually about

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,479
how you think and there's a big

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
difference there

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
people bring different cultures

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
backgrounds and personalities to the

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
table

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
and those differences actually end up

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,759
shaping

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,160
how we think some are analytical

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
thinkers while others thrive in creative

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
zones

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
some are meticulous planners to the tea

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
right you need to know exactly what

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,919
needs to happen

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
when and what comes after what and

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,280
others love spontaneity

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,600
a recent study by deloitte shows that by

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
mixing up the types of thinkers in a

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,400
workplace

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,840
companies can stimulate creativity spur

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,919
insight and increase efficiency

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
there's also a side benefit here

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
diversity of thought

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,840
can protect us against group think what

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
is group think

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,199
it's a dangerous tendency in groups to

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,000
focus

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
first on conformity often at the expense

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
of making good decisions

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
i'm sure many of us have experienced

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
this firsthand

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,000
driving towards consensus is not always

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
the best way of doing things

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,280
as easy and as tempting as it may seem

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
now

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,039
all of this ultimately leads to better

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360
products

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,720
now you may ask if everybody was not

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
muted here

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
why are we talking about this now why is

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,000
this even a hot topic

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,639
and i would say great question

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
today folks we live in a time where

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
information is

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
literally everywhere we no longer have

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
to put much thought into solving

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,600
problems

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,240
google it as my seven-year-old says with

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,280
a few swipes and taps i can learn about

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,160
x y and z with this

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
abundance of information comes a new

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,880
kind of challenge

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
quality we didn't have this problem 30

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
years ago

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
the information that someone found in an

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,840
encyclopedia

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,880
or a newspaper books was generally

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
accurate

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,280
time went into gathering sources and

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,880
reference material

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,840
facts were easy to understand but today

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,039
we all contribute to this collective

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
knowledge

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,280
that's huge think about it we

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
are each now responsible for how our

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
communities

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,639
whether at work or at home think about

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
information

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,280
simply by how we are involved and what

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,880
we contribute

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,520
let that sink in you are a tiny piece

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,400
of this knowledge ecosystem and your

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,840
involvement

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,120
has a profound impact on what is done

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,680
with that information all right let's

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,319
apply this to product development

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
say i'm building a new product because i

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,599
had this really amazing idea

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,639
my idea is to build a knowledge base

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,880
that everyone within a company can use

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,759
to learn new information and share

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,360
information very original right

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
all right so i'm really excited about

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
this idea i talked to a few of my

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
friends that are also developers

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
and they all agree that this is too good

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
to be true

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,880
such ideas come once in a lifetime a bit

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
much i'll take it

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
so yay we get to work building the

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,800
knowledge base of our dreams

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,880
we think about every scenario under the

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
sun of how it will be used and continue

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,479
to build it up

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
time to launch in beta and get some real

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,039
people using the product

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,400
my engineering friends love it usage is

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,840
high adoption is strong and feedback

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,199
is overwhelmingly positive i'm feeling

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,520
pretty good about myself right about now

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,520
but now it's time to get other teams

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
outside of product and engineering using

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,479
it

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,599
and let's just say i'm no longer feeling

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,759
that good

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
looking back on this it makes sense

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
right i was

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,960
only taking into consideration one

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
viewpoint the engineer

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,240
i didn't talk to say hi professionals

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,879
the finance team

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,840
marketing sales organization or even

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,960
enough developers who aren't my friends

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
without that how would i even hope to

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,800
have identified

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
weaknesses in my idea all the holes in

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
it

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,279
because turns out there were many holes

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,000
in there how would i even know

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
how to position this product who is my

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,919
target

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,519
who is going to buy this use this how do

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,159
i sell it to them

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
if i wanted to build something that met

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
the needs

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
of these people i should have included

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
their viewpoints in the discovery and

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
testing

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
i know my story is super simplistic

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,760
right

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,720
but the truth is in spite of how obvious

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,519
and glaring this example may have been

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,600
and how we

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,480
all would never want to do things this

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,320
way we all fall into this trap at one

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
point or another

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,640
this really is product development 101

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,240
but we as innovators fall prey to it

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200
all the time why is that if this is so

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
fundamental

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,480
and obvious then why do we do it

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
it's easy to gravitate towards

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
information and feedback

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
that sounds and looks like your own

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
especially

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,040
when there aren't systems in place to

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,680
ensure diverse viewpoints are collected

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,360
oh and that approaching deadline that

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,560
doesn't make things any easier

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,880
right this lack of diversity of thought

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,680
not only hurts things like development

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,640
cycles

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,040
but also our cultures both at work and

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
in our personal lives

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
interestingly enough these were some

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,800
very behaviors

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
we saw within our own staff overflow

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,080
public community

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
that did not promote transparency and

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
collaboration

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
new developers were intimidated ideas

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,160
were not being shared new thoughts and

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
questions

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,360
were actually being downloaded we took a

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,040
look at our own practices at stack

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
overflow over the last year

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
and realized that we weren't doing

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
anything

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
to address the general lack of diverse

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
information

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,399
within our own public community without

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,680
those diverse viewpoints

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
and new questions being asked we fall

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,079
short

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,800
period we needed to grow

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,079
evolve and challenge the information

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,959
that was available

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,360
and this past year has been focused at

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,480
bringing in features and processes

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,600
to ensure just that happens

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,800
in order to innovate we needed new

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,160
and varying perspectives this

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,720
is where folks we as leaders need to

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,600
push

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
the envelope and foster a culture of

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
open

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,519
knowledge sharing and diversity of

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,720
thought because it's really the only way

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
to build better products so

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,959
how do we get there right easier said

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,760
than done all right number one

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
take inventory this can be challenging

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
but

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,200
we have to be honest with ourselves

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,399
about where

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,079
our bias is within the organization

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,640
whose ideas are we listening to why

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,480
when do we ask for feedback and inputs

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,160
are we doing it too late

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,920
or too early or not at all do we do that

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,839
before we write a spec and start

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,800
building or are we starting with the

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,720
foundation of diverse information

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,040
number two create the ecosystem

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,120
now this requires a little thought and

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,320
lots of input from other teams

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,120
systems need to be put in place rules

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,880
need to be laid out for example if you

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,800
want your product team

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,959
to work with marketing and sales

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,279
leadership before building something

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,480
there needs to be a repeatable process

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,600
to make that happen

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,360
the easier the process is the sooner it

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,200
becomes muscle memory

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,240
you also need a central place

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,800
a central source of information in your

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
company

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,440
one place that people are comfortable

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
sharing this information

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
this needs to happen outside of instant

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
messaging as tempting as that may seem

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,760
folks that's not going to solve

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,680
this problem right internally we

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
actually use our own team's product for

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
this

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
every single cross-functional group uses

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
our instance

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
not just engineering product i mean

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,720
marketing sales

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
legal infosec people team i.t they're

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
all

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
in there questions are asked answers are

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
shared

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
one and done right the answer doesn't

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
have to repeatedly

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
answer it for every person that has a

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
question the tool then just

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
helps keep that knowledge fresh and

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
relevant and this

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
information transparency the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,920
collaborative nature of it

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
and the trust-based system builds for

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
strong culture of diversity of thought

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
right now this

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
is the core pillars that we spoke about

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
just a few slides ago

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
all right number three goal it if clear

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,440
goals

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,959
or a way to measure success isn't tied

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
to this initiative

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,959
teams will have a hard time adopting

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
period right even something as simple as

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
saying that for

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,519
every new spec there needs to be input

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
gathered from five sources outside the

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,040
immediate team

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,880
can start the ball rolling just that

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,600
could be super helpful right

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
communicate clear benchmarks that need

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,399
to be met

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,880
before a project moves forward and

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,480
throughout the development cycle

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,120
and then finally promote it

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
really promote it right nothing gets

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
adopted overnight

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
especially when you're potentially

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,040
breaking years of bad habit

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
constant promotion of how teams work

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,800
together

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,440
is how you change behaviors not just the

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,920
wins

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,199
of product launch and sales metrics

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,199
which can also be pro

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
a product of diversity in thought by the

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,920
way but how effective

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,600
the development cycle was because of

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
this diverse thought pool

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,320
remember celebrate the big things

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,680
along with the small all right

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,120
i'm going to leave you with a few more

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
things here that's going to probably

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,199
help you along the way

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
as you look to grow your teams out think

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,880
about some of these

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,880
things number one hire the

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
unconventional candidate

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
not the one that gets the most correct

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,040
answers but the one

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,360
that gets answers to the ones others do

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,160
not this is super interesting and it has

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
really changed

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,399
my life in a big way as i as i interview

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
more folks to join our team

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
and speak to the different candidates

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
you often you know in the past would

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
gravitate towards oh

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,160
they got the answer right right um this

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
person is

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
it we need them on our team versus if

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
you think about

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,360
that's a very different way of thinking

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,760
about this i

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
i never thought uh you could solve it

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,440
you know in in that particular

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,880
direction think about those things as

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
you look as you're talking to these new

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
folks

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,800
because that's that's a difference in

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
how they think

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,639
and that's what we mean again remember

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,680
by diversity and thought

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,320
how you think not what you think right

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,760
number two know your team and leverage

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
their unique talents

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
who is a creative thinker who is more

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,839
analytical

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
who is action oriented align those

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,880
strengths

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
to the various phases of product

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
development

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,199
and i i'm already thinking your gears

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
are moving in your head right you can

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
imagine

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,480
an action oriented person working so

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,560
beautifully towards that delivery stage

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,399
of your product development life cycle

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,800
versus a creative thinker is going to be

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
a powerhouse in the discovery

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,720
phases of your product development cycle

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
right number three

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
rephrase questions to encourage honest

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,480
feedback

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,519
don't say so what do you think about

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
this proposal

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
instead maybe try something like what

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
part of

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,160
this do you least like right be more

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
specific

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,240
if you want to elicit a good feedback

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,440
and last but not least

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,480
create a culture that is open to new

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
ideas

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
starting with yourself right don't

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,440
stifle conversations or be close-minded

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,199
to suggestions

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
even on your own ideas and maybe i

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,839
should say especially

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,160
on your own ideas okay folks

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
that was easy right i leave you today

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,440
with a challenge

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,320
to take that first step remember that we

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,519
went through

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,000
take inventory of how ideas and

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,880
knowledge is shared in your company

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
are there gatekeepers to information do

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
you rely

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
on a small subset of people to give

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
inputs

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
shape roadmaps and build products and

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,279
maybe

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
this is the part i love maybe start to

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,480
think

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,959
about what your products would look like

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,279
with new ideas and viewpoints

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
injected into the development cycle i

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
guarantee you

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,319
it's going to bring a smile to your face

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,679
and delight you even as you just think

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,959
about it

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,439
and with that i'm actually done here

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,439
thank you

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:33,840
can i answer any questions for folks

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,880
this was a really great talk um i think

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,720
that this will be

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
a must watch once we get the video

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,080
posted after the event too for those

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,080
folks who weren't able to attend it live

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
that sounds great ricky thanks

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,320
oh there is one question all right how

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,880
is stack overflow as a platform working

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,000
on integrating diverse thoughts for q a

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,720
um great question chris um so as i was

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
alluding to

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
earlier in the talk a lot's been

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
happening in the last year and a lot of

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
it actually

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,360
because stack overflow is so public

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,600
right we are default public

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,440
you do get to hear a lot of that through

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
our you know blog posts and even just on

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,039
meta with us talking to our community

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,440
um like i said a big focus has been

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,760
about

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,760
how do we bring in those diverse

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,440
viewpoints into the mix right because

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,799
what we had observed is

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,840
um all of our members that were talking

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,960
in the community

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,559
were our folks from from the many years

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
ago right and we weren't really bringing

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
in any of those new viewpoints

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,799
um you know folks that had recently

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
started getting into uh

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,840
technology and coding and we needed

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
those things on the platform if we

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
wanted this to continue to be a place

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
that's

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,000
useful for everybody so um just sort of

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,679
thinking about some of the things we've

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,120
done um a big uh part of our um

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
you know mission this year has been

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,840
becoming more welcoming right because

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
um a lot of the folks that were coming

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,400
in

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
were either constantly being downvoted

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
or were actually scared

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
to ask because they were worried about

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,880
the backlash or the reaction they would

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,160
get from some of our

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
you know folks that had been around a

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,520
long time so a lot of those experience

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,480
updates that we did was for this new

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
community

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,760
of uh users that were coming to the

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,000
platform whether it is about

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,080
the asking of a question experience

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
where we actually improved the wizard

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
and provided them more guidance about

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
how they should ask we also had this

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
mentorship

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
program where you would have long term

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
users

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,600
actually offer to be mentors for these

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,760
new folks to guide them through how to

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,039
navigate this community how do you frame

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
the perfect question

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,000
how do you ensure you're not asking

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
something that's already been answered

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
right

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
all of those things we were just getting

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,840
better at giving them those tools and

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,799
the support they needed to make them

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,640
successful

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
we also added some little things that

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,320
helped like this new

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,919
new um new contributor badge right where

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
it would literally say hey this is a new

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,159
person that just joined you know welcome

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,360
them

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
so you would actually see a visual

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,720
indicator so when someone would interact

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
with the person they would know that

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,520
this is a person that has just started

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,679
so you know

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
um welcome them into this into this

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,240
community and and help them

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,320
in the process we also did another

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,559
project called comment classifier

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
which actually is a bot that

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,000
automatically

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,600
flags comments that should be reviewed

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
right and i think most folks know we

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
have

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,919
moderators um on stack overflow

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
that are constantly reviewing flags uh

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,919
but the onus is on

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,159
a user to flag these things so instead

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,080
this comment classifier was a great way

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,520
to automatically flag things that we

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
believe um

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,440
you know look like something that that

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,760
needs to be reviewed or taken down

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
and that allowed our moderators an extra

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,559
sort of tool

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
uh into taking things down that weren't

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,120
as friendly as we would like right

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,799
so a lot of those things um are underway

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,880
we've updated our agreements

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,919
with our community and the moderator so

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,799
lots going on

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
uh around that uh aspect but again the

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,960
the bottom line of all of this is

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,799
how do we bring in that diversity and

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
thought not just in the products we

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080
develop

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,679
but also in the community uh communities

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
using our products especially in our

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,919
case with stack overflow

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,679
i hope that answered your question chris

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,480
all right we have one more

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
question uh what company or companies do

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,679
you feel

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
does all of this well ali i'm just going

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,559
to say no one right like there is

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,720
always room for improvement um when it

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,480
comes to diversity of thought and i know

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,960
these days inclusion and diversity is

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,360
such a big topic like if you go to

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,720
the careers page of any company it's

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,400
going to be front and center where they

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
say you know we have a diversity and

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,039
inclusion program you know we're

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
constantly looking to

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,640
hire and uh and grow our uh our employee

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,440
base to be much more diverse right

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,200
um in practice and in action it all

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,919
comes down to what actually happens in

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,679
there and

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,120
i mean i i don't know what happens in

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
all of those companies right but i will

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
say this

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,240
that every single place there is room to

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,799
get better including our own

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,559
right and while i explained how we do

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,799
things at stack and and how

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,919
we've actually been able to leverage um

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,000
the stack overflow for

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,360
for teams product to help make that

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,120
happen um

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,960
like i said there is always an

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,960
opportunity to make things better

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
what's what's important is for this to

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
become muscle memory for folks right

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,000
versus

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,000
a forced um you know like you're say

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
you're interviewing a candidate and uh

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
or

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
you're working through a product project

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,120
and you're like um halfway through it is

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
when you realize oh

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,480
i didn't really show this to anyone

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
outside my immediate team or

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
i didn't really share this with

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
marketing or sales right when that

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,919
happens you know something is broken

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
right

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,840
it's only working when these things

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,000
happen organically and naturally and

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,640
doesn't feel forced it should just it

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,120
should just be muscle memory like i said

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
um all right one more question as

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,000
someone relatively young

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
and trim oh i'll take that as a

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,760
compliment and from a non-technical

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,880
background working in technology

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,840
how can you help hiring managers

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,760
team leaders understand the importance

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,919
of different perspectives

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
different thinkers to teams this is a

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,120
great question and this is anonymous i

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
wish i knew who this was

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,240
but anonymous attendee this is a

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,600
wonderful question

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,400
um things are changing right and

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
um yes um you know we've come a long way

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
i was i was

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,279
talking to you guys all about uh you

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,840
know from waterfall to agile and how far

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,440
we've come

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,679
um this aspect of

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,760
bringing in diversity of thought as i

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,919
was mentioning in the earlier question

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,880
is a very very important and apparent

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
topic like

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
case in point this conference right

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
inclusion and diversity

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,000
is one of the main topics that's being

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,520
discussed at all things open and we have

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
different speakers speaking to all of

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,640
those

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,279
sessions right so what i will say there

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,919
is

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,120
um hopefully if you are in the right

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,799
organization

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
this is not going to be a new topic for

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,440
you to bring up right

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,440
but what i will say is don't don't uh

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
think of yourself as someone that's

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,480
young and relatively new don't don't um

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
you know go into the conversation with

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,559
that preset

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
notion right go into it looking to

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
engage with them about

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
about this topic tell them hey um i

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,320
would love

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,960
uh you know to have folks with this kind

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,880
of experience or someone who comes from

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
this sort of a background right like

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,279
give them um

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,440
actual tangible skill sets or types of

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,480
experiences like i said again the focus

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
here is about

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,400
the how they think right which can be

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
influenced by their culture their

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
background

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,960
uh whether they're analytical versus

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,080
creative so lots of things you can do

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
there is one

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,520
arm the person you're talking to with

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
some of those talking points right

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,400
that's number one

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,400
number two this definitely got to be

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
some kind of an interview script or some

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,600
sort of a

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,200
you know hiring plan right see if you

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
can provide some of those inputs in

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
there

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
so that you can tease out some of those

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,840
things because oftentimes

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
those hiring plans and interview scripts

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,200
haven't been touched

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,240
in a long time right and could probably

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,320
use a refresh

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
so you can go in and see if you want to

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,159
ask questions

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,279
a certain way i can flip it on it's on

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
its head right

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,320
um to to in inside uh entice some of

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,760
that response you can actually assess if

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
this is somebody you want to bring on to

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,760
the team right

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,640
so again i think my main advice here is

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,320
um don't go in uh already sort of

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,640
cutting yourself short like

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
you you that the reason you're thinking

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,480
about this

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,039
um is it's important and you need to go

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
in

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
armed with the ammunition to have that

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,480
conversation so you can actually get

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,520
the change going right i think i think

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,240
those would be my main

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:12,320
main points of advice for you

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
