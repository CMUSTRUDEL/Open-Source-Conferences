Abstract: Open source programming is professionally and personally rewarding, but many people are intimidated by the barriers to entry and the field's reputation for hostility to newcomers, especially members of marginalized groups. As a computer science professor at a minority-serving women's college, I have countered this by guiding students, as part of their required coursework, to learn and apply the necessary skills to make contributions to open source projects. I will share what I have learned over the years about breaking down the barriers to help other educators, mentors, and open source practitioners increase participation.
