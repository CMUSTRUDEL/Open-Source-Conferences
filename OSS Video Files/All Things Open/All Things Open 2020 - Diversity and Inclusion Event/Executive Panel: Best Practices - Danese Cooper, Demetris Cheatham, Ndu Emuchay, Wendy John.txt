pronoun thing i am a she pronoun

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,079
the usual one boring i know um

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,399
okay so uh let's do the what is your

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,200
company doing to increase dni

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
um i want five minutes per person and i

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,840
want to hear

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
um the top three outreach efforts or

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,159
initiatives that you're doing and we're

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
gonna do it

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,200
in the order that i call you and i'm

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,399
gonna call in do first

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,200
sure um so on this particular topic um

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
i think for for me the preamble is

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,360
threefold

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,080
one ibm recognizes that diversity

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
and inclusion is good business so that's

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,800
number one number two

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,840
is that um progress in this area really

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,040
does require all of us all of us born

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
on working together as one

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,840
in order to drive topics around

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
diversity and inclusion and then thirdly

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,000
transparency is critical uh so with

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
transparency you can measure success you

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
can have

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
a clear view of where you are versus

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,840
where aspirationally

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
you want to be and that's the context in

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
which i'll describe

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,599
the three specific um initiatives that

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
we're driving at ibm

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
number one is embrace social justice so

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,360
this is an umbrella

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,120
initiative that really captures what

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
we're doing around representation and

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,760
transparency what we're doing to lead in

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
good

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
tech i spoke briefly about this during

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
the keynote

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,760
session this morning thirdly it's about

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
creating economic

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,680
opportunity not just within ibm but

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,720
external beyond ibm

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,200
and then it's about social justice

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,200
policy advocacy now for example actually

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,280
reaching out to our legislators

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,400
are such that we're able to provide

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
insight into how best to go about these

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,760
policies

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
and how those might actually affect um

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,159
the citizens

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,560
and then number two broadly is embrace

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,080
learning which is really learning about

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
these topics that are critical

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
and actually quite urgent now you know

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
how do we have

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
individual learning journeys that can

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,159
actually enhance our understanding

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
of topics related to diversity and

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
inclusion and then

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,879
thirdly and broadly it's about allyship

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,360
we know that diversity inclusion

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,680
requires everyone working shoulder to

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,239
shoulder so allyship becomes

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
critical and then specifically um in

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
terms of

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,439
what we do at ibm and what we've done

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,120
over the last number of years

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,799
um recently our ceo arvind krishna wrote

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,840
to the u.s congress

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
outlining detailed policy proposals to

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,280
advance

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,639
racial equality we had about 800 plus

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,680
ibm's actually use a grassroots tool

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,000
to send um 2 300 or so

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,440
letters to members of congress really to

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
have them come together

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,759
in a bipartisan way in order to pass

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,479
um legislation that affects in a

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,680
positive way diversity and inclusion

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,320
number two ibm has supported the passage

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,199
of hate crimes legislation for example

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,440
in georgia we expect the the same

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,199
legislation to pass in arkansas

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,520
in 2021 and then nearly a decade of

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
of work that ibm has done around a

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,039
program

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,039
we refer to as pathways in technology

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,160
early college high school

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,120
p-tech for short actually builds

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,320
pipeline even before professional um

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
sort of hiring

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
occurs so the p-tech program we have

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,080
made a commitment of

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,759
really graduating 10 000

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,560
p-tech interns by 2025

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,479
and then recently in july this year we

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,680
made a commitment an announcement

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,120
uh to actually have a thousand paid uh

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,479
p-tech graduates um be um

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,360
really given jobs within ibm by

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
2021 these are just some examples that i

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
will point out

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
and then there are quite a number of

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
others which i will speak to

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,520
subsequently as part of this

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,600
conversation thanks very much

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,520
thank you so much and and before we go

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
to the next one i want to say

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
that um if you don't realize that

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
lobbying

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,520
is something that nonprofits cannot do

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
and most open source

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
projects are non-profits we're not

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
allowed to lobby politically

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,759
but corporations can um through

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,479
establishing pacs and in other ways

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,240
and having direct outreach and lobbying

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,479
organizations that they fund

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
and it's hugely helpful to have

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,000
alignment on that

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
that is one of the ways that open source

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
won

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,479
and and as you know ibm was a big part

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
of that

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,560
and so thank you for pushing this agenda

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
because we need the lift

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,720
and we can't do it from where we're

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,919
sitting a lot of the time so thank you

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,759
absolutely okay great let is let's move

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,800
along and i think we'll do

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,199
demetrius next by the way you came in

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
under and do thank you for that all

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,039
right

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
you ready let's go thank you so much and

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
i know that you asked for three denise

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
but i'm gonna sneak in a fourth one but

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,000
i promise to stay under my five minutes

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,840
uh hub we organize our uh diversity and

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
included and belonging efforts under

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,759
four pillars

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
that's people platform policy and

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
philanthropy

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
and so in our people initiatives of

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
course we have measurable objectives

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,479
around hiring

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,080
retention and advancement one in

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
particular that i have to speak about

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
because

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
i'm new to this role and github requires

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,319
that

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
everyone that joins the company has to

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,080
have a diversity inclusion and belonging

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,199
interview as part of their interview

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,319
process

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,520
and so in my work that was so critical

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,319
for me to see

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,000
and to experience because as we all know

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
diversity inclusion and belonging is

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
daunting work

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
it's highly rewarding but it's also

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
daunting

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
and so if you have a culture in which

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
you allow

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,919
everyone to come in and then it's our

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,280
job to try and convince people

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,039
that diversity and inclusion and

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
belonging is important

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,560
that's really rolling a ball and pushing

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
it up the hill

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,280
but if at github we want to make sure

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,080
that everyone that comes into our

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
company

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,000
already has that commitment to diversity

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,680
inclusion and belonging and that's what

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the purpose of that diversity

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
interview is as part of the interview

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
process

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,560
the second pillar is around platform our

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,440
vision at github is to be the home for

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,960
all developers and what does that mean

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
that means that we want

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
everyone that's on our platform no

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
matter who they

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,680
are or where they are to really know

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,599
that they are safe and that they belong

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
and so how do we do that we do that

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,279
through many initiatives but one in

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
particular that we're especially proud

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
of

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
is that we recently changed all of our

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,839
default branch naming

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,240
from master to maine

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
and we're working with our partners and

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
all others in the git community

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,920
to do the same thing so that this

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
becomes an industry-wide

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
best practice not just something that

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
one or two companies do but

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
something that we all do our third

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
pillar is policy

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
and endu just spoke about some of the

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
policy initiatives that they're doing at

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
ibm

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
at github we have a strategy around tech

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
inclusion

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
and so we make sure that we um sign on

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,320
to amicus briefs and

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,080
advocate for policy issues that affect

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,000
underrepresented individuals as well as

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
communities who are diverse to make sure

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,640
that they have a place

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,640
in open source software as well and so

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
one particular amicus brief that we just

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
signed on to this summer

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
was the one that was affecting

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
international students who were living

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
and studying in the united states

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,480
we wanted to make sure that those

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,760
students knew that they could you know

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,440
be safe here

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,440
that they could also work in the

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,680
companies they could work at github

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,000
and they did not have to go back home to

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,920
wherever their home country was

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,839
that we needed them here in our tech

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,640
industry and so we were proud to sign on

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,000
to that amicus brief as well

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,000
and the fourth pillar is philanthropy

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
there's so much amazing work going on at

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
github and i'm pausing because i was

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,800
trying to decide which ones that i

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,399
wanted to talk about

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,000
github matches up to 15 000 employees

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,399
15 000 per employee to donate to

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
any charitable organization of their

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,880
choosing

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,800
if it's a 501c3 and our employees

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
they make a contribution to that

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,279
organization

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,160
github will match that up to 15 000

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,120
they also allow an additional 40 hours

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
annually

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,320
for employees to actually go and work in

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
charitable organizations of their choice

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
and not only are they giving them that

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
time off it does not have to go against

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,959
their pto

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,200
they will also make an hourly

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
contribution to their organization as

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
well for

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,519
the time that they work there this is

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
something that we've seen has

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
really increased the amount of

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,360
philanthropy and volunteerism and giving

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
to organizations that our employees are

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
passionate about

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,320
and in addition to the entire employees

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
making those

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,640
um contributions github also donates to

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,959
organizations that are important to our

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
employees as well this includes

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,839
organizations that are

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,720
working to fight racial injustice and um

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
racial inequality and social and justice

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
and this

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
includes black lives matter and campaign

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
zero as well so

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,000
like i said i snuck in for there but

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,000
hopefully i stayed in my time denise

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
again with the muting um now you did

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,640
very well thank you so much

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,240
and um the the you got a lot of kudos

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
when you mentioned the renaming and i

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
know that renaming was mentioned in

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
keynote this morning as well um i think

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
that

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,959
that uh it's a good time to take stock

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
of all those kinds of

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,160
you know old behaviors that have been

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,519
lingering in the tech

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,320
community for so long and um github as

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,920
sort of the the youngest company in this

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
this group of course is going to be the

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
most

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,320
forward pushy you know um the thing that

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
i love

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
about github is when i go to conferences

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,519
for you guys you get to make your own

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,399
octa-cat

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,200
and your octa-cats are very diverse that

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,680
you know you can

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,839
you can you can make your octocat be

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,440
anybody and you can be that person and

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
when i go to that conference there are

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
so many different people there

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
that much broader audience than i have

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
seen in

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
20 years of going to tech conferences so

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,600
i really appreciate

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
the the forward push that github has

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
made

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
both in the way that we work and in the

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,160
kind of people that we are

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
so thank you very much for that all

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,760
right wendy you are on

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
uh for your statement and i'm really

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
looking forward to hearing it because

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
i've been spending a lot of time around

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,959
banks lately

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,320
so tell me your stuff sure no problem

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
thank you so much

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,959
um so at fidelity we strive to build a

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
workforce that celebrates and elevates

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,320
employees of all backgrounds and all

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,360
diversity and so we

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
we do this for two main reasons

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
we want to provide relevant experiences

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,079
for our increasingly diverse customers

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,920
and we want to serve as an employer

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,320
where people from all backgrounds can

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,440
build

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,480
dynamic thriving careers as one of our

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,880
over 45 000 employees i

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,040
myself have been at fidelity for just

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,600
over 23 and a half years

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,000
you know i was born in the caribbean i

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,880
was initially educated in canada

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
um and i've lived in the us for over 25

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
years so

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,399
i bring a wealth of diverse experiences

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,639
just even in my own journey

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,440
and i've had the opportunity to have you

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,880
know five or six already distinct roles

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,079
with very different

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
focus areas in my time at the firm

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
you know we believe that taking a

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,399
behaviors based approach to change

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,000
and insisting on accountability for all

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
will help us to continue to drive that

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
change

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
and so if you caught my keynote this

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,399
morning you heard me talk about our

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,519
simple starts

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,720
framework and so that concept prompts

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,040
our employees to make

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
adjustments to their behaviors and the

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
business processes that make up their

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,399
day-to-day work

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
we feel that by focusing on behaviors

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,959
within your immediate control

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
rather than trying to shift the entire

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,880
organization's culture which

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,160
i think to dimitri's point is seems

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
daunting

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,680
we see incremental changes that add up

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
significantly

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
over time so in terms of the three

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
distinct areas of inclusion and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
diversity that you asked about i would

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,320
say

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,639
our first is increasing the diversity of

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
our workforce by getting more diverse

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
people in the door

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
and we try to do this by getting our

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,120
employment opportunities in front of

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,360
diverse communities

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,959
through partnerships and targeted online

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
advertising

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,519
as well as removing bias from the

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,839
application and interview processes

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,760
but we know that we can't make progress

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,720
through recruiting alone

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
so we also focus on developing the

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
historically

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
underrepresented talent that we already

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,880
have at the firm

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
removing barriers and creating support

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
systems for historically

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,199
underrepresented employees

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
and that takes the form of a few

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,040
different efforts

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,760
this year we're pilot piloting several

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,720
bespoke

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,399
programs so our lift program which is a

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,360
sponsorship program

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,680
for black and brown leaders in the firm

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,440
that

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,040
assigns them a sponsor and they become a

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,120
protege of that sponsor

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,440
and the sponsors are senior members and

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,440
senior leaders in our firm

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
aspire to lead which is a tandem

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
learning experience

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,399
and development experience where an

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,720
individual

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,480
let's say more mid-career and their

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,279
manager both go through

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
an experience over several months and

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,000
we've heard already

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
for many that we're going through this

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,120
program particularly earlier this year

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,639
um in june with you know in the wake of

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,959
george floyd's murder

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
that being in that program together

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,040
really helped

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,320
many of both the managers as well as the

00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
employees that were going through the

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,959
program

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
find a way to have a really courageous

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
conversation

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,279
about what was happening in the in the

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,040
broader community

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,519
and then we also have partnered with the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,959
nook online or now known as kahila

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,199
for custom women focused programs

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,240
and so we have tailored these programs

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,480
to engage

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
some of our underrepresented employees

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,560
or women and people of color where we

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,279
know that sponsorship and advocacy

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,600
is is really critical and this is also

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,240
where having employee resource groups

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,160
and special interest groups add value we

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,720
have an incredibly engaged associate

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,079
population with over 26 000

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
employees out of our 45 000 involved in

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,800
one or more of our

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,839
of these groups and i'd say finally

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,519
as a customer obsessed organization we

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
know that our diverse people help us

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
create customer value

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,800
the people we serve are incredibly

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,600
diverse

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,279
and more so than 70 plus years ago when

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,279
when fidelity first started

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,279
and we always strive to create relevant

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,120
experiences for them

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,280
so this means ensuring that our products

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,480
and services resonate with all

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,640
not just the majority so a great example

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,679
of how we've done this in recent years

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,160
is our office of customer accessibility

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,839
in 2018 our enable erg

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,280
which focuses on those that are

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,720
differently abled

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,640
proactive fact at fidelity we were

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,919
necessarily accustomed to of

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
disabilities as

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,200
dimension of our customers but we know

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,000
that disabilities likely impact

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,919
one in five americans have a disability

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
so it stands to reason that of

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,280
fidelity's 30 plus million customers

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,320
about 20 might have a disability in

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,080
only seven months the enable erg created

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,440
and pitched a business case on what they

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,039
believed to be an opportunity to

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,919
strengthen our business and our customer

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,200
offering

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,280
and the office of customer accessibility

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
or the oca as we call it

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
a dedicated business unit to improve the

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,760
customer experience for people with

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
disabilities by ensuring accessibility

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,600
is now a design principle in everything

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,480
that we do since its inception

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
the oca has been instrumental in winning

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
new business

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,080
and retaining existing business and for

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
example to deepen our relationship with

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,919
existing clients

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
we often share best practices to help

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,880
them

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
enhance their own accessibility and

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,559
disability inclusion

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,320
and we strategize with them on reducing

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,400
their unemployment rate for qualified

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,960
candidates with disabilities

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,799
so the oca has often played a role in

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,000
the process when we bring in new

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
customers

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,799
and we found this to be really critical

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
first for some of our customers even as

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,039
they consider

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,880
their own position on dni as a prominent

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,880
factor in how they do business

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
thank you so much that was really

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,799
interesting okay

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
well we have some some chatting going on

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,960
already around

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,320
this topic and people people uh really

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
are appreciating some of what they're

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,039
hearing

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,320
and also people starting to ask

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,000
questions already

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,679
we are going to get to audience

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
questions so if you have more questions

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
for these folks by all means bring them

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,080
up and

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
and i'll get to them i promise but in

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,919
the near term we have a plan

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
for what to talk about next to get this

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
started

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,160
so um what we're going to do is we're

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,880
going to talk about big wins

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,640
and um we're going to do it a little

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
sort of piecemeal because you guys

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
just outlined some of it so i'm going to

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,880
ask some of the questions about those

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
wins

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,520
so um so as to bring them up and if

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,679
one of the other panelists has something

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
that they want to say while that's going

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
on they can indicate

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,640
just like people do because um there are

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,080
only four of us so we should be able to

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
pull it off that way

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,039
so uh starting out i'm really interested

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,240
in this p-tech initiative and do um

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,360
so uh what i'm curious about

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
is if you're the

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
the effects that you're seeing in people

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
that are not going to go through

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
classical

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,360
education paths most of the best

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,039
engineers that i know

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,720
many of the best engineers that i know

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,280
did not go to cs school

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
but i know that as the industry

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
crystallizes

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
that will become less and less common

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
and um

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,520
we're pushing people through these boot

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,520
camps and creating almost

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,720
uh dual citizenship if you know what i'm

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
saying there's the people that are

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
scientists

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,760
and there's everybody else and my my

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,520
wikipedia page says i'm a computer

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
scientist but that has been formally

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
challenged

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,360
more than once because my degree is in

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
french

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,039
literature so how could that be true

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,559
right

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,799
so what do you have to say

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
well i think this is a great a great

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,520
point great question

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,400
we recognize that um the formal

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
educational system doesn't always

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,320
account for

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,360
all of the capability the talent the raw

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,760
talent

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,679
that we bring to bed we also recognize

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,039
that people are multi-dimensional

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,679
so while you may have a degree in

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,559
in literature on english or some other

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,360
degree

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,840
you could also have you know very good

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,640
um

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
innate skill around computing or around

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,720
programming and

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,480
and other kinds of creative efforts um

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,760
the p-tech program

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,400
essentially recognizes what's going on

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,760
in the industry recognizes that we

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,960
truly need new college jobs we need

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,640
opportunity pathways for people who

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
don't always

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
match the profile for those who want to

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,039
go to

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,240
formal schools and then we we need to

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,520
catch them early

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,360
as we do this so nearly a decade ago

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,080
um ibm actually put a new face to um

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
to technology creating new pathways for

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,919
science for

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,240
technology for engineering um really

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,400
centering on this idea that we can have

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,760
a new breed of

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,440
um folks uh joining the industry

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
taking full advantage of their

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,280
capability their innate natural

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,559
capability and actually finding a

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,679
pathway

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,720
to career or to vocation

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,520
that they love diversity has

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,960
always been important to our industry

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,159
and to the technology industry

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
specifically

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,720
and then there is more urgency now just

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,320
given uh the movements uh that we've

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,240
seen over the last uh

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
number of months uh based on some of the

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,760
tragic uh

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,400
incidents but the p-tech program is one

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,320
that ibm really founded um

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
quite some time ago we made a commitment

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,720
to have about 10

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,080
000 young people go through that process

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,280
by 2025 and as i mentioned earlier

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,480
um in july of this year we actually made

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,679
a commitment to have a

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,720
thousand of the p-tech uh graduates uh

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
have paid uh positions within ibm and

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,200
that number

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,360
will be fulfilled by 2021. we believe

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
that this is transformational it can be

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
replicated

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
it's already being replicated and it's

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,320
something that really

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,480
complements all of the other efforts

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,799
it's not an exclusive idea

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,840
that once uh we do p-tech nothing else

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,799
exists in fact

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,960
we've extended the work we've done

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,360
working with historically black

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
colleges and universities around quantum

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,120
computing

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
along with the announcements we made to

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,039
establish research

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,520
facility with these historically black

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,279
colleges and universities we also

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,880
donated um 100 million dollars and that

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,840
announcement was made

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
around skills academy really growing

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,039
skill

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,760
in these new areas like quantum like

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,000
machine learning like ai and so forth

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,080
cloud computing included that could

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,360
actually begin to change

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,720
the trajectory for how technology really

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,240
drives social change thank you demetrius

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,440
on this topic

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,440
um i think of github as kind of a place

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,440
where people can start

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,679
out you know it's a tooling company but

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
also there's all that emphasis on

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,080
entry and i know a lot of people that

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,679
found their way into the industry in

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,799
companies like github

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
and i'm curious if

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,559
i know that that you're going to take

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,559
the best and brightest that you can find

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,080
but do you have specific programs to

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,679
onboard people that

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,279
maybe don't have quite the skills

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
profile that you would normally look for

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,360
if you were

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,279
looking for best and brightest sure so

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,279
one program that we have at github is

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,120
called the nurturing program

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,960
and what that is is that if someone

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,120
comes through the interview process they

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,200
github and we realize that they would be

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,440
a great value add to our culture

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
but they might not have the skill set

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,279
that we're looking for now

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
we actually place them into this nurture

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,000
program where we will actually help

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
upskill them and keep in contact with

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,520
them so that

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,640
when another opportunity is available

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,200
that they are then

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,200
ready like that becomes the source of

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,600
our talent pool so that we're looking to

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,840
not

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,760
just bring in the best and brightest

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,000
talent for those that happen to see our

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,919
open wrecks at the moment and apply

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,440
but we're actually nurturing hence the

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,320
name of the program

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,520
them along the way and making sure that

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,200
quite honestly

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,960
even if the opportunity isn't that

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,320
github that they'll be ready for an

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,159
opportunity somewhere

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,919
like we don't take a look at diversity

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,080
and inclusion and belonging as something

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,400
that's unique and only should be just

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,720
for github itself we want to grow the

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,480
entire tech industry we want to grow the

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
entire open source industry

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,320
so if the opportunity is not at github

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
we are more than happy for them to go

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,880
work at fidelity

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,039
ibm microsoft any of the others and so

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
that's what we're looking to do again

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,360
yeah i really like that lift for

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,279
everybody part of your program i think

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,679
that that's an open source value

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
basically all the boats have to rise

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,360
right and

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,400
it for open source to work and that that

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,240
makes

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
coopetation more valuable than

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
competition

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,120
and you know the industry continues to

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
consolidate

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,679
so so that competition thing's going to

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,000
become more and more important anyway

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,960
so that's great okay so um

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,960
wendy i think of banking i mean i worked

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,159
at paypal which is supposedly a

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,559
you know an edgy sexy bank as banks go

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,440
because not so old right and and yet i

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,760
still found a lot of bankers there

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,799
who were risk averse and change averse

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
and and

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,159
you know really really comfortable where

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,520
they were sitting how do you change

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,240
things up at a bank

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,919
to in this way i mean how do you how do

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
you approach it

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,559
sure well first off and and certainly no

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
no offense to the banks but

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,559
so we view ourselves as a financial

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,360
services company but we also have a

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,400
pretty

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,320
heavy technology component so um

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,799
25 of our firm is are in technology

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
roles and even here in north carolina

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,880
where i am 60

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
of our employees um and we have over 3

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,279
500 here

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,880
um are in technology so i think you know

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,000
but it's fair to say that there are a

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,880
number of industries

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,880
probably um both the financial services

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,399
and technology industries that

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,679
are predominantly white and bad and so i

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,480
think it takes

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,679
real persistent sustained effort and

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
intention

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,200
um and so a lot of what you know i talk

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,279
about internally

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
and we're seeing a lot of senior

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,440
leadership

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,679
um engagement with this is about being

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,840
very intentional in our actions

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,080
um as hindu talked about you know being

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,559
very intentional in terms of where

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,720
you're recruiting and expanding the

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360
range of schools that you might recruit

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,320
from

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,440
so we expanded our range of schools to

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,520
include a number

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,279
of you know of historically black

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,919
colleges and universities

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,799
not just the national ones that people

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
talk about

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,159
some that are in close proximity to us

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,559
in our regions

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,000
um i'd say it also includes you know

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,960
recruiting acts that affects

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,200
women's colleges as well right dude and

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,159
really um having some very specific

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,360
programs

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,720
that focus on women and and making the

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,120
financial services

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
um industry and roles and financial

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
services

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,320
um more attractive to them so again it

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,039
goes back to the intentionality

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,679
of the engagement um and i think in some

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,760
cases

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
you know where you know that there are

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
underrepresented groups

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
it is okay to have targeted programs and

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,000
that's why we talk about sort of our

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,799
our bespoke programs both in terms of

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
recruiting

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,399
but then also for underrepresented

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,200
groups when they come

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,000
into the environment to know that they

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,720
continue to be supported

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,840
on their journey so that's that's what i

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,039
would share and i think

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,320
the other real you know um let's call it

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,000
the business imperatives

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,679
aspect of that is you know the

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,880
demographic change

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,120
has happened already um so the customers

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
are continuing to become more diverse

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,120
and we need to be able to

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,080
you know produce products and services

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,919
and understand

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,799
our customer base and the the best way

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,080
to do that is by having and representing

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,679
our customers internally yeah i know i

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,919
think you're right about that

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,760
okay we have a professor who has been

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,399
asking waiting to hear an answer about a

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,520
question

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,679
i'm going to read you his question

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,120
because it's carefully written i'm a

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
college professor

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,559
one of my equity issues with my my

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,320
students and i regularly discuss

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
is the way that the tech industry

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,679
prioritizes personal projects and

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,200
outside of class work

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,279
teaching yourselves new languages and

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,799
platforms students who need to work to

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
pay their way through school or support

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
their families are less likely to have

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,039
time for personal projects

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,399
are there ways in which the tech

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,919
industry is considering those issues

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,520
it's a good question because this is an

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,360
open source conference and

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,679
one of the things about open source is

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,600
we're all we're all hot shots to learn

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,640
new stuff and always be on the cutting

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
edge

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,039
and so um does anybody have anything to

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,399
say about this thorny issue

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,399
i think it's an interesting question

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,159
i remember when i was traveling a lot in

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,760
india

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,520
at the beginning of open source and we

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,159
were talking about the virtues of open

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,559
source

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,440
the truth was that most people didn't

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,559
have their own computers at home

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
and um so asking them to do work after

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,399
hours was

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,559
was a big ask for instance

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,919
speaking directly to the question about

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,960
um you know

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
education specifically in undergraduate

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
um

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,559
institutions we again however trying to

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,679
make sure that our platform can be part

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
of the curriculum

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,200
of a lot of you know colleges and

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
universities

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,679
not just computer science so it goes

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,799
into engineering programs but in other

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,720
programs as well

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,080
so we have an amazing educational

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,159
organization that

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360
that's literally what they do is that

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,480
they create

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,880
different offerings for github

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,080
and you know different get in different

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,039
technology to be

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,799
embedded inside of the curriculum um i

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,120
actually teach um you know i

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,399
have a part-time spare time work that we

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,080
all have right

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,000
at north carolina state university and i

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,519
teach intro to entrepreneurship to about

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
450 students

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,840
every semester and so now that i'm at

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,799
github i'm looking at how can i

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,000
incorporate

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,799
our platform inside of our curriculum i

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,960
mean it's about

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,799
entrepreneurship because tech skills are

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,440
going to be valuable for

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,880
every major not just computer science to

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,399
the point that you were making earlier

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,240
denise about

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,440
your undergraduate degree and how people

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,799
are questioning whether or not you're

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,200
computer scientist

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,480
that's going to be more and more common

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
um as you know

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,919
technology becomes more prevalent in

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,720
that github we feel like our

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,480
our platform is uniquely positioned to

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,120
be able to introduce that

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,399
inside of the educational curriculum um

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,559
there's a policy

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,080
a few uh not too long ago that was

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,120
passed in india

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,200
that said that technology has to be a

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,440
part of the core curriculum starting in

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,760
the sixth grade in india and on up

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,840
until they graduate and so this is going

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,840
to be the norm now and so i think

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,240
if companies haven't thought about how

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,240
they're going to incorporate technology

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,679
um inside of the curriculums i think

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
they're behind the eight ball at this

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,240
point and so to answer the professor's

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,080
question

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,080
i think instead of us having the tech

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,799
industry expecting students to learn it

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,559
outside

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,240
of the coursework it's going to be

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,240
brought inside of the coursework and i

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,159
think that's going to address the issue

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,760
yeah let me say that at the beginning of

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
open source there were a lot of

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
forward-looking college professors who

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
had their kids

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,559
bombing into existing open source

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,480
programs

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,480
and you know you got your grade if you

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,120
could get a commit going in one of these

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,799
projects

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,279
and it was super disruptive to everybody

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,919
summer of code was in part an answer to

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,840
that

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,519
but there are now starting to be schools

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,880
like i know johns hopkins has just

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,919
started an institute of

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,399
applied open source and they have taken

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,159
seven important software projects that

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,240
they've developed internally

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,919
that they're now going to open source

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,519
with an eye to mentoring their own

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,159
students into working on them but

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
in the public way right and that in that

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,720
way they're not

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,559
trashing other people's open source

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,000
projects they're pushing their own

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,399
agenda but they're also giving their

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,799
kids

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,240
course time to work in this way that

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,240
we're talking about so

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,679
that's another example of somebody

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,600
getting fancy about

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,279
how to not disrupt people's lives too

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,720
much while asking them to learn this

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,279
stuff which i think is

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,080
is really interesting i hope that that

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,440
helped you

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,120
um professor we also have

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,279
um a question yeah go ahead wendy

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,039
i was gonna say i think earlier i spoke

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,960
a little bit to this about

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,640
you know it's also important to i mean

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
first of all we we all

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,240
interact with and use technology right

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,519
now right i think

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
every university is is doing the same

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,080
and

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,679
i think the question was around just

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,720
sort of creating equity

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,040
in the opportunity for all students and

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,599
so

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
just being mindful that there are a lot

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,240
of

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,240
individuals it's the same thing that

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,879
comes up around

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,440
lack of internships or other types of

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,520
jobs

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,560
right and so for those individuals that

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,720
are trying to

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,159
you know take on multiple jobs or have

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,480
other responsibilities

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,560
they're not always able to take london

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,879
particularly ones that are unpaid

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,720
and it's the same potentially for the

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,240
opportunity to participate in some of

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,000
this other project work

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,000
and so that's where we talk about things

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,919
like in the hiring process

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
to not look for things that can be

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,679
taught

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,399
so you know and i know some may argue

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
that maybe

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,079
coding can't be taught but i would argue

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,320
that it probably can be and to look for

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,960
some of the other skill sets around

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,440
intellectual curiosity the look about

00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,839
around

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,599
sort of the diversity of the experience

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,720
and perhaps that individual

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,400
brings more to the team

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,320
um and maybe you're you're hiring them

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,079
for a different set of skills um

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
than than what you might traditionally

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
be looking at and i just think we have

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
to think about

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,520
you have to think more creatively in

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,119
terms of who we're hiring and what they

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,800
bring to the table what's already

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,560
represented on the team

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
that maybe you don't need to over index

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,400
on that allows you the opportunity to

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
bring a more non-traditional candidate

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,240
or someone that maybe doesn't have

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,960
um all of the you know perfect

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,720
experience set um that you might be

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,119
looking for

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,480
well another another factor here is we

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,280
know there's going to be a shortage of

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
programmers going

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,119
forward so we're going to have to be

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,240
looking broader more broadly afield

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,079
to find warm bodies

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,920
some of whom will be like me and we'll

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,800
take to it and it'll be a career for

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,119
them and others

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
won't but it's also we have to

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,160
acknowledge that

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
there's a lot of hard work involved in

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,280
getting ahead in this

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,720
industry and and um

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,960
most of these people that they're in the

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,640
situation that this professor is talking

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,960
about are already working at

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,960
full capacity just to stay above water

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,079
if they're also working to make you know

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
to earn money to maintain

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,160
a family or something like that i

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,800
imagine that this landscape is even more

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,240
interesting in a place like africa so

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,320
and do what do you have to say about

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
that i mean bringing africa into the

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,079
tech

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,160
sector um is as seems like it's taken a

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,800
long time i i remember 10 years ago when

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,400
i was at wikipedia kenya got its first

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,720
really good network connection

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,000
yes i i agree i think it's an uneven

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,400
uh picture um on even because in some

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,359
places you actually have um

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,560
infrastructure

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,240
that um is quite contemporary um even

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,440
better than what we have in the united

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,079
states just because

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,720
you know there is no um there's no

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,960
legacy

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,400
in some cases that builds from scratch

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
and everything is high speed and

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,920
everything works

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,520
and then i see that and then in other

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,079
places you actually have

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,760
the challenger which is a constrained

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,040
environment but that also creates

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
opportunity because

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,920
what you find is you have to write

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,119
efficient coding you have to

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,920
adapt to the environment you have

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,520
you know elegant code that works in many

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,880
of these environments

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,680
and what i'm seeing is just a ground

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,880
swell

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,240
of um of excitement

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,119
about what is to come out you know ways

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,160
by which they

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,640
solve particular you know problems or

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,000
even

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,320
create opportunity today um given this

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,200
um just plethora of opportunity that

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,960
exists

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
across different countries across the

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,800
whole continent

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,000
and then the broadband connectivity that

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,680
exists right through

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,480
these um submarine uh cable systems

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,920
to the rest of the world so now i speak

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
to young people in africa

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,119
they see the world as their oyster they

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,440
see no

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,920
limit to what innovation can do they

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,079
connect to open source communities

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
all around the globe right so now you

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,359
have a network of

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,920
very talented very passionate

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,599
folks who can collaborate with

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,599
contemporaries around the world

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,920
solving problems that they themselves

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,359
have clarity around they there's

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,119
problems exist around them the

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,119
opportunity exists around them

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,800
and they're able to tap into that global

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,040
network of talent

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
to make change happen that's what i see

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,560
i'm just from

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,839
advantage point in africa but then

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,880
understanding that

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,040
um there's connectedness and at times um

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
even for me right now i i'm here in

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,720
africa but it kind of feels like

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,160
it doesn't really matter where where i

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,040
am right because

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,079
i feel that way right and then i think

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,800
then the difference

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,920
is do we have a fidelity of

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,160
understanding

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
of the problem set do we have a fidelity

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,359
of understanding

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,320
of the opportunity space and if we do

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,640
and technology

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,720
is at our fingertips and the communities

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,240
are ready to jump in with passion

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,040
and ingenuity then i think um there is

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,200
quite no

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,880
no limit there's no limit quite frankly

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,640
to the innovation that

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,960
that can occur either in africa or the

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,119
rest of the world

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
that's i i agree with you and i am

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,359
working hard to try to lift

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,640
um ireland in exactly that direction as

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,240
well and ireland

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,599
as a european country is really

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,160
interesting because they're very

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,280
generous

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,440
about refugees and so there's all these

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,000
syrian war refugees there and refugees

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,680
from other

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
other parts of the world that have had

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
strife that don't look like the rest of

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,200
ireland but they're in there

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,560
and they're fitting in and their kids

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,280
are going to school

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,800
and um and they're contributing to the

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,720
economy in really interesting ways and

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
because the tech economy is so important

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,839
that's part of the scene so how to get

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,960
open source

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,200
funneled into that that education system

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,200
so that we turn out more collaborative

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,359
workers it's not even

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,680
do they know open source it's can they

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,920
work in a in the open source way

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,920
because i believe that's where all work

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,960
is headed i think that engineering has

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,880
to head that way

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,240
collaboration is so much more efficient

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,160
we know that now

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,000
so why wouldn't everybody cut down their

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,720
silos and figure out how to get more

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,880
cross

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,000
cross company collaboration and then

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,119
inter

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,520
a disciplinary collaboration as well

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
um so demetrius we have a lot of

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,000
interest about

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,520
the the diversity um interview

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,359
and what that feels like maybe five

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,800
questions about it so say a bit more

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,800
about that if you would

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,240
and i have to say that my diversity

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,040
interview was obviously a little bit

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,720
different right

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,720
than you know everyone else's that's

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,400
coming through but the diversity

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,760
interview is meant to gauge um

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,760
every candidate's commitment and passion

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,280
towards diversity inclusion and

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,800
belonging

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,640
all those things you just spoke about

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
denise whether or not

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,680
they can be inclusive in their working

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,160
styles

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,640
what their experience has been working

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,599
with diverse teams

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,599
how is their collaboration will they um

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,520
facilitate an environment where all

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,520
voices can be heard

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,040
and of course that's just the baseline

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,000
right and so as you

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,640
you know apply for managerial type roles

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,040
you're asked

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,760
different levels of questions like can

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,560
you lead

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,920
how is your body not looking for anyone

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,720
to be perfect right

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,319
but making sure that they have an an

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,119
appetite for learning

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,720
curiosity empathy those are some of the

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,640
things that they'll be looking for

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,000
and then i can say with my own personal

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,520
experience

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
all the things that we talked about the

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,319
fellow panelists here around

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,280
can i think about diversity and

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,480
inclusion in a

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,480
very wide way um you know diversity

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,839
inclusion unfortunately is still a very

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,240
u.s centric topic

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,160
even though this is global opportunities

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,920
this is going to be the way of the world

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,359
and so if you start just thinking or

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,079
stop it race

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,359
gender if you you know persons with

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,760
disabilities

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,200
sexual orientation there's a lot of

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
cultural diversity

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,560
and global diversity that has to be

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,280
considered as well

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,800
and so we have an open question about

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,839
ageism for instance yeah

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,359
ageism as well generation and so what

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,960
they wanted to hear from me in my

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,359
diversity interview

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,280
was whether or not i can think out of

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,000
the box and think differently and

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,520
innovate around diversity equity and

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,880
inclusion and belonging

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
and so one of the questions in

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,680
particular so i'll give this question

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
out

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,920
was how would i approach

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,920
talent acquisition if

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,680
recruiting at historically black

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,800
colleges and universities and other

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,240
minority-serving

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,160
institutions were off the table if going

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,760
to conferences and events were off to

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,680
the table so anything that you could

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
actually google and come up with

00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,599
they did not want to hear about that

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,119
because those are the easy answers and

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,720
they really wanted to get into my

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,079
thought process

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,400
around how would we go about addressing

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,040
and

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,720
really really expanding the talent pool

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,079
because the point that you denise made

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,240
about the shortage and

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,760
talent it is very real and we're going

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,760
to have to start thinking about it

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
differently if we're going to

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,760
really recruit and have inside of our

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,079
companies and corporations

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,319
the type of diversity for the customers

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,680
that we serve and for us the platform

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,880
and the developers that we serve

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,319
great thank you wendy um

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,920
i am entertaining a question here uh

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,079
about a report that was issued by

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,359
citibank about the cost

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,839
to the u.s economy of um lost

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,680
opportunities because of racial inequity

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,079
over the last 20 years apparently the

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,240
the report which i have not read says 16

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,200
trillion dollars lost to the u.s economy

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,319
alone

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,720
in that and um i'm wondering if

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,440
you're if you're aware of that report

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,839
and

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,839
um they're talking about how we could

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,920
recoup 5 trillion of that

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,680
by closing racial and equity gaps in

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,040
employment landing housing education

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,400
related issues so some of those are

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,200
fintech issues

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,520
um are you guys looking at this report

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,119
and

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,680
and what could be done so we're very

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
aware

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,160
of you know that both citibank i think

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,680
mckinsey has a study about the racial

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,839
equity gap

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,960
and the real opportunity there fidelity

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,079
is very active

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,480
in our work around financial literacy um

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,200
and starting that really early in

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,440
schools

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,800
because we do think that that is really

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,200
the opportunity

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,920
um to teach those skill sets really

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,160
early

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,560
and what we know from experience of

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,880
doing this in the schools is that

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,000
even though our focus is on the actual

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,480
student

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,440
they take the skills that we provide

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,480
around

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,960
budgets and savings and you know

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,920
um they take those back to their parents

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,079
and their other

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,560
family members that are in the household

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,480
so the opportunity to influence one

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,160
has actually a bit of a multiplier

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,480
effect i would say

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,240
that's also the focus that we bring in

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,400
terms of our engagement with our

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,720
customers so fidelity investment

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,160
um it may not always be known as this

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,079
but we provide you know we're the

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,000
retirement service provider to

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,800
many large corporations as well as

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,680
tax-exempt entities so universities and

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,000
medical and

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,240
churches and others and so we do have a

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,560
specific focus on financial wellness

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,520
and really on understanding the

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,920
differences in

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,880
outcomes and and starting starting point

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,839
positions

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,440
right due to some of the historical um

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,720
you know biases and

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,520
bias in action in some in some ways um

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
and so we

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,000
are working to tailor some of our

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,040
experiences around financial wellness

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,440
um to engage more of a broader

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,880
diverse community amongst our customer

00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,480
base

00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,760
that's great thank you i really

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
appreciate that you answering that

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,400
question

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,079
okay so we're off the script just a tiny

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
bit because i was going to ask you for

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,720
your top improvements but we got right

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
into q

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,760
a um the q a has has slowed down a

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,319
little bit

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,680
so um and we're almost at the end and i

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,200
want to be

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,280
aware of your time because you guys are

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,680
all executives so i think i'm going to

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,440
switch to what the most important action

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,720
that you think you as an executive could

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,079
personally do

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
so this is your opportunity to make a

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,319
personal statement about inclusion

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,920
diversity and inclusion and equity

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,839
in your career doesn't have to be the

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,760
company that you work for now

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:39,839
so um starting with demetrius

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,440
thank you denise um personally well

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,000
so i was leading diversity in inclusion

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,839
at another open source company when

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,440
github approached me about this

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,240
opportunity and what

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,560
really spoke to me about this was the

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,960
way that they were trying to

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,960
use their global expansion strategy and

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,920
lead it with diversity inclusion and

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,880
belonging

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,480
and so it was bigger than just github

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,040
and bigger than one company

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,839
it was about the entire industry across

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,520
the world

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,200
and at that point you made it was

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,280
lifting everyone

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
and so that's what i want my personal

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,880
commitment to be

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,599
is actually not just focus on diversity

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,000
inclusion

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,079
at github but focus on it so that we're

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,160
making a difference for everyone and we

00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,319
have to do that through partnerships

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,920
um something that i found that since

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,920
i've been in this work is that

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,319
companies seem to be doing their own

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,760
thing a lot everybody's working to solve

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,559
the same thing

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,839
and there isn't a lot of that

00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,400
cooperation as you talked about didn't

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,480
you

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,160
and so if i wanted to have a personal

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,079
charge and i'm so grateful for github

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,319
for giving me the platform to do that

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,079
is really focus on that and open

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,839
sourcing diversity and inclusion if i

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,359
could be a little tiny youtube about it

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,000
yeah

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,400
that's excellent thank you so much okay

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
and do

00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,599
i'll say um three things um

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,880
as an ibm fellow i hope

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:08,079
that the work that i do inspires

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,400
the current generation as well as future

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,160
generations to come

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,520
and then specifically over the last

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,800
number of months we've within ibm been

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,440
driving

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,680
call for code for racial justice we we

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,480
made the announcement to that keynote

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,839
this has been truly a profound uh

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,400
process

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,760
a profound transparent uh process where

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,800
we've engaged

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,839
the black community within ibm we've

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,760
captured the essence of the fears the

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,880
frustrations

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,240
the exhaustion the hope

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:50,480
the aspirations of this community

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,280
we had um more than 500 ibm's and red

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,359
hatters uh

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,480
really participate walk shoulder to

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,880
shoulder to

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,720
uh form the nucleus of the work that we

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,359
did and then we expanded

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,079
the view much beyond the black community

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,000
to

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,160
ibm's around the world really to

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,480
participate give us the best

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,240
thoughts the best ideas show up with

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,440
their whole selves

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,079
to really define the solution starters

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,240
that we made announcements for uh today

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,000
we made announcements of five of them

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,599
this is just the beginning i will

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,480
continue to release

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,079
these to the open community we believe

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,319
that if we can

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,440
have this passionate community around

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,160
the world galvanize

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,040
accelerate and then bring the the best

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,599
thinking they can

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,720
around these kinds of solutions and this

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,599
can become

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,880
enduring and this can be sustained i

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,440
don't have to

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,160
be in the middle of this nor dale or

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,800
others

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,440
who are part of the leadership um that

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,160
created

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,680
the nucleus of what i'm describing so my

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,720
whole personal hope is

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:59,920
that we can actually have change

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,760
happen driven by the power of open

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,920
uh driven by the power of open source

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,160
communities the talent the passion

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,240
the ingenuity that everybody brings to

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,440
this that would be my hope and then

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,040
lastly what i would say

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,880
is you know really um having

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,599
this kind of community this kind of

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,960
conversation for me is a big win

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,680
and knowing that diversity and inclusion

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,559
is good business and there's abundant

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,119
evidence

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,400
that this is true wendy already alluded

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,400
to this demetrius

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,760
already said this this is good business

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,359
should be intrinsic

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:38,720
to how we work how we do business

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,400
we must shift gears very quickly go from

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,280
unconscious bias

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,079
to conscious inclusion we have to go

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,839
from being

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,720
color blind to being color appreciative

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,440
and then we have to go from passive

00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,160
non-discrimination to

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,440
active allyship and i'm hoping that

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,040
through the work we're doing

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,359
and we can get to that place where this

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,359
becomes natural intrinsic

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,200
just happens as a matter of course

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,400
rather than something we've got to think

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,280
about too

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,200
now too deeply thanks very much again

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,720
thank you when did you get the

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,280
anchor spot sure well thank you so much

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,599
um i think in terms of the biggest you

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,160
know actions that i can take personally

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,119
i would say that it started over 90 days

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,440
ago when i

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,319
stepped into an agreed critique on this

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,119
role

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,040
and i think uh you know for me i like i

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,680
mentioned i've been infidelity for over

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,640
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,520
years in various business leadership

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,880
roles

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,520
um and perhaps deliberately avoiding

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,280
diversity and inclusion as a as a role

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,079
although i had been doing diversity and

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,480
improvement

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,000
work off the side of my desk right i've

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,000
been involved in the formation

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,520
many of our employee resource groups i

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,160
had been mentoring

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,119
and advocating and sponsoring other

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,200
associates

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,280
across the spectrum not just people of

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,400
color um i had also

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,839
as indeed talked about been an ally um

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,000
and i hear now we're calling that an

00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,040
accomplice

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,200
um familiar

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,119
already with utilizing your own

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,680
political and brand capital to benefit

00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,760
others

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,079
but i think in in terms of you know the

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,440
we just have a little bit more of a of

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,640
an urgency

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,240
right now it would feel like um around

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,079
diversity and inclusion

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,240
and it goes beyond sort of the business

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,599
imperative that we were talking about

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,480
and i felt like you know um

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,760
yells a little bit of if not now then

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,880
when

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,559
if not me then and so

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,240
i would say that what i've learned in

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,880
the first 90 days in the world

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,119
which is actually tomorrow um is that

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,160
there's such tremendous enthusiasm

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,040
around

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,079
um diversity and inclusion and how to

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,640
keep the momentum

00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,680
going that there's actually the

00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,640
temptation

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,599
to take on too much and to try to do too

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,359
much

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,640
and so i'm leaning in a little bit in

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,599
terms of learning

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,960
to say no to be really intentional like

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,000
i said before

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,319
and think about what actions might

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,440
be that are really going to move the

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,400
dial and that are not just performative

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,359
in in intent right and in execution that

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,200
are really going to make a difference

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,960
and so that's what i would say is sort

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,160
of the biggest action that i personally

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,200
can take and i think if i'm

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,760
leading that effort from from the top

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,760
um along with ours our leaders and you

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,960
know that others will follow

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,920
um and so it is old that andu and spoke

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,400
about

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,079
um but i think all of us and this is

00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,520
what we believe in fidelity we're all

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,559
accountable

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,400
so we all have to make this personal and

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,200
what many have heard me say at fidelity

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,960
is that this is

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,359
hard work which makes it hard

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,000
right okay so in closing i would like to

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,640
acknowledge

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,319
that in almost none of the conversations

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,440
that we've had so far this morning have

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,960
we talked at all

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,000
about transgender people um or about

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,680
about homosexual people because

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,839
we're not getting to it we're focused on

00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,839
a different group but i want to say that

00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:16,400
i watched elizabeth burch

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,440
who was a prominent lawyer at apple

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,680
single-handedly

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,800
create domestic partnership through

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,800
direct advocacy from her desk at apple

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,000
and knowing the whole time that apple

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,920
wasn't necessarily

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,119
condoning what she was doing was before

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,520
tim cook

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,240
right before steve came back but she did

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,400
it anyway

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,520
and a lot of times this comes down to

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,040
personal

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,720
executive risk

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,319
you know people think you get to the

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,920
executive level and you're done risking

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,599
in your career you're just gonna

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,960
get the big bucks but there's still an

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,240
opportunity to show up

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,000
and push the needle forward and um and i

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,400
really applaud the three of you for

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,480
participating today and for taking all

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,960
those questions from the audience and

00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,319
um you know representing your companies

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
well but also

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,920
the imperative that we need these

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,640
companies to show up

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,480
to really create this change we have to

00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,839
meet in the middle between the

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,760
people out in the streets that are

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,640
showing up those those moms in portland

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,880
my god

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,839
you know all the people showing up have

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,920
to also have

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,960
air cover from the money or nothing

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,200
changes

00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,319
so thank you for representing within

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,960
your companies

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,799
an effort to push the money forward for

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,799
good business reasons but also because

00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,920
it is the right humanitarian thing to do

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:35,839
at this time

00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,839
so thank you so much

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,559
