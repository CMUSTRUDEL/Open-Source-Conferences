00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,439
i'm lisa smith you can find me at lisa d

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
smith on twitter

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,039
lisa women who code i'm an engineering

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
manager at zapier

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
and i'm a founding director of our local

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,760
chapter of women who code here in the

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,920
triangle

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,280
and i'm also an old i self-identify as

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
old

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
it's uh it's something i wear proudly

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
i'm not i won't

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,360
uh i have a little story

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,360
about how you can tell how old i am

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
there's a little rocket in the moon here

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,199
i share my birthday with the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,039
apollo 11 space launch so now all you

00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,160
space nerds know exactly how old i am

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
shout out to the space nerds

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,680
tech has an ageism problem

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,799
now tech has a lot of diversity issues

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
clearly

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
and ageism isn't one that is focused on

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,799
frequently because we have so many

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,000
diversity issues uh but how old

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,720
how old is old uh in tech

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
it starts at 41 which is a shock to many

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
people

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
uh surveys indicate that 82 of the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
workforce

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,079
is 40 and under but nearly half

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,600
46 is 35 and under

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,360
in the very near future like within the

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
next five years or so

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,799
one third of the workforce of the

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,280
country will be over 50.

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,920
that's kind of a disconnect tech needs a

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,119
lot of people

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,360
and if we're ignoring to a full third of

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,040
the workforce it's going to be rough

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,640
but much like sexism and racism ageism

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
not only affects the person who's being

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,719
discriminated but the larger

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,159
company it deprives the company of

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
needed perspective and

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
tools and staff they need to innovate

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,319
dnr work needs to include age as an area

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,480
of concern and effort

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,760
and an easy way to do this is to

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,040
consider non-traditional pathways when

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,360
you're looking at somebody

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,680
to hire uh i myself

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
have a non-linear career path and i will

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,440
classify that as a feature

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,920
not a book uh i started off

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,840
uh as a librarian and just about

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,440
everybody who met me was like

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,200
really a librarian huh and after a time

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,879
i began to believe that there might be a

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,800
type mismatch between person and job

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,200
uh you may have noticed i like talking

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
to people not a huge asset

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,519
i also was told i have um a big

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
personality which is not valued in

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,720
librarianship

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,040
that was a whole other story of a job

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,000
that i wasn't suited for but anyway

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
while i was a librarian i taught myself

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
how to code

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,800
and this was back in the old days when

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,080
you could know kind of everything there

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
was to know on the internet wrap your

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,519
arms around the whole thing

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,720
and so i learned how to write html

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,480
this was pre css we were hand coding

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,280
html and tables

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
the dark days

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
so i was an old school web developer at

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,840
my very first web development job i

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
learned how to write active server pages

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
which was super cutting edge technology

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
but the server lived right across the

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
hall from my

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
desk i could go over and reboot it

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,400
anytime i wanted to

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,080
um but throughout my career i've been

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
all kinds of things

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
i worked for an alumni association i

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
worked for

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
a newspaper as an online community

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
moderator

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,040
and the online coordinator for

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,799
the news so i worked in a newsroom i was

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,599
uh i did investigative work for a

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
south carolina school system about their

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,000
web presence and their technology

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,319
i built a giant i was part of a giant

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
uh effort to build a medicaid management

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
information system for the state of

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
north carolina i was a

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,040
technical webmaster at a hospital i was

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,239
a

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
builder of bespoke content management

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,799
systems

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,320
i worked for agencies for a very long

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,680
time i worked in a

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,120
giant e-commerce operation and then i

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,240
became an engineering manager so i've

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
done a lot of things

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,759
but none of them were i didn't have a cs

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
degree

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,960
and i didn't take a traditional path

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
because in between there i took time off

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,680
to be a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,960
a mom stay-at-home mom i helped

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
retired folks in a resort town fix their

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,800
computers

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,800
i've done all kinds of stuff

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,360
all of this brings a lot of perspective

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
and all of it brings a varied sort of

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
background

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,960
that is an asset to any company

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,240
um so i've had a thousand jobs or ish

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,880
you know one or two and

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
you might say sure that's great lisa how

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
do i get a thousand

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
jobs we might not want a thousand but

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,479
you're probably gonna want one or two

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,919
you know over the course of your your

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,240
tech career

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
um and it's not a a process you can

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,600
automate necessarily but there's

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,880
a simple three-step

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,120
process i'm here to share it with you

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,880
number one learn things

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,240
number two meet people

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,280
and number three take chances

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,919
okay we're gonna start at the top

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,720
learn things what kinds of things should

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,320
you learn

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
what do you want to learn what interests

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
you what is

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,960
uh super uh hot

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,520
trendy great awesome what sparks your

00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,840
interest

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,440
what's a thing that you can use both in

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,199
your work life and maybe in your

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
personal life what's the thing that you

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,080
like doing with your family or your

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,199
friends

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,520
learn those things build stuff

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
break things it's not going to work

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,919
right the first time so just keep going

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,160
at it

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
go to hackathons volunteer at community

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
code-a-thons

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,479
go to conferences

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
just about every conference this year

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,880
has got some sort of either free or

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
very low cost registration go to a

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
conference you never thought about going

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
to because it was in

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,360
uh the other side of the country or it

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
was in another country

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
you have lots of opportunities this year

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
you don't even have to step on a plane

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
or leave your

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,720
your uh your comfy sofa

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,960
so learn and learn lots of things don't

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
spread yourself too thin but you know if

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,080
you only know one thing

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,560
right it can be very tempting

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
when all you have is a hammer everything

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
looks like a nail

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
right so don't hold yourself into a

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,479
corner don't get

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,560
too one track about anything but

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,360
keep your finger on the pulse of what's

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,759
happening in technology and what's new

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,880
um i got my first php job without ever

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,960
having written

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,000
a line of php because there was a cool

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,199
uh coding exercise and i had a great

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
time building it

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
and it was super fun and when i got to

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,520
the interview they were like what's your

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
weakness and i was like i don't know php

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
and they're like well

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
clearly you did enough to to get this

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
project that we really like

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
we'll teach you the rest and that's a

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
secret that not a lot of people will

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
tell you that you're going to learn

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,319
a lot of what you do on the job i'm not

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
saying you don't come in with any skills

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
at all

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,360
but i knew how to solve problems with

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
code which makes me super versatile

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
right

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
i also got a react job without ever

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
having written react

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
the job ads said they were looking for

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
somebody with

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,360
three to five years of react experience

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
which at the time

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
was likely someone who was still working

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
at facebook because react was still

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
fairly new

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,400
and so i went to this interview and i

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,319
said look let me show you

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,759
a chart of javascript framework adoption

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,560
and abandonment

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
looks like the himalayas two years and

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
two years

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
it's over and done and people move on to

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
the next trendy thing so

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
do you want somebody who only knows

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
react or do you want somebody with a

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
proven track record of language

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
acquisition

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,599
i can pick it up and learn it and they

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,680
bought it and they hired me

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
and i got to learn on the job which is a

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,760
very concrete way of learning at least

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
for me

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
anyway when i'm doing something

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,959
practical or something that i

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
um have you know reason to be using it

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,440
rather than just sort of an abstract

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,760
project

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
then i'm going to retain more of that so

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,200
that's my learning style it might not

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,480
work for you but that works a lot for me

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,600
so you're going to take something from

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,959
every job that you have and

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,959
leverage it to get the next job

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,120
even if it's i never want to do this

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,600
thing again that is a valid thing to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,959
know and understand about yourself

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,320
i had a a very stressful

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,640
experience at one job that i turned into

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,720
a case study to get another job so even

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
if it's an experience that is not super

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
positive or

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
is it really you feel like at the time

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,880
helping you learn and grow

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,320
you're gonna get something out of it and

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,279
just use that as a lever

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,279
to get the next thing

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320
so number two meet people when i was a

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
librarian

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,120
i got uh i had the privilege of going on

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,040
uh something called the tar heel bus

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,240
tour which was brand new

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,680
uh and was organized by our very

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
uh wonderful forward-thinking very

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,800
uh very very smart chancellor michael

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,200
hooker

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
on the very first day very for we're

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
leaving the parking lot

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,920
of the friday center to go on this

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
week-long bus tour the chancellor sits

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
down next to me

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,440
in the empty seat and so we start

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
chatting and we're chatting about

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
search engine technology here again i

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
will show you how old i am because

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
the height of it at the time was ask

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
jeeves

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
super exciting because it was a meta

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,079
engine it searched other search engines

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
this was pre-google

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,880
and so we talked about this for a while

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,160
and uh the chancellor said lisa uh

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,760
i can't help but notice that you are

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
working in a job that seems almost

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
exactly opposite of what you really want

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
to be doing with your time can you tell

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
me why that is

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
and i said chancellor sir that is an

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,000
excellent excellent question i'm gonna

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
get back

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
to you on that uh i love that he was

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
able to just like sort of zero in right

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
on my

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
uh right see right through to my soul

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,959
right there in a very uh

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,320
quick time he was a philosopher so he

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,480
used to do that

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
but i met the person who would give me

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
my first online job while i was on that

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
trip

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,040
so it seems like random circumstance

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
but you're gonna meet people and those

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
people

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,200
are gonna introduce you to other people

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,959
or other opportunities

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,440
i started the local chapter of women who

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,320
code and one of the first places i went

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,160
to

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,640
visit as a location sponsor was spreedly

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,600
and spreedly apparently started

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
recruiting me

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,000
from that moment and that took a couple

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,279
of years but like i met them because of

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
women who code

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,360
our very first women who code uh

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
presentation was

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
from somebody at zapier which is where i

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
work now

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
so i learned about the company then and

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
i started using their product and then i

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
met people there

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,079
and that's how i got that job so you

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,120
never know where that connection is

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,240
is going to lead my personal philosophy

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
is typically

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,680
take all the meetings you don't know

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
what that person

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
might know or might have to offer it

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
sounds a little exhausting you might not

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
want to take all the meetings but

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
definitely don't turn down a meeting

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
from somebody that you

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
maybe have never met before or an

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
opportunity that seems sort of remote

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
just because you've never done it before

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
that could absolutely

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
lead to something else and i know it

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,560
sounds like random chance

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,600
and it kind of is but also the more you

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,440
do it

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
the more likely you are to make a

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,480
connection there

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,839
um you have to

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,839
you have to go places

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
right there's my my giant finger quotes

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,399
covered finger quotes

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
you don't have to like physically go to

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,560
places but you have to go to spaces

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,079
where people are meeting

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,200
right so find uh online communities

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
they don't have to be tech focused

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,519
necessarily they can be something you're

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
interested in

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
but find those places where people are

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,399
and

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,920
and and go there find a group that

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
shares some common interests

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,200
something you have fun seek out those

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,720
communities

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
and and join them

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,399
because networking i know it gets a bad

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
rap right it's a buzzword

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,480
people are you know got a network got a

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,880
network but networking is really again

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,279
it's a very simple process it's

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,800
meeting humans and talking to them

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
but it's not just about connecting those

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
people it's about connecting people with

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
people

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
people with ideas people of

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,240
opportunities that's a lot of what we do

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
at women who code so if you're looking

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
for a place and you can't find one come

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
hang out with us

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,240
we're super cool um and if you don't

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,880
like talking to people which i get

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,760
uh i'm an outspoken and and gregarious

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,399
kind of person but that's not

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,680
everybody's uh style

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,160
if you're talking to somebody and it's

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,120
not super comfortable for you ask them

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,839
one question and i guarantee you they

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,440
will talk

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,120
for quite some time people like talking

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,320
about themselves

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,680
they'll talk and you can nod smile

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,079
make encouraging noises but you don't

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,360
really have to carry that conversation

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,040
but chances are they're going to say

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,399
something in that course of the

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,320
conversation there that will lead to

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,920
another question that you can ask them

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
and even if it feels like you're just

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,000
interviewing them like

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
for uh an article about what they do for

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,560
a living

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,680
fine that's totally fine because in the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
course of that you're going to find out

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
something you didn't know

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
either about the company they work for

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,079
or the kind of job they do or the kind

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,000
of work that they're engaged in

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:07,040
and that's going to be super useful um

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
find that network uh networking is

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,760
is easier if you have a place or a group

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
that you can do it with

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
you need help you need support you can't

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,519
do this alone

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,880
so that's really why i started the local

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,040
chapter of women who code

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,199
i know that women in technology across

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,959
the triangle were kind of spread out

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,399
we're all over the place i was typically

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,760
the only woman engineer wherever i was

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,680
working i figured if that was the case

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,680
it was the case for lots of other folks

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
so i thought we should all hang out and

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,279
we do

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
uh pre-covered we went to brunch once a

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
month we're not doing that now but we

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
certainly have lots of activity that

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
we're still doing

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,680
can hang out on zoom i know it's a lot

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
to ask after maybe spending all day at

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,920
work

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
on zoom but these are very low key

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,279
opportunities they're very relaxed

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
they're very accepting

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,800
we're always looking for speakers if

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
there's something that you're interested

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
in

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,440
learn it and then come talk to us about

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,000
it that's the secret of public speaking

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
you only

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
need to know just slightly more than the

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,320
people you're speaking to and sometimes

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
not even that

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,120
because your perspective is valuable so

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
even if you're talking about a topic

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,639
that everybody knows

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,320
uh everything about or at least that's

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,000
what you think you are going to bring a

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,279
perspective to it that they don't have

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,199
and that's cool and people

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,959
want that all right so number three

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,199
take chances explore new opportunities

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,199
go to conferences you never thought of

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
apply for conference grants and get free

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,839
tickets even non-coiva times you can do

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
that

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,600
volunteer for free tickets that happens

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,920
too anything you want to

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,920
uh in this kind of the same

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,639
the same philosophy take chances when

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,279
applying for jobs

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
remember this that typically at least in

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
tech anyway

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
men will apply for a job when they need

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,519
only about 60 of the qualifications but

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,720
women feel like they need a hundred

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,600
percent of the listed qualifications

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,120
to apply for a job i'm here to tell you

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,759
that you know

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,759
i'm not saying ignore the job posting

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,639
but they're typically

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
laundry lists of all sorts of things

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,279
skills

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,560
qualities i'm talking to companies i go

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,000
and talk to them about how to improve

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,320
their hiring practices and

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
that's one of my first asks of them stop

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,800
writing these

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,600
ridiculous laundry lists because no one

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,000
human can embody all those things

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
nobody should and honestly when you're

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
hiring for

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
somebody that you really want to help

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
advance your team or expand your

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,600
capacity

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,120
you're looking for qualities you're

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,800
looking for for the

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
how they approach problem solving you're

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
not looking for do they have three years

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
of excel

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
like there's a baseline of stuff i'm not

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,320
saying apply

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,680
for you know senior

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,680
engineer if you're just starting out but

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
if you see a job posting that has

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
something interesting in it that speaks

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
to you

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,399
that has something in it that interests

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
you

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,839
what's the harm in applying the very

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
worst case scenario you don't get a

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,919
response

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
that's rude i like to apply to places

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,079
where they have kind of a response even

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
if it's no

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,199
or no thank you you've got a response

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,640
but there's no harm in applying

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,400
and just a little uh internal

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,360
statistic at zapier the majority of

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,559
people who work there

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,360
have applied three or more times

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,880
i was at uh our retreat in january back

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
when we could still travel

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
and at the table i was sitting at when

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,559
we were talking about this

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
person at my table had applied six times

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
i don't know if i had that much

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
resilience

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,679
after having been told no for four or

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
five times i probably don't know that i

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
would have applied this six times but

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
you get turned down once that's not

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,360
necessarily no that means

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,799
no for this specific position right now

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
things change

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,440
staffing needs change technology changes

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,520
uh perspectives shift just because this

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,280
job today was not the right fit doesn't

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
mean that that job tomorrow is not going

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
to be

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,679
so apply apply for the jobs apply for

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,039
all the jobs that look interesting to

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,160
you

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,720
so these are your three easy steps but

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,640
you don't just go one two three and stop

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
you keep doing this over and over and

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,039
over again you get

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
all of the possible jobs you talk to all

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,919
the possible people

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
you have a virtual coffee with somebody

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,000
who

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,679
hits you up on linkedin you talk to

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,679
somebody that you met at a conference

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
and that leads to something else like at

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,080
women who code

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
we have found people jobs we have found

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,160
people new jobs

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,360
we have made connections to people who

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,880
have worked on projects together

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
women who code isn't the only place to

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
do that

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,760
so look for those places but if you're

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
having trouble finding it

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,960
hit me up on linkedin i'll connect with

00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,480
you we can talk anytime

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,400
find find find that network

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,520
it's going to be there for you um

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,400
my slides went backwards here we go

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,000
okay thank you thank you so much if you

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
have any questions i'm sure we've got

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,120
some q a happening here

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
you want to talk about diversity in tech

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,679
hit me up twitter

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,120
linkedin whatever you would like and and

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,120
that's all i have here

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,559
so now we can we can talk i see there's

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
some

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,960
yeah there's quite a few questions first

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,640
of all everybody misses brunch

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
right brunch is one of my favorite

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,400
things um and and

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,000
i promise we will brunch again we'll

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,880
probably have a virtual brunch coming

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
up soon um but yeah that was that was

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,840
one of my favorite things it's a very

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
low key networking opportunity because

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
honestly

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah everybody's clapping right totally

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
deserve claps

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,120
thank you okay um you have a number of

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
questions um and i'm going to start from

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,679
the first one

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,440
okay so greg says if a senior dev has

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,720
five years of experience what is someone

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,760
with 25 years

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,320
and my answer is wizard that's exactly

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,039
right

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,240
lean into that right because your 25

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,280
years of experience

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,919
brings something to the table

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
and i am also talking to companies about

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,480
like if you see somebody with 25 years

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,240
of experience applying for your job

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,159
don't discount that as person as

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
overqualified because that's a bunch of

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,280
nonsense

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
what that is is a valuable perspective

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
because honestly

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
if you've been in technology as long as

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
denise and i have

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
you've seen trends they come back again

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,039
right

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,559
we've learned lessons it might not be in

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,240
this specific language but we've learned

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
lessons that prove themselves over and

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,559
over again and so that kind of

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,679
perspective is super

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,200
useful yeah actually inner source which

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
i spent the last five years on is

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
something i

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,400
first heard of 20 years ago and it

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,400
didn't land until open source won so we

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,159
had for there were 15 years where nobody

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,960
wanted to talk about it before

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,360
i remembered that it was out there so

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
exactly

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,000
okay um somebody wants to know how you

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
came up with the magic number 41

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
i'm gonna guess that's how old you are

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
no it is not

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
as a matter of fact i appreciate you

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,559
thinking that but no i am

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,320
beyond that no it's not a it's not a

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,880
magic so that it was that from this

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,520
the the large industry surveys they said

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
40 and below

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,880
is where the majority of the tech

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
workers live so if you're past that

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
you're old

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,760
according to the tech industry anyway

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
i'm not saying that myself frankly

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,760
like i said even though i self-identify

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
as old you know

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,880
i think a lot of it is how you how you

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
um

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,760
respond to things in my mind

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,559
old is when you're inflexible

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,919
you're not open to new opportunities and

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,440
if you have those things then yeah it

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,600
doesn't matter what the age says

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,480
yeah that's what i think too i mean i

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,320
started

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
open source the term was coined the year

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,000
that i turned 39.

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,320
yeah and yeah i've done 21 years of it

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,960
so right you know i've been working

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,400
online since before there was a google

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,960
so like yeah okay

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,120
um now here is common problem in our

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,520
area requirement of a master's degree

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,360
for a job that pays 18 to 23k

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,720
how does that even make sense and how do

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,200
you get around it

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,679
um it doesn't make sense and honestly

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
like any place that has a hard line on

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
degrees

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
is probably a place you don't want to

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,240
work anyway right

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
but typically like the way you get

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,360
around that is like

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
just like i mean it's very very common

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
in academia but it's common a lot of

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
other places like

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
you know uh no degree and this many

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,960
years experience a bachelor's degree in

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,400
this many years experience a master's

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
degree in this many years experience and

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
you can equivalent that out so like if

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,679
you've been working in the industry a

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,520
long time

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,600
you probably have more practical

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,039
knowledge than somebody with a master's

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,960
and i this i am somebody who has a

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,400
master's so i'm i'm okay saying that

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,200
it doesn't your your degrees don't

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,200
necessarily equate to any real world

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,520
experience that a company is looking for

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,120
so anybody who's got that line

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
and it's very cavalier and easy for me

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
to say that's probably not something you

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
want to work for if they have that

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
perspective they're not going to be open

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
to

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,080
to innovation frankly there's supposedly

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,760
going to be a million

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,880
vacancies you know in tech by the end of

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,440
this decade

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,919
so there is another job there is always

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,640
another

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,240
time oh i can tell you i've gotta be

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,919
able to

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,600
you know i mean i if you look at my

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
resume it's sort of a who's who

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
of the time that i that i was working

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,600
but

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
it i didn't ever try to work for any of

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,960
those companies except for apple

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
apple's the only one i actually cared to

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,320
work for the rest of them found me

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,520
um so and then the other thing about the

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,000
underpay

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,880
once again that's do you really want to

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
walk to work

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,400
one of the great things that lisa said

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
at the beginning of this talk is

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,080
it's possible that we're never going to

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
have to take the low salary in order to

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
walk to work again

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,760
right right right and and that's the

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,520
thing too so like

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,559
i guarantee you if someone is paying

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,840
very little money they will very soon

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,919
find themselves out of employees because

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
we're smart enough to talk to each other

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,440
and ask

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
and know what market value is especially

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
in open source

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,640
especially in open source right so like

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,360
while my my company

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,520
zapier is uh is global we're globally

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,640
distributed we peg our salaries

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,919
to austin texas so it's not quite bay

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,840
area salaries because

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,360
honestly who can afford to pay that but

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,880
it's also

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,480
you know over and above what a typical

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,240
market value um

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,840
is in a lot of places up and down the

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,320
east coast not new york but

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,840
you know so it's a nice median so you

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,840
can always find

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
there's all sorts of sources to know

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,679
what market value is and if a company is

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,760
not willing to pay you market value

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,120
you do not need to work for them that's

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,120
correct

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,720
okay how do you handle burnout and

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
learning fatigue if you've been in tech

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
a long time

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,120
that is an excellent excellent question

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,440
sometimes

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
you take a break and you don't pick up

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,760
anything new

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
you dive deeper on something that

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,760
interests you or you immerse yourself in

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,760
something that is enjoyable

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,960
don't work yourself to the point of

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,240
burnout or fatigue because you're not

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,279
going to be useful to yourself or

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
anybody else

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,240
and i get it where there's like so much

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
stuff happening you want to learn

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
everything don't learn

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
everything find something that's fun

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
find something that you have a friend

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
working on find a project that you can

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,640
jump in on

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
open source is great because there's all

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,799
kinds of projects out there you can look

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
around

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,080
find something that interests you find

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,799
something that like sparks something in

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,039
you

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,000
heck build legos like anything to keep

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,480
yourself

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,159
active and doing something new that

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
you've never done before

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,000
doesn't have to be you know some like

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,360
the hottest technology because honestly

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,080
again like i said two two to four years

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,200
it's probably on the outs again does

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,960
anybody remember flash

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
i used to be a flash developer right we

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
don't do that anymore i spent lots of

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
time doing that

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,200
we don't do that anymore and that's the

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
thing technology is always evolving

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
but you're always going to find

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
something that's interesting and there's

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,559
always honestly

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,200
people probably won't say this out loud

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,039
too much all languages

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,480
essentially are the same right there's

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
different syntax

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
there's some different approaches but if

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,960
you know how to solve problems with code

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,240
you can pick up

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,400
any other language that's just how it is

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,679
we're lucky that way but if you're

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,919
having learning fatigue

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,279
the other the other tip that i have is

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,039
go get a physical

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,480
try to figure out if there's something

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,559
changing in your body

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
because we have jobs that don't let us

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,919
move enough

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,240
and elise is up there dancing the whole

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,400
time but i spend a lot of time sitting

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,679
and i definitely my iq points go down as

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,559
the day progresses

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,919
so um have a look at that it's it's you

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,760
owe it to yourself

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
yeah and that's an important important

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,799
safety tip too

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,000
sleep right eat food that is good for

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,000
you and move around

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,039
that's it that's all you need to do just

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,480
to stay like

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,200
more active in life okay here's somebody

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,279
who is

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,799
um sort of worried about lack of

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,400
progress so how does he make a

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,039
difference or they make a difference

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
when

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
there are people five years younger than

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,200
them doing similar jobs to the one that

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,840
they have

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,000
because they haven't moved up i mean

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,320
that that is definitely a thing that you

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
can

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,799
feel or you can ignore because when i

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,000
was at

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,200
a previous company i helped redo

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,360
our our career trajectories

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
and i stopped calling it a ladder

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,760
because a ladder

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,039
goes one direction you're going to be

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
climbing over your colleagues that

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,159
sounds real rude also a lot of

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,760
personality ableist right

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,440
exactly right and it's also it's not

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
comfortable to stay on a ladder in any

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,399
one position

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,240
so instead i called it a pass because a

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,919
pass it's a beautiful garden

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
you walk through sometimes there's a

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
bench and you sit down and you hang out

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
and you spend

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
some time there there should be no

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,000
impetus

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,279
for you to progress unless it's a thing

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,799
you want to do

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,480
if you find yourself stagnating look

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,679
around and see is it because the company

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
that you're at is not offering you

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
opportunities

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
fine look someplace else if you see

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,679
people around you it's very much like

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,480
comparing your own picture to say

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,600
a supermodel in a magazine right totally

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,600
different scenario

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,120
also airbrushing right so like things

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,320
are not exactly what they seem

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
you don't know what that other person

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,279
has done to get their their work

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,880
but it doesn't matter what matters is

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
what you do are you still interested in

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,640
it if not find something else if you are

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,640
then do whatever you need to do to

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,279
advance it find some opportunity that's

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
like

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,480
you know some place where you can do

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
that project and work on it better find

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,039
some place where you can have more

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,080
energy behind it

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,520
sometimes as the uh

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,200
our our ancestors tell us a change is as

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
good as a rest even if you go someplace

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
and do the exact

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
same thing you're doing it in a new

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,399
place and we all know this if somebody

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
hires

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,600
they're looking for somebody with you

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,640
know 20 years of experience or whatever

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,320
they're looking for you're not going to

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
be effective on day one it's impossible

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,039
you have to go and learn how they do it

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,559
there

00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
so don't take that as a thing like oh

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
i'm going to go and i'm not going to

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
know anything yeah you're not going to

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,559
know anything

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
you don't have to learn you have to

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,159
learn how they do deployments how do

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
they do pr's how do they

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,279
you know how they were do they have

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,799
hackathons periodically do they have

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,279
team structures that are

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,440
product based or are they system based

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,880
like everybody does it a different way

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
go see doing it a different way even if

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
you do the exact same thing it's going

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,640
to be different

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,320
cool um okay so that person

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,760
later said that they actually meant 15

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,360
years younger and that's

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,520
to me a really good indication that

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,360
you're staying in your job too long

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,039
the average time in silicon valley

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559
proper i mean here in california that

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,799
people stay in jobs is like

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,799
two and a half years right and that is

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,720
the only way that you get

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,640
you you will not be able to work the

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,440
system from inside your company

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,000
to get all the way to the top the one

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,240
guy that can do that is a total unicorn

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,320
the way that you enhance your salary is

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
you get to a milestone where you've done

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,559
something you can say i did this

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
and then you go find another job that's

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,159
exactly right fine find

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,840
you know look at look back because

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,960
sometimes it's hard

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,880
look back and make yourself uh what one

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
of my friends calls a brag book

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
right here's a problem i solved here's

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,960
the problem

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
here's what it took here's what i did

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,799
here's the outcome

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,360
write that stuff down i guarantee you

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,039
you are

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,640
losing track of the things that you've

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,080
worked on just because they go into the

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
blurb every day

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,760
so keep up whatever keep a

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,840
notepad window open a physical scratch

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,600
pad on your desk whatever works for you

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,399
but take those things down because then

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,760
also

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,840
kind of makes it easier when it comes

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,200
around for review time and you've got a

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,039
list of all the stuff you did you just

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
boom put it in there and you're moving

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,720
on and then if you're

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
if you're subject to most that most

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
women one of the things i know about

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
bias

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,320
from working at paypal is most female

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,240
resumes

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,600
use assistive verbs because we don't

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
like to take too much credit

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
so we say i i helped i worked on a team

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,799
with i helped

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,120
and the same resume written by a man for

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,240
the same experience would say i wrote

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,039
i made i did right own it and so that's

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,320
the other thing

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,600
is is check your verbs and while it's

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,519
uncomfortable to me

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
to think about taking more credit than i

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,840
deserve

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,480
if i want to compete in the marketplace

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,640
with men

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,320
who are doing that then i have to get

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
comfortable with it

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,399
right and i know there is also a school

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,080
of thought and it comes probably from

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,679
our parents generation

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,120
where you go work for one company and

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,200
you stay there till you retire

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,039
we all know that's a lot of hot nonsense

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,720
and you know anybody that

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,640
that looks at your resume if you've

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,799
spent two years two years two years and

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,480
it's like oh you've had a lot of jobs be

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
like yup i went for some new

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,200
opportunities

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
i got the opportunity to do something

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,279
over here because i like this company

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
because they had something i was looking

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,360
for also

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,760
a very clever friend told me one time

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,480
you might not be great at and i suck at

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,600
for sure knowing what next title you

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
want right like where do you see

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,240
yourself in five years

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,320
frankly anybody who answered that five

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,279
years ago totally wrong just by the way

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,880
so i don't know how to say that where i

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,399
see myself in five years because that i

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,120
feel like limits me

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,720
instead focus on values that are

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,000
important to you and look for companies

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,960
that support or embrace

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
those find a place that mirrors your

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,840
personal

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,200
value statement so that you can go and

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
know that you're even if you're not

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,679
working on say

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
some life-saving application you're at

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,559
least working at a company that

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,880
understands the value of

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,240
being present in our society making sure

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
that they treat people fairly and

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,559
equitably

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
i think the two most important questions

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,000
that any new job seeker or any job

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,480
seeker can ask

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,360
going forward are how did you treat your

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,519
employees

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
during pandemic times did you lay off a

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
bunch of people did you make salary cuts

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,880
did you freeze what did you do

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,799
and what did you do to support people

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,640
during the social unrest that has

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,200
happened over the last six to eight

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,200
months

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,640
and beyond did you turn your twitter

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,240
logo black for a day or did you do

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,440
something material to support the

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,360
the wider society around you so like

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,200
look at those things and see what

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
mirrors yours and i know this again

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
comes from a place of privilege where

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,880
you can you know be discerning about it

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,279
but if you're old you've been doing this

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,000
a while right so your next job you can

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,519
look

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,200
more carefully at the place you're going

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,080
to go you don't just need to have any

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,399
job

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,399
you can but also we got to say one more

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,000
thing it is easier to find a job when

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,880
you already have one

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,480
so don't wait until you quit or get

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,320
pushed out of a company

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,640
always be interviewing literally always

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,720
always be like i just got a new tattoo

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
recently it says always be

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,600
it means whatever you're doing go for it

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,600
do it do it with your whole self bring

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,799
your whole self to that thing

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,159
so yeah like i never turn off my are you

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
interested in more opportunities on

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,200
linkedin

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,440
yeah not always actively seeking but

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,559
heck the last

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,760
three jobs i've had have come to me and

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,399
for some reason all of a sudden i'm

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
super hot

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,440
right now like i'm getting all kinds of

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,279
like interview requests right now it's

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,519
fun isn't it i think everybody is a

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,360
little bit super hot right now

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
i'm getting a lot of them myself and i

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,320
live in ireland so

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,839
exactly okay we got 10 minutes and we

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,040
got a lot of questions to go through so

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,240
i'm going to try to

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,480
squish them down um okay so

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,480
let's see oh here's somebody who wants

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,839
to somebody who's 27 and wants to

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,520
understand if there's so many

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,760
openings why aren't 40 something's

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,079
getting jobs quickly

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,919
um so sometimes it's because that that

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,839
people are not applying for those jobs

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,520
sometimes it's because the company lacks

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,000
the foresight to understand that they

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,679
need those

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,040
perspectives keep looking because

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,320
they're out there i promise

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,079
and in the meantime i'm going around

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,200
telling them stop it that's nonsense you

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,040
need to hire those people

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,720
me too and by the way there are

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,679
companies that are focusing on hiring

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,560
older people

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,399
aws is one of them yes look carefully

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,359
they've hired some very high profile old

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,280
people lately

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,879
and that's happening through their whole

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,040
stack okay

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,920
um i think people are seeing that any

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,960
thoughts about

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,640
getting certificates uh i mean

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,480
i i think if it's something that you

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
enjoy doing and it's something that you

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
really want to stay in

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,200
do it but honestly do you remember how

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
big a deal ccna was like however many

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,920
years ago

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,680
now if you see that on somebody's resume

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
it's like okay great what have you done

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
since then the problem the only problem

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,720
with getting certifications that that

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,880
that's a fixed point in time

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,839
right and you want to keep learning so

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
if you're going to learn

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,200
and there's a certification you can get

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,040
to prove that you learned it great but

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,800
don't spend a lot of money on that if

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
your company will pay for it awesome

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,160
don't spend a lot of personal money

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,599
because certifications are are the same

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
as degrees like

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
yeah you've got it but honestly can you

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,800
solve a problem with code that's that's

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,440
what i care about yeah that's what i do

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,280
too

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,119
okay here's somebody hannah is in her

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,480
late 30s switch to tech after previous

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
career and she's wondering how she

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,240
balances learning a lot of things with

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
becoming a subject matter expert

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,680
she can see the benefits of both but

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,320
doesn't feel like she's a master of

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,320
either

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,440
my answer would be follow what's

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,599
interesting to you

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,640
yes yes if you're not passionate about

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,040
it doesn't matter

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,480
so like if you know look dabble around

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,079
until you find something that hooks you

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
and then lean in hard

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,200
find that place that that makes you feel

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,960
good and there's going to be

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,079
there's a place any place it's something

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,480
that you're interested in somebody's

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,240
doing it and somebody wants it

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,000
here's what should i be learning for the

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,000
next five years let me say

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
that if you don't right now have a

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,480
subscription to

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,320
redmonk you need to redmonk is a an

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,880
independent analyst firm they're great

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,200
guys

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,040
and they do a quarterly report about

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,520
what's happening with languages

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,200
in actual employment and deployment and

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,640
that is a good way if you are really

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,359
stuck and you got to choose between

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,520
three

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,280
you can figure out who's who's climbing

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,280
who's falling

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,960
and the stack overflow survey every year

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,240
is also a good indication of like what's

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,920
hot at the moment

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,200
so you can lean into that and see like

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,400
where people are getting hired and what

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
people who are actually working are

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,359
working on

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
okay there's a couple of people who want

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,280
to continue this conversation

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,400
which i'm get i'm betting you're gonna

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,160
say your your

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,160
chapter of women who code might host

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,720
that there's some people who also want

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,079
old and tech schwag

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,359
i feel like we should do that maybe i

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,160
will set up a redbubble store and i will

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,560
send you the link

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
feels like we could do that i feel like

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,240
an old is a statement

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,400
are you gonna are you gonna um try to

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,119
host this conversation on an ongoing

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,920
basis and

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,320
say you absolutely yes absolutely we

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,560
will

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,320
um we will um i'll set something up for

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,839
women who could come to uh

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,760
meet up and find us on meetup and you'll

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,119
see you'll have the details uh

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
all are welcome okay if you are bored

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
with your current work have a dream but

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,680
don't have a path towards the dream have

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,320
you built that path

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,400
my answer is believe it or not starting

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,359
to talk about your dream can materially

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,880
take you there

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,400
yes yeah manifest it honestly like

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,440
uh if it's a thing that you're

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
interested in and you're really

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
interested in it

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,400
say it out loud because i guarantee you

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,079
somebody else is thinking about it

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,040
and if not and if you like talk to 10

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,480
people and nobody's thinking about it

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
then you've got an original idea run

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,640
with it own it

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,240
right because you've got this but also

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
don't surround yourself with people who

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,760
are telling you that you shouldn't be

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,839
able to do that or you can't do that or

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,200
you know i once had to turn my husband

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,280
off he was so

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,680
certain because i'd lost my job it was

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
2008 it was a bad time for me to lose my

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
job and

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,200
he was like oh my god what's going to

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,680
happen to us and i said look you taught

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,359
me this game you have to stop that now

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,520
and the next day wikipedia called and

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,720
asked if i wanted to be their cto

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,160
so it really does happen exactly and and

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,200
that's the thing too is that like if

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,280
you're having trouble

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,720
finding somebody who will back your

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
dream

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,480
poke me text me find me on linkedin i'll

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,839
be here to i'm i i will be your personal

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,920
cheerleader

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,079
okay on your resume how do you highlight

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,960
experience in industries other than tech

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,480
in a way that's valued by employers tell

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,160
me a story

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
that's that that's going to hook me tell

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,240
me why why i care

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,760
and that's honestly that applies to to

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,599
uh tech as well like don't just

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,560
throw a link to your github repo in

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,000
there tell me why i care i'm not going

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
to go trolling through your code looking

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,240
for gems

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,880
tell me what problem you solved what

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,640
technology you used what did you learn

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,079
tell me the story of that thing and then

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,320
i'm going to be hooked

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
yeah i i agree with that and i have the

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,520
world's weirdest resume

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,920
but people it's almost like they want to

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,720
meet me because my resume's so bizarre

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,280
right um exactly okay here's a mom who

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
wants to

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,720
wants advice about hitting pause or

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,320
slowing down on the career while the

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
kids are little and then on pausing

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,720
later

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,040
um this is a challenge she's worried

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,240
about for the for their future as she's

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,160
got little kids totally understand i

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,599
stopped for about five years but i was

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,400
always doing some

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,520
thing right in the background um so

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,079
something that interests you

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,920
come hang out with women who code take

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,280
the time that you feel like is important

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,880
you're never going to get that time back

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,240
with your kids i know it sounds cliche

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,440
but lean in if that's something you

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,880
enjoy

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,880
i mean i always knew i was going to keep

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
working even when my kids were little

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
because that's what that's what sparks

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
me is that sort of interaction

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,079
but don't don't regret do whatever

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,359
you're do do whatever feels right

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,880
and don't regret it because there's

00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,440
plenty of companies big companies that

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,000
have

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,560
pathways back into tech red ventures in

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,480
charlotte

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,839
ibm has return ships blue cross blue

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,960
shield there's a bunch of places who are

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,040
embracing that

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,640
because it helps their diversity numbers

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,240
so there's a lot of places who are

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,680
asking people to come back if you've

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,359
spent some time out come back with us

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,520
and they'll pay you to do it

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,079
yeah i agree there's people are starting

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,319
to realize that you're known quantity

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,119
and and um you know if you're a proven

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,640
worker they're

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,240
interested in you still even if you

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,000
don't think they are

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,000
so the other thing is you can always

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
volunteer with your spare time as you're

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,119
ramping back in

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,040
and i know several people that have

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,680
taken internships and companies that

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,760
later

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
later ipo'd and it was the making of

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,560
them so don't be afraid to work for free

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,119
on your way back in

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,040
okay oh as in different areas of

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
diversity are there language changes we

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,680
should embrace when talking about

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,359
ourselves well i already

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
said the one about the verbs active

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,119
verbs in your resume absolutely but

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,640
what else do we got experienced right

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,240
you've spent some time doing a thing

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,800
it's not because it's not you've like

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,359
spent

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,400
you know you're you're proven you have a

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,280
proven track record

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,560
you are an established subject matter

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,680
expert and whatever

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,000
like embrace the things that denote

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,760
time i don't include the year that i

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,440
graduated from college on my resume but

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,960
i do show all of the jobs that i feel

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
like are relevant and that i learned

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,160
something from and that i can use to

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,839
weave into my story

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
and now somebody is going to ask what do

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,040
you do about gaps

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,800
in your resume how do you handle them

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,240
again tell that story i mean i

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
you know again i don't i don't tend to

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,000
put a lot of dates on my resume i do

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,079
things sequentially or you

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,119
put together a skills-based resume that

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,480
doesn't matter

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,920
right so like i have these things i

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,680
learned i did this while i was here but

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,640
i did it here too i did this in three

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,319
places

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,680
there are always ways that you can tell

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,280
your story and if you have trouble with

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,720
that find somebody who's good at resume

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
writing there's tons of consultants out

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,319
there that will help you with that

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,920
i'm happy to look over your resume too i

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,920
know what i'm looking for as a hiring

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,280
manager is somebody who can tell me

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,359
that story so i have a rule

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,599
i have a rule where i only use

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,839
collective pronouns when i'm in a job

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,760
we did this we did that we're working on

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,079
this and when i'm writing my resume i

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,400
use first person singular

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,680
right and and i switch between the two

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,280
because when you're writing your resume

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,000
they don't care so much about what the

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,400
team did unless

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,240
they're hiring you to run a team you

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,520
know otherwise they wanted they want to

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,200
know what you did

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,800
and that's not comfortable for most of

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,359
us um

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,839
okay let's see specific tips to position

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,160
yourself

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,960
on linkedin or interviews with with your

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,319
years being an

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,599
asset to avoid ageism um

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,839
i don't know that i have any specific

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,280
linkedin tips but lean in and don't be

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,400
afraid of it i know there's a lot of

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,640
people who are

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,160
are reluctant to say that that they've

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,200
had a lot of experience in a place or

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,720
whatever

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,520
write a good headline you know

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,960
experienced technology leader

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,960
that's a great way to say that you've

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,640
been doing this a while there are ways

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,720
that you can craft that but like

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,319
put all the things on there on linkedin

00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,599
i like get endorsements from people who

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,839
said you were good at a thing

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,640
those are great too yeah those are

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,920
really good

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,599
um okay uh let's see

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,680
here's somebody that that's a baby going

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,400
by here's somebody who wants to know if

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,480
you still get

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,720
have to do the whiteboard interview

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,760
thing when you're in your 40s

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,800
here's the thing i categorically refuse

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,720
to whiteboard in any circumstance

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,319
it does not prove anything except for

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,520
that you can write on a whiteboard it's

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,000
inherently biased

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,960
it's not how we work i want to interview

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,440
with a company

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,040
that has an interview process that shows

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,200
me something about the way they work

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,560
and unless they make their engineers

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,920
stand up in front of a white board and

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,520
code in front of the whole company

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,520
don't do that to me during an interview

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,560
it's disrespectful so

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,480
i don't and i don't like anybody

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,839
i have not coded and i haven't asked

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800
anybody to code in front of a whiteboard

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,839
in a long time

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,359
at wikipedia we used to give people the

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,000
option to take home

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,079
homework and turn it in and give that

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,079
that's a fairer test because absolutely

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,319
the truth is you use the internet when

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,839
you code exactly right

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,119
exactly right and i don't buy into the

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,839
like well i had to do it so you have to

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,880
do it too

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,880
that's a bunch of nonsense so yeah clear

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,720
okay how many programming languages in

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,680
your resume before you start sounding

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,760
suspicious

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,440
i know 12 but i'm proficient in three

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
and i only list these three but others

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,200
may be useful

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,160
i always list things like experience

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
with or

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,760
you know um you've worked if you've

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,280
worked with it

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,800
that actually can be a thing and

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,240
honestly i'm not suspicious because

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,760
there are people who polyglot once

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
you've learned one or two you can learn

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,359
five or ten right so like that doesn't

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,800
make me suspicious as a hiring manager

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,240
but like make sure that it's not like

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,520
i've seen the word haskell written

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,560
somewhere right like make sure that you

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,000
actually know something about it because

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,400
they'll call you on it right so like

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,200
and also eligible to speak about it

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,000
include it

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,359
and also don't list stuff that that they

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,280
really aren't looking for they don't

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,680
care if you know cobalt i promise you

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,440
unless

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,200
that's what the job's about right right

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,680
unless it's legacy systems moving on

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,920
exactly

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,800
and if it is you should be making 300 an

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,520
hour for that

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,599
yes exactly right all right here's a

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,520
good omnibus question that we'll call

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,359
count as our last question how do you

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,680
make great strides in your career

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,520
any specific ways to jump ahead i'm

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,800
almost 40 with a non-linear

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,520
career trajectory i i don't know about

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,640
jumping ahead

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,240
just keep looking for those

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,200
opportunities keep making the

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,560
connections because you don't know

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,280
what's going to springboard you like i

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,960
was not

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,000
interested in management until somebody

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
was like hey you want to be a manager

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,119
and i was like

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,880
hey you know what i kind of do be open

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,960
to any possibility and

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,000
and don't limit yourself to the things

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,079
that you can see right

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
now if i limited myself i wouldn't have

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,000
had probably half the jobs i had so

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
just be open to any possibility and you

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,640
will find yourself it's going to be you

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
know

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,960
you'll find out you'll find a

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,520
springboard i think don't be afraid

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,359
to take a step back if you get if you

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,800
talk yourself into a career move that

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,880
isn't comfortable

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,640
you want to be happy at work and there's

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,200
no harm in taking a step back although

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,280
people will look at you funny

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,960
you might have to change companies to

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,440
have people not look at you strangely

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,040
but

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,440
some of the smartest moves i've seen

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,359
have been that taking a step back move

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,000
and um other than that

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,200
i i think just being open there there

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,520
are some jobs that are actually

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,720
impossible jobs i talked about wikipedia

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,839
cto earlier that was an impossible job

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,599
when i took it

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,119
right it almost killed me i mean it was

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,280
totally worth it and i and

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,960
it's since it's on my resume now you

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,000
know it has changed the tenor of the

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,880
conversations i have

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,319
but but it did almost kill me and it's

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,119
it's not always good

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,839
to you know to push if you know what i'm

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,319
saying

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,160
but one of the great ways to to catapult

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,359
yourself forward is become a public

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,560
speaker

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,079
and there are more and more

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,359
opportunities to do that because of

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,440
these virtual events

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,119
and there are ways to get good at it

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,800
yeah come speak to women who code we're

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:57,599
very accepting and open audience we want

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:59,680
to hear whatever you have to say

00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,680
