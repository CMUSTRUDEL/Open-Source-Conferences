Abstract: The benefits of increasing diversity in software engineering teams are well known, but the computing profession continues to struggle to become diverse, and open source projects are no exception to this problem.  This key point of this talk is that open source has a unique story to share that is especially appealing to women and other underrepresented groups.  But too often, we do not do a good job in telling the right story.  This presentation will suggest basic message elements that all open source professionals should understand are likely to appeal to the populations we need to attract.  These elements are likely to appeal to women computing professionals you might want to hire, and also the high school girls you talk to at a career night who are good in math and science but have no thought of a software engineering career.  This talk draws on experience teaching undergraduate students about open source, and a study of 234 undergraduate students that provides evidence of aspects of computing that appeal to underrepresented groups including women.
