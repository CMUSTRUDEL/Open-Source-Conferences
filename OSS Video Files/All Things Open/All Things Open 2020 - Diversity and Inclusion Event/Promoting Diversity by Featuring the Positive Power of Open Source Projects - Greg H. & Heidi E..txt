Description: 
	Presented by: Heidi Ellis, Western New England University & Greg Hislop, Drexel University
Presented at All Things Open 2020, Inclusion and Diversity Event

Abstract: The benefits of increasing diversity in software engineering teams are well known, but the computing profession continues to struggle to become diverse, and open source projects are no exception to this problem.  This key point of this talk is that open source has a unique story to share that is especially appealing to women and other underrepresented groups.  But too often, we do not do a good job in telling the right story.  This presentation will suggest basic message elements that all open source professionals should understand are likely to appeal to the populations we need to attract.  These elements are likely to appeal to women computing professionals you might want to hire, and also the high school girls you talk to at a career night who are good in math and science but have no thought of a software engineering career.  This talk draws on experience teaching undergraduate students about open source, and a study of 234 undergraduate students that provides evidence of aspects of computing that appeal to underrepresented groups including women.

	00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
all right

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,000
so welcome everybody thank you for

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
coming

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
and i'm heidi ellis from western new

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
england university

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,440
and my colleague greg hislop is from

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
drexel university and we'll hear from

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
him

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,800
a bit later let me start for those of

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
you that were here for the previous talk

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,080
and say thumbs up to ellen yes

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,000
great job with students and

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,280
really good advice on getting students

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
involved in open source

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
projects the interactions between

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
students and open source communities can

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
have some

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,640
really interesting twists and turns

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
and we tend to use the term productively

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,879
lost

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,559
because as ellen said when you put a

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
student into half a million lines of

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
code

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,399
they're not going to understand how to

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
navigate so

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
creating a class diagram is a great a

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,760
great way to get started appreciate that

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,720
so we're going to be talking about how

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,080
open source and how we can increase

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,119
diversity in computing

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
through open source and our goal is we

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,080
want a diverse

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,320
workforce we want um a wide range of

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
ideas coming in so that we have maximum

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
creativity

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
right so we'd like our workforce to look

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
something like this

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,360
the current status of the workforce

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,560
tends to look

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,640
more along these lines all right

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
so and when we look at computing

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,439
diversity and computing tends to be

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,799
worse than in many other disciplines

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,280
one clear reason for this is most

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
people come into although we've heard a

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
number of talks today about people who

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
came into computing

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
to the computing workforce sideways many

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
people still come

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,640
through college and computing students

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,479
are mainly white men

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,240
okay our work in open source

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
makes us believe that open source has a

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
story that can appeal to women and other

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,840
represented groups

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,319
but a lot of other students don't

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,720
understand open source so there are some

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
places clearly mills college is one

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
but there's many institutions and where

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
students aren't really exposed to open

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
source

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
so we're trying to create a pipeline

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,599
between education and the foss community

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,959
all right so just to show you some

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,560
recent figures

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
i pulled these actually these are from

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
april of 2020 from the national center

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,080
for women in technology

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,560
and as we all know the number of women

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
in the computing force is quite low

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,800
one of the main reasons for that is

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
there's only 21

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
of the cs bachelor's degrees are awarded

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,400
to women

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,720
so we have a pipeline problem okay

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
and again as i had said students aren't

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
exposed to much open source in their

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
studies

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
they know open source is something free

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,120
they can download for themselves

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
but they don't understand this whole

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
community community-based development

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,000
they don't get the implications for

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640
privacy and security

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,720
they don't understand the scale and

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
importance of open source

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
so we have a recognized problem the lack

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
of diversity

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
there's also unfortunately another

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
problem in the computing industry that

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
has the potential to

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
um increase the barrier to diversifying

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
computing

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,879
so 20 years ago technology was the

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
golden thing to do right the the intro

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
to google area

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,360
era people were like yeah let's do tech

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,400
in the last five years we've seen

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,319
many more stories that are tarnishing a

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
bit of that golden aura

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,000
social media has become a means for some

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,879
invasive

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
information collection tech now is

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,840
sometimes viewed as

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,560
big brother and more profit driven

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
there are increasing security breaches

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
and cyber crime

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
and then algorithmic bias and i just i

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,120
popped these up this was my

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,120
reading for the summer as i wanted to

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,880
retrench in the area

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,000
okay open source has these problems

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,800
in spades unfortunately

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,720
there's an intolerance there's a lack of

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
inclusion

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,199
flaming and rtfm occur

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
right there's misogyny in foss um and

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,360
there's

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
things like resistance to codes of

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
conduct right

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
and all of this tends to create an

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,680
environment that is

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,080
not welcoming to um to creating

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
is not ideal for creating a diverse

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
workspace

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
so a group of academics have been

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
looking at

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,720
how do we change this can foss be

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
more attractive to women and other

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
represented groups

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,639
all right so this is some research that

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
started within humanitarian foss in

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,560
about 2006

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,639
and the national science foundation is

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
interested in this they have funded five

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
grants in this area

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,000
since 2009. in addition

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,000
red hat google mozilla linux foundation

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
and wikimedia have all been involved and

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
supported this

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
this effort and students have worked on

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
a variety

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,479
of projects across mozilla accessibility

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,919
genome accessibility

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,360
um so so this is an effort

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,440
into can we make foss

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
more attractive to a wider range of

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
people

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,960
okay so to give you just a little peek

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
at research i'm not going to get into a

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
huge

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,280
amount of detail but i'll give you some

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,680
highlights in our recent work

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
we surveyed undergraduates at the

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
beginning

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,000
of computing courses so these were

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,520
freshmen and sophomores

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,919
and we this is recent work it was

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,319
carried out between october and february

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
so october of 2019 through february of

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880
at two institutions western new england

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,199
university

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,199
and nassau community college and nassau

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
community college is a minority serving

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,080
institution

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,160
we gave out a total of or

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,120
got back a total of 291 surveys out of

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
that we had 288 that were usable that

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
had enough data that we could actually

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
look at

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,000
that way so one of the things that we

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
wanted to know was

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,440
what is the impact of the application

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
area would students be more interested

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
in developing applications

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
that were that somehow had some social

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,840
benefit to them

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
and so what we did was we gave students

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
a list of

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,759
20 possible topics to create an

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
application and we ask them to give us

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,039
our their top

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
three choices so out of these 20 tell us

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,840
which

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
of the top three that you would like and

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
interesting to note

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
women chose human trafficking as the

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
most

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
that was the most commonly chose option

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
for women

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
another interesting thing to to note

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
about this is that

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,039
as compared to men and i'll show you the

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
men in it in a minute

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,160
the women had more um

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
had more diversification in their

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
selections

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
so when we look at men a higher

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,120
percentage of men

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
were focused on role-playing games

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,080
password security

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,560
board games all right and so

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,479
so those were very popular compared to

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
the women we had 23

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,120
so they spread their choices over a

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,479
larger number of different

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,440
application areas okay

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,720
so and as we can see here um the top

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
choices for men

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
didn't doesn't have a lot of social

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
relevance to them

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,440
so what we did was we went through and

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,680
we we took those 20 topics and we ranked

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
them as either having social impact such

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,080
as human trafficking

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
or having less or little social impact

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,280
on positive social impact

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
fantasy football and what we found is

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
that women

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,840
that females preferred topics with

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,639
social impact

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,879
significantly more than men so this

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,360
order of significance means that if you

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
did

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,560
the survey that we did 10 million times

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,120
you would have three instances or

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
three surveys where you didn't see the

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
difference

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,519
between men and women that was based um

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,279
on the population that it was random

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360
okay so that's huge

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,120
the other thing that we found is that

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,479
black and latinx students

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,279
we're strongly motivated to help others

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,600
okay now i'm going to turn this over to

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
greg

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,680
okay thanks so um

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
the point on this talk i'm going to i'm

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
going to emphasize one point about what

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
heidi said you know we have this

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
evidence

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
that women students are attracted to

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,519
computing

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,839
because of things like seeing computing

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,000
as something that can do social good

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,040
they're also interested in collaborative

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
things

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
they're drawn to community-based efforts

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
all those things have

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
not only our evidence the kind of

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,760
surveys that heidi was just quoting

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
but surveys done by other groups over

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
and over again indicate that that

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
the underrepresented groups that we're

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,399
trying to attract the women's students

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,080
and also for some of these categories

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
other underrepresented groups are

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,800
attracted by

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
understanding computing in sense of in

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,519
terms of collaboration

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
community um giving back those sorts of

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
things

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,800
uh and for those of us that are an open

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
source everybody in open source

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
there's a story about open source that

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
we all know right we've all drunk the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
kool-aid

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,720
along the way and believe in these kind

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
of fundamental principles about open

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,080
source

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,080
and and if you think about what attracts

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
these groups that we want to attract

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
and what open source is about it's like

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
a match made in heaven

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
that we need to be telling the story of

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,440
open source to students

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
because students don't know it over and

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,120
over again we find when we survey

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
students they don't understand open

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
source

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
they know it they open oh yeah i know

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,800
open source i use open source but that's

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
all they know i can get stuff for free

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,959
that literally is what most students

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,959
know they don't understand how it works

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,640
they don't understand how big it is they

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
don't understand how large a part of the

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,160
software industry it is

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
they don't understand licensing in ip

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,120
they have no idea

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,640
that people earn a living doing open

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
source when i say that to classes of

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
students and i'm talking about senior

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
computer science majors

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
they just their eyes get big and they're

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,079
like what they don't understand

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,320
that that's a thing so we need to break

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,720
out of the mold i think a lot of times

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
when people live in a culture and most

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
of the people that are at this

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
conference are already heavily invested

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
in open source

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
we forget or we lose sight of how little

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
people outside the culture

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
understand the culture so we need to to

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
understand that and we're telling you

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
over and over again students don't know

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
this and potential students certainly

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
don't know it

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,160
so if you ever talk to a college class

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
if you ever talk to a high school

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
career night these are things you want

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
to talk about because they're the things

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
that are likely to attract

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
more of the underrepresented groups into

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,480
computing so

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
we got four or five slides here i'm just

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
going to go through them really quick

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
because this is all very familiar turf

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
but these are the kind of pieces that

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,880
should jump

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
out when you have a chance to talk to

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
students talk to high school students

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,519
talk to college students right open

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
source is about sharing and giving open

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
source is about

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,440
transparency right anybody can study the

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
source code anybody can learn from open

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
source

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,079
open source sets up wonderful mechanisms

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
to be able to verify what a software

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,480
product that you want to use actually is

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,160
doing under the covers it sets up a

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
wonderful environment for promoting

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,880
security

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
and ensuring that security is really

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
secure

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,440
right open source sets up a great way

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
for us to have community when you become

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
involved in open source you

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
join a community students have no idea

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
that that's the case

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,680
you know so the whole notion of

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
community and open source and that the

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,839
community is more than just people who

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
program

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
that it's a whole bunch of people that

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,160
bring all kinds of different skills to

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,720
an open source project

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,079
that is completely invisible to students

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,440
or potential students of computing

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
there's another wrinkle to this you know

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,720
heidi and i believe all of what we just

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,000
said we've drunk the kool-aid too you

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
know we talk to students about

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
this for open source broadly we actually

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
think there's a double whammy that we

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,399
use in the classroom which is we not

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,160
only want to introduce

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
students to open source in all those

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
contexts that i just described

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,959
but we focus particularly on

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
humanitarian open source where the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
purpose of the existence of the project

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,519
is to accomplish some social good

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
next one heidi

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
so you have to understand the context of

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,760
this is that most universities

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,200
don't cover open source this is another

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
piece that we always want to hammer when

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
we talk to people in open source

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,079
communities

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
everybody thinks that universities teach

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
open source and that it's just part of

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
the curriculum

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
it's not right we have done faculty

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,880
development workshops for

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,440
around 150 universities across the

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,040
country almost without exception there's

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,399
no open source being taught

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,000
in the in those programs these are

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,560
computer science programs that many

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
colleges whose names you would recognize

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
and and we want to try and change that

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
but we need a lot of push to do that

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,920
and hfos is one of the levers that we've

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,959
been doing that students don't even

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
understand github

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,000
uh ellen set us up i think very well for

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
this she talked a little bit about some

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
of the

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
the experiences she's had absolutely

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,839
right on with everything that she said

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,000
in the last talk

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
all right so we have this um community

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
community if you're interested in what

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
we're doing specifically in education

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
the bulk of our talk the main focus of

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
our talk is to say hey you know open

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
source

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
tell that story to people outside the

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,680
open source community

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,920
if you're interested in what we're doing

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
we'd be happy to talk to you more

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,800
we have these these resources you can go

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,399
and look at teaching opensource.org or

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,440
fosterserved.org

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,959
teachingopensource.org has a low-volume

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,519
mailing list that we invite community

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,880
members

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,720
to be on as well as faculty to be on so

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
i think i managed to get in under our

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
time we're pretty close to it

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
um but that basically sets up the idea

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,360
that we wanted to share with with the

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440
people who tend to attend

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
uh all things open and we have at least

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,639
a minute for questions and heidi and i

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,480
will also be on the panel

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,480
which starts about 20 minutes from now

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:35,040
okay you have any questions or comments

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,800
so so one of the previous

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,120
comments was um in the in the chat

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,240
was chambi he said she worked mainly

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,839
with k-12

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,440
we've had um some success with people

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,440
um working with open source projects

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
typically at that level at the k-12

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
level it's

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
