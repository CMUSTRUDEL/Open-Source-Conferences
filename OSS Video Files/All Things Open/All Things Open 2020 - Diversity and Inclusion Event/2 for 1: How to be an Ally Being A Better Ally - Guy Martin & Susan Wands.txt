Description: 
	Presented by: Guy Martin, OASIS Open & Susan Wands, Women In Tech Allies
Presented at All Things Open 2020, Inclusion and Diversity Event

"How to be an Ally" Abstract: Unconscious bias - it’s been in the news a lot in the last several years, but usually from the perspective of how damaging it is to women and under-represented groups when combined with white male privilege.  This presentation is about the other side of this equation - how can someone who was unaware of their own unconscious bias and white male privilege learn to use these in a positive way to help these under-represented groups.  This is a frank and honest journey of one man’s struggle to separate the very real struggles of education and career from his inherent privilege as a white man in a male-dominated field.

On this difficult journey Guy Martin learned a lot, and plans to share both the positive aspects and challenges in hopes that other prospective male allies understand how to be more effective advocates for those who can truly benefit from the privilege we have.  He'll share some lessons learned, as well as some practical tips for making a difference as a male ally.

"Being A Better Ally" Abstract: At Women In Tech Allies, we explore hundreds of ways to be a better ally for a more diverse and inclusive tech community. In this short talk, I want to highlight one key mental shift that can change hiring and move the needle forward on diversity. Let’s talk about losing the “weed out” attitude and how to start looking for potential.

	00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,559
so

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
i'd like to warn you here that um some

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
of these topics can be painful

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,480
and triggering and you may experience as

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
i did kind of this emotional roller

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,640
coaster

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
as we walk through this so i'm going to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
ask for your indulgence and some grace

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,480
as a recount these stories and topics

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
that quite frankly don't always paint me

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,680
in the best light

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,880
and as denise knows i sometimes get a

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
bit choked up while giving this

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
presentation but i i think that you know

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,559
the honesty around that is actually a

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
good thing um

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,079
the reason i'm doing this is it's

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
important to me that others learn from

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
the mistakes i've made kind of on my

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
journey to

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,680
hopefully becoming a male ally and

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
hopefully you're encouraged by

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
by where i've gotten on this journey

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879
so i usually hate these who am i slides

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,320
and honestly i've

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,600
i've generally stopped doing them in my

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
talks however i'm going to make an

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
exception here

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
because i believe it's really important

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,160
for all of you to understand a little

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
bit more about me

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,960
and why i was motivated to build this

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,680
talk so i identify as a partner

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
a father a grandfather now an engineer

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
and technologist

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159
and a community member in tech in open

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,040
source and so for those that kind of

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,400
heard denise's

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
initial commentary about we'll always

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
have paris the at last uh

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
picture there the picture of denise and

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
benzema and myself at this event in

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,840
paris and

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,200
and uh it's i really do uh resonate with

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
with that community

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
um but you'll notice i listed my

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
personal things first and i don't think

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,880
that's an accident my partner nicole is

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
both my best friend

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
and my biggest source of inspiration for

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
this talk i think i've learned more

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,079
from her about the challenges of

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,680
diversity and inclusion firsthand

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,840
than in all the reading and studying

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
i've done on the topic and my kids

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
matthew raydhill and duncan

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,799
my granddaughter sophia they're a huge

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,640
reason why i built this talk

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
i want rachel and sophia to grow up in a

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
world whether they're in tech or not

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
where they don't have to struggle as

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,759
much as nicole and others have and i

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
want my sons to be the kind of men

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
that do their very best to support and

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,240
champion all women

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,000
and underrepresented groups so with that

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
i'd like to tell you a story in this in

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
this next slide

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
which is a video clip i'm incredibly

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
lucky to know some amazing people in

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,200
open source and tech communities

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,959
including my friend jennifer klower

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
who is formerly of the linux foundation

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
and she's now running her own pr firm

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
one of her passions is helping tell

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,680
stories of women in tech including the

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,640
challenges and amazing things they've

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
accomplished

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
and i was very humbled and honestly

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,080
taken aback when jennifer asked me to be

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
part of a documentary series

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,879
she's building called the chase and

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,760
graves project and maybe some of you

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
have heard of it

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,200
this is a six episode series dedicated

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
to shedding

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
light on women in technology who've long

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
been underrepresented and the clip

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
is used with jennifer and her

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
co-producer gary's permission i'd like

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
to play it for you now

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
as i think it really forms the core

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
story of

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,800
my talk

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,720
so i was attending a technology

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
conference and there was a women in tech

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
track session

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
and i decided i wanted to attend that to

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,959
try to be

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
a supportive ally and even at that time

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
didn't know that i was an ally so i kind

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
of wanted to go to see what this was all

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
about

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920
so i walk into this meeting and i'm one

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
of

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
a half a dozen males in a room full of

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
women and i

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
kind of look around i'm not sure what to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,720
do and i go and i sit kind of at the end

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
of one of the tables

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
and i didn't say anything for most of

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,680
the meeting and then i was asked a

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
question about community management and

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,879
what i thought

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
we could do in the community management

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,040
space to improve diversity and inclusion

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
in women in tech

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
and i gave an answer and then i was

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
called out

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,440
i was called out by someone who said

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
well the problem is that we have way too

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,400
many

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
white male community managers in tech

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
and you're actually part of the problem

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
i just had a very visceral reaction i

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,760
responded in my head with

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
well wait a minute this doesn't make any

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
sense how can this person who doesn't

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
even know me

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
be calling me out for something that i

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
didn't even realize i had and

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
i was very angry i felt betrayed i kind

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
of said well wait a minute

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
i came to this meeting i could have been

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,040
anywhere else in this conference

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
i chose to come to this meeting because

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
i believe in increasing diversity and

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
inclusion

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
and to be attacked like that was a very

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
very challenging thing for me

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
i just kept getting angrier and angrier

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
and angrier and i just had to leave the

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
meeting

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
and thankfully you know i left the

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
meeting and then

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,880
basically went on this journey of

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
discovery so i think

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,880
that was the most powerful thing i saw

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
come out of that was that i could really

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
begin to understand

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,840
again the motivations of what caused

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,840
that person to call me out in the

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
meeting

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
and so as you saw from that clip i was a

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
bit blindsided

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
um and i have to tell you i was angry

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
frustrated

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
resentful probably saw it in that clip

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
and a little bit embarrassed

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
um i wanted nothing more to to than to

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
just storm out of that room or tell that

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
person off

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
and thankfully nicole was sitting there

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
and denise was actually in this meeting

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
and nicole had me gently sit down and i

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
kind of seethed through the rest of that

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,120
meeting and

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
you know be pretty honest i see really

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
through this next six months

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
every time i thought about this incident

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,039
um

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,120
and then oops

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,199
one slight too many and then it kind of

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
my journey began and through nicole and

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
denise and other people's patient

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
tutoring i began to think more

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
critically about what happened

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,039
and and i think the biggest issue with

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,560
what had happened for me was twofold

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
number one as you heard from the clip i

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
kind of struggled through college worked

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
a couple of jobs

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,320
minimal help from my parents and i felt

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,039
like really worked hard for what i'd

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
achieved

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,000
and i couldn't understand how

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
unconscious bias and white male

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
privilege applied to me i mean

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,039
i was like hey i've worked hard this

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
doesn't make any sense i also

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,000
could never truly understand what it's

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
like to be someone in an

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
underrepresented group

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
and i think these two facts led to the

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
biggest misunderstandings

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,039
of my reaction to this whole incident

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
so i spent months and probably longer

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
than that

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,880
extremely angry about all this and i

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
couldn't figure out why i was being

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
singled out

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,440
uh i really felt like i was being put on

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
trial by that person in the meeting and

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
others who kind of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,319
piggybacked on what she had to say and i

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,080
took it very personally

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,440
i associated all the pain and the

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
anguish that people from the

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
underrepresented

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
groups were just venting they were just

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
really venting and i

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
viewed it as a personal attack on me um

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
in short you know i don't i don't think

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,199
i could really see how

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,479
um they relate to how they saw the world

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,000
uh and i always thought it was a very

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
fair person but my frustration

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
and anger were showing up in the way

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
that i brought unconscious bias to

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
things like

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
being upset when i wasn't chosen to

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
speak or write about open source and

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
community and

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
you know when i had friends from

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
underrepresented groups who got talks

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
instead of me

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
uh so yeah i i have to admit it i went

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,919
through that whole reverse

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
discrimination argument in my head

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
um it wasn't a good time and it made me

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
focus on the wrong thing which was me

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,039
i had to get past worrying about what

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,840
the effect was on me

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
and think about how i could move past

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
this

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,840
so my aha moment in all of this is when

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,520
i finally was able to realize that my

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
white male privilege and unconscious

00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
bias

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
in no way diminished any of the

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,080
struggles that i'd that i'd had in

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,240
college or

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
where i'd come through in my career

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
being white and male was

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,680
clearly not my choice but you know

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
reading and thinking about this and most

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
importantly

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
working with trusted friends and

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
colleagues from these underrepresented

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,599
groups i began to slowly understand that

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
i had these advantages

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
that i hadn't earned and quite frankly i

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
was blind to them

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
so making the distinction between my

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
struggles and hard work and the inherent

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,479
advantages i have as a white male tech

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,919
wasn't easy it was probably one of the

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
most difficult things i've ever had to

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
do

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
um and it's i think it's one of the

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
hardest things sometimes that men and

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,479
tech

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,759
even well-intentioned ones struggle with

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
so thankfully

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
uh jennifer clower and her team did

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,599
capture how i finally came to a better

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,479
point in this experience and i'd like to

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,479
share that with you now

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,800
so the journey i embarked upon when i

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,280
was called out in this meeting

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
for having white male privilege was to

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
try to ask

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
questions of female counterparts that i

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
trusted and actually men

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
that i knew were already good male

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,479
allies i wanted to learn from

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
their experience and get an

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
understanding of what white male

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
privilege was because i think what i

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
reacted to in that meeting was i can't

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,160
possibly have white male privilege

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
because

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
i struggled to put myself through

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
college by having two jobs i struggled

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,039
academically i struggled

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,360
personally and finally being able to

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,400
understand by asking questions of those

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
that i trusted

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
that there wasn't a there wasn't

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
anything that diminished my struggle

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
having white male privilege did not

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
diminish my struggle it just

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
made me realize that i actually had a

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
responsibility

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,279
if i truly believed in diversity and

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
inclusion in tech i had a responsibility

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
to understand what white male privilege

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,480
was

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
and to understand how i could use the

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,279
inherent advantage i have by being a

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
white male in tech

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
to further diversity and inclusion

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
being a part of the the women in tech

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,880
movement is huge

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,480
it actually gives me a sense of purpose

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
and when you get that sense of community

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
from

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,519
women in tech who are who are have had

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,279
challenges and who have understood

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
that you've also had challenges but in a

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
different way that support is

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
tremendous

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
so i think i was surprised i was as

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,519
surprised as anyone when

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040
some of my colleagues including nithya

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
and denise started mentioning me in

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,240
their talks

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,440
or to others as being a male ally uh i

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
don't think i really still think of

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
myself in these terms um you know it's

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
not as like i get up every morning i

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
slap my

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
male ally name tag on and i go out to

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,680
face today

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
i think if you're trying to if you're

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,560
trying to do it for that reason you're

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
going about it for the wrong reasons

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,480
uh and you're definitely going to need a

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,040
lot of help so you know that being said

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
i recognize this through this process

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
that as a white male in tech i have a

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
tremendous opportunity and a

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
responsibility to change the prevailing

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
situation that's been going on for so

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
long

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,480
this situation isn't going to be fixed

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,560
solely by legislation or by training

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
programs or awareness campaigns or by

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,279
lobbying

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
those are all important components but

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,959
honestly nothing changes

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,800
without without people in the majority

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,600
position like myself and other white

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
males in tech stepping up and working to

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
try to see it better tomorrow

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,839
using the privilege we have to foster

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,839
the change we want to see

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,920
so one of the things that i think helped

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
pull me through a lot of these

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
challenges

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,480
i early on i was raised with a strong

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,480
sense of duty and service to others

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,000
uh for me it manifested itself in things

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
like being a cal fire volunteer

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
for for over 10 years so with that as a

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,320
framework i'd like to share

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,959
some ways i've found um and i'd love to

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
hear more

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,040
in the discussion later um about how to

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,519
use privilege and service of others

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
so number one calling out bad behavior

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,519
uh

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
and this is tough because when you call

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,079
out bad behavior you don't want to

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
encourage pulling by

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
behavior by giving them the limelight

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,600
and one of the things i've learned

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
through um doing this is that i

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,399
sometimes would get too engaged in

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,839
calling out bad behavior

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
and then get engaged with the troll and

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,440
then actually diminish

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
you know calling it out it kind of made

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
it about me again um

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,360
be someone who's willing to listen and

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
and not judge but or try to fix a

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
situation

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
because sometimes um people from

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
underrepresented groups really just

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
someone wants someone to honestly listen

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
to them

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
um and then finally using your inherent

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
privilege to lift up others things like

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
helping get women and others to speak at

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
conferences advocating for the

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519
mid-leadership roles

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,839
and helping partner with them to get

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
their ideas heard and acted upon

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
and so i want to leave you with some

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
final thoughts here as i close um

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
some of the important lessons i kind of

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,959
learned in my journey along the way

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,200
and number one the number one and it's a

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,959
huge one is it's not about me

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
really recognizing that was the was the

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,240
beginning of my

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,079
actually getting to a good place and it

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
was a hard one to swallow uh both

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,360
me personally from being an only child

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
also to being someone who's been in a

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
dominant position in tech

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
because of factors that i can't control

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
when i finally absorb this

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
it really made all the difference white

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
males like me don't

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,839
lose by paying things forward lending a

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
hand and advocating for others

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
is not a zero-sum game and finally being

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,000
vulnerable doesn't make you weak

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,079
it makes you a better employee a better

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
partner a better parent and quite

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,000
honestly just a better human

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,760
my hope is that you all join me in

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,519
helping advance the cause of diversity

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,959
and inclusion so that one day

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,800
we don't have to give talks like this

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,800
one thank you everybody

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,320
that was great thank you now if you

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,959
would stick around

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,880
until susan is done so that we can do

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,160
the q and a together we do have one

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,360
question already

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,560
susan if i could get you to um d cloak

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,399
again and um guy you're going to cloak

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
up for a minute while we get susan's

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,160
perspective

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,040
and then we will remate for a wrap-up in

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
the questions okay

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
all right well hi everyone i'm susan

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,160
wans

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,040
um i get to follow that so yay

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,839
so um a little bit about me i am the

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
founder of

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,560
a women in tech group here in raleigh

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,600
durham called women and tech allies

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,160
we are a group of people all

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,160
genders backgrounds all different parts

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,720
of the software development life cycle

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,440
all different skill sets ages who come

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,920
together

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,959
to create programming around making

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,920
tech a more diverse and inclusive space

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,480
so i guess that's why i'm talking about

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,920
this

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,800
today um during the day i'm a full stock

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,600
full stock developer i work with a

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,680
couple different startups

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,279
and i really just enjoy coding and being

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
a developer

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
but i did not take a traditional path

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
into technology i

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
actually did not go through a computer

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,240
science program

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
i was a behavioral neuroscience major

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
and then i went off and i did a whole

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,240
bunch of other stuff and i was in uh

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
construction project management for 12

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,160
years so that really you know

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
that screams uh excellent software

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
developer right

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,600
um but i hit a glass ceiling and i

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,519
decided to pivot

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
and i basically turned my life upside

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,360
down moved my

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,360
family and my four-year-old to texas

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
went through a boot camp to learn how to

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
code

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,279
lived in hotel for 90 days racked up a

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,959
huge amount of debt doing it

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,120
but made it into a new career and

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,760
so a lot of people are like that's crazy

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,240
why would you do something like that

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,240
but now i'm a software developer um

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
what's what's interesting to me is and i

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
made that journey probably about eight

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
years ago now

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
um but at the time there are a lot

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,120
there's and and still

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600
there's a lot of news a lot of um you

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
know

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
companies talking about how they need

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
techno tech talent

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
how you know they really need more

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
people to get interested in technology

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,959
but it's interesting because i i was a

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
boot camp graduate i've talked to a lot

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,320
of boot camp graduates and people who

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,040
have tried to self-teach

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
themselves or go through you know

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,600
programs to try to

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,760
to convert into someone who's you know

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,040
skilled enough to get a job in tech

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,560
and it's not that easy

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,040
um companies and the tech industry as a

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,240
whole

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,320
is is not as welcoming

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
and not as open to people from

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
non-traditional

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,519
paths into tech as you would think they

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,880
would be based upon

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,360
how much demand they say they have um

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,720
and so it's interesting because people

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
will be like well that's you know that's

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,680
a very non-traditional path

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,800
into tech but really it's not

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,399
it's the first path that there was

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,639
into being a developer okay

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,480
so a little bit more about my history

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,079
and how this applies is that

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
my parents actually met in a coding boot

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,320
camp

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,040
oh in 1980

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
i want to say they probably my parents

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,839
met

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,320
i was my stepdad and my mom so they met

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,360
probably around 1981 1982

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,040
in a boot camp at the time software

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
development was a brand new thing

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,399
there was no such thing as computer

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
science really uh

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,800
for you know producing programmers at

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,880
that point

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,040
and the way that people became

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
programmers was that companies major

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,440
companies

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,120
insurance companies banks airlines

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,519
you know your major companies that were

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,440
just starting to adopt computers

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,519
as this new technology that was going to

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,519
like revolutionize their industry

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,000
they all needed programmers and there

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,800
weren't programmers they didn't exist

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
okay so what did industry do well most

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
of those companies

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
created boot camps they created training

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
programs

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,639
they hired people who had aptitude they

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,120
tested them for things like

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,120
uh logic tests and you know other kinds

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,959
of aptitude tests to see if this kind of

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,360
if they had the type of thinking

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
and thought process and interest and

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,280
ability to learn

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,799
that they could grow into and be

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,799
developed into

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,000
a programmer so both of my parents

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,760
they didn't have computer science

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,039
degrees either because that nobody had

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,799
computer science degrees who were

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,679
developers 40 years ago

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,880
um they had my mom was pre-med pre-law

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,000
she was a black woman

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,760
in tech in the early 80s okay so talk

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
about trailblazer right

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,160
my dad was a history major and a navy

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,880
veteran

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,520
okay so again another uh if you want to

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,000
talk about

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,120
being a diverse group that's how you got

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,440
a diverse group

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
and at the time women were like almost

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,120
40 percent

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
of programmers now we're down to about

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
20.

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
so apparently that system worked really

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,080
well for getting people in

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
um and that was at a time too if you

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
think about it

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
in late 70s early 80s we were still

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,799
ramping up women's involvement

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,679
in the workplace at all let alone

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,640
having 40 percent representation in a

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,679
particular field in a high-tech field

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,080
so the benefit

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,000
of that type of system and when

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
companies had that kind of system and

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,640
they

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
they they brought people in they paid

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
them

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
okay to learn and taught them exactly

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
the tech stack

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
that they needed which at the time tech

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,720
stacks were kind of

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,400
interesting i mean they had punch cards

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
in that class so tech stack was kind of

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,360
like a stack of cards i guess

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,360
but assembly language you know the very

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,240
beginnings of programming they taught

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,640
these people

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,880
you know how to do it and what was great

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,200
is there was such

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
loyalty among the people who were taught

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
and trained that way

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
they stayed with their companies for 10

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,120
15 years because

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
they felt like the company invested in

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
them

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,760
and they invested back in their company

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
so if you're if you're working at a

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
company or you're doing hr and you have

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,400
people bouncing every two years

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
maybe investment in them is the way to

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,799
stop doing that

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,000
um but what happened everyone

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
you know everyone wonders what what

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
happened if we started that way how did

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,320
we end up

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,640
where we are now and the the way we did

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,440
that

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,360
is that companies decided it was better

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,160
for their bottom line

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,400
to shift that responsibility of learning

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,799
to the employees

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
okay and so when they ended a lot of

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,000
these boot camp programs and they

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
shifted their focus to encouraging

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,120
colleges and universities

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,360
to train people in software development

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
and therefore computer science programs

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,720
were developed

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
and academia decided that the best place

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,720
to put this

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,200
was in engineering okay now nothing

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,320
against

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,000
engineering as a field but

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,440
uh they have a different thought process

00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,480
in how they learn okay and

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,159
um you know i as

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
i don't know if anyone who has been

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,120
through computer science

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,880
if you've ever heard of a weed out class

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,880
okay i'm going to read you a little

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,240
quote about a weed outcrass

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,080
class someone who was went through

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,400
engineering at my flagship

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,400
university about 30 years ago the

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
engineering weed out rate was well over

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
50 percent

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,440
given the talent of some that still

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,720
graduated i think they

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:31,840
may have still set the bar a bit too low

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:36,320
okay so the idea of an engineering class

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:39,520
um actually wanting to weed people out

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,880
that thought process um

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,000
has kind of continued on and been

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,720
adopted into our corporate

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
culture now when it comes to computers

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,360
and

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,720
computer science and your i.t

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,200
departments

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,559
and you know this weed out type of

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,799
mentality shows up

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,679
in a lot of different ways it shows up

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,799
in

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,000
job descriptions it shows up in the

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,520
hiring process for technology

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,840
it shows up in code challenges it shows

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,240
up

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,159
in in how tech tends to conduct itself

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
especially when it comes to developers

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,720
and things like that

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,520
so you know and and the assumption

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,480
is that people drop out or are weeded

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
out because

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,720
they're not intelligent enough to handle

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,080
it or anything like that

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,240
and really it's more than that um

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,400
it's not bad at all i mean a lot of the

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
people who leave they don't go and like

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
decide to take up underwater basket

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,679
weaving

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
okay they leave and they go into pre-med

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
they go into

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,720
other sciences so these people are

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,080
intelligent

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,559
but they're coming from a place where

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,240
this kind of mentality of not being

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,240
inclusive even in schools

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
kind of affects them in a more more

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
profound way

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,840
so like for example if you're the one of

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
the few women in an engineering program

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,840
and you hit one of these uh weed out

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,679
classes most of these

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
groups they start to form student groups

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
and they study with each other and they

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,000
help each other

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
when you're the only woman in the class

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
and you go and ask a guy hey do you want

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,440
to study together

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,280
that's not the same conversation okay

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
that there's some societal uh

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,600
issues that pop up where maybe your

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,960
invitation is taken to be a little bit

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,400
more than what you

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,919
wanted it to be um if you are showing up

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
to college and you're the first one in

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,400
your family to go to college and you're

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,760
on a

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,679
scholarship and you know your gpa

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,480
drops below a certain point and you're

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,440
out you're not going to take that chance

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,440
on too many weed out classes bumping you

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,799
completely out of the opportunity to

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
graduate from college

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,320
you're going to switch into a major that

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,799
is

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,080
welcoming to you that is interested in

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,720
having you there

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
okay so it's not just they weren't smart

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
enough to handle it and that's kind of

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,039
the attitude

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,200
that sometimes gets carried over okay

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,440
so you know

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
are there certain coding jobs that

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
require computer science degree well

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,679
yeah i guess if you're launching someone

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,080
into space or you're

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,080
you know programming a weapons program

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,240
yeah okay you might need that

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,919
but if you're doing the the amount of

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,559
the explosion

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
in what we have in terms of technology

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,960
e-commerce

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,200
online learning uh you know cms

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,120
and systems i mean there there's so many

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
i mean it's

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,200
there's no bounds everything especially

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
now that we see with kovid

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
everything is online everything is in

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,000
technology now

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
we need so many more people to come into

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,360
this industry

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,039
and we need that growth to be diverse to

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,679
have different schools of thought

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,039
to be an opportunity for all different

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
people and not just

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,840
one group of people to be able to

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,400
benefit from the explosion that we have

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,200
that in order to do that we have to lose

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,039
this idea of trying to weed people out

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,480
okay um the idea of

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,840
instead what we started with which was

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,039
looking for potential okay seeking

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,320
potential

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,360
in people um

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,520
how how do we we switch this okay so for

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,760
example i talked about hiring practices

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,480
so let's look at job descriptions

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,080
um if you work at a company and you look

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
at your careers page

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,520
and all of your job descriptions that

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
have to do with development

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,960
list right off the bat computer science

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,320
degree or other

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,559
uh required you've just eliminated

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,320
everyone who comes from a

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,360
non-traditional role

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,679
okay when you sit there and put um how

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,000
many years of a particular

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
um skill they need you've started to

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,520
eliminate and weed out

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,799
people what if you have somebody who is

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,279
just a savant

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,320
and they have taught themselves you know

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,120
devops

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,520
and they are amazing and they've been

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,679
doing it extensively for three years

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
just really digging in you just ruled

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,039
them out because you said you want seven

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,720
or seven to ten years

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,720
that's it okay um so

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,240
if you shift job descriptions to

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,039
actually list

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,960
what are the actual skills that are must

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,919
have for this position day one

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,880
the day they walk in the door and then

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,039
what is

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,559
the rest of the stack that you're hoping

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,000
they'll want to learn

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,679
over once they're in okay

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
that kind of job description leaves

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,240
things more open

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,360
for different people who have skill sets

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
that

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,960
could be a perfect fit for what you're

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,000
looking for okay

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,760
um code challenges okay

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,240
the number of code challenges that i

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,960
have done that have absolutely nothing

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,000
not even close to relating to the role

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,200
that i'm actually

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
applying for was in sayings particularly

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
coming out of the boot camp

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
it's like they see that you came out of

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
a boot camp and you didn't go through a

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
computer science program

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,880
and it's like they go into their closet

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,320
find their computer science book

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
dust it off turn to a page somewhere and

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
pull

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,640
a question out just to stump you just to

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
let you know that

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
you don't know what i know and it's like

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
no i don't know what you know

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,279
but i have 12 years of experience in the

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,279
real world

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,279
and i went through a boot camp and

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,240
changed flipped my life over for this

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
opportunity

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,159
and you're ruling me out based upon a

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
question on page 67 of your computer

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,799
science book

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,400
that you haven't even looked at since

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,400
you were in college

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,799
okay so you know having

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,159
being cautious of who you allow to do

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,760
code challenges

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
what kind of code challenges are they

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,480
doing do they actually relate to the

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,679
to the job that's being applied for um

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,559
you know not doing whiteboard stuff

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
because ew you know give them something

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,240
to do let them go do it

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,919
and let them bring it back you know no

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,960
one needs to be sitting there on a hot

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,320
seat

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,440
that's not that's that's rude you know

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
um there's lots of different ways that

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,520
this can apply

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,399
it also applies to your internal

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,399
environment

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,440
when you do hire people so you know

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:32,000
if you're a senior right now

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,760
who are you mentoring who are you

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,159
growing and developing

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,960
a lot of times senior at this point is

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,600
just

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,200
the pay scale that you're on or maybe

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
the years that you've been in and the

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
things that you've seen

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,440
but if you're a senior i challenge you

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,679
to make sure that your senior title

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,440
also means that you're developing people

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,880
that you're mentoring people

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,320
that you know your code reviews or your

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,240
um you know yearly reviews of people

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,760
actually are designed to help grow them

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,960
um and help them get better

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,120
and as as companies if they're

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,960
you really do notice the companies that

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,919
that take the time

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,200
to hire junior people higher mid-level

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,320
people

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,679
rather than trying to

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,559
find the perfect fit for the guy who's

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,360
leaving

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,039
who grew into that role over 10 years

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
you expect someone to come in right off

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,919
the bat know everything that he knew

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,200
just you know um the people who the the

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,919
companies that actually

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
commit to growing and developing and

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
training

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,520
people into a role have so much more

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,919
longevity in their staff

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,240
they have so many so much more loyalty

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,760
for the people who work there

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
and they also have a tendency to have

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,600
much more diverse and much more

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,799
inclusive environments

00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,399
so um if we can replace

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,720
that weed out culture with

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,080
a desire to find potential in people and

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,320
develop it

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,840
it's better for our whole industry it's

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,480
better for companies

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,000
and it's definitely better for diversity

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,799
and inclusion

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,799
so that's what i've got

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,320
thank you lots to think of there so now

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,720
guy if i could get you to rejoin there

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,120
you are

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,559
life is good okay um

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,240
so looking for looking for a lot of

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,320
support for what you had to say in the

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,640
comments i'm going to start

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,399
with the question that was queued up for

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
us originally

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,480
by ricky which wasn't addressed in the

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,679
last session so i'll read you this

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
because it's a bit long

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,200
one question that didn't get answered in

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,200
clarence and corn session would be

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,039
a good discussion in the wrap up when

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,080
you're the only in the room

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,679
quote-unquote only in the room how do

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,200
you handle microaggressions in the

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,360
moment

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,279
i feel supported by my management can

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
take it up with superiors afterwards

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,320
do you have any tips for the in the

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,480
moment

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
how to identify respond to those kinds

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,480
of microaggressions

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,360
and and how to not second-guess yourself

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,440
or freeze

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,440
and what's the role of the ally in that

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,960
to me yeah you can go first okay

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:34,320
um micro regressions well i

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,320
i think that a lot of the time

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,679
i like context a little bit um

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,080
you know i find that it depends on

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,760
a little bit more on the context if i am

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,200
in a situation where i feel like there's

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,240
a microaggression going on and it's

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
directed at me

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,919
i look at do i think

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,960
based upon my background of this person

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,559
that perhaps it's unintentional

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,159
or do i think that um

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,200
it's maybe more than that okay

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,039
if i think it's more than that

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,360
i will actually say something at the

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,880
time but that's kind of me

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,120
you know not everybody's that brave

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
right um if i think that it's directed

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,039
towards some other person

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,919
i will find a way to support them in

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,360
that moment

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,480
so um i it's easier with an example like

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,000
somebody

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,000
um one that i often talk about is

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
repeating what somebody else said and

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
giving them attribution

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,279
for example like somebody is in a

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,600
meeting and they they

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,559
take off on somebody's point and like

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
they almost own

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,640
what somebody else's idea and and saying

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,440
you know what that's a great point

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,120
when mary said it and she talked about

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,960
blah blah blah that was really great

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,159
mary can you expand upon that

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,000
a little bit like redirecting being

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,840
aware what's going on

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,360
if i feel that it's something directed

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,919
towards me

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,399
and i don't think it's really purposeful

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,960
i usually try to just kind of make a

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
note

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,200
and i'll go and talk to that person

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,880
outside i don't necessarily feel like

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
calling people on the carpet at the

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,279
moment

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,559
if it's not intentional is the best

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,799
policy

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,399
but sometimes you gotta do what you

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,919
gotta do

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,440
but guy what do you think uh no i'm just

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,960
nodding because that's exactly

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,399
what i would have answered usually it's

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,799
not best to follow him on the carpet

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,640
because

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,240
it's not as productive as going to them

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
separately but yeah there are times

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,799
where when

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,399
you need to amplify somebody's point and

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
and actually give them attribution so

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,399
that people know okay wait a minute that

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
that

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,960
that went on

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,080
yeah i've had i've had uh taking it back

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,279
channel

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,120
blow up on me as well though right that

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,080
that same person that gave you that hard

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,159
time that day

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,840
i did that to me when i tried to have a

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,799
conversation with her about how

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,360
something had gone off the rails and she

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,120
felt

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,880
singled out so it's it's a it's a fine

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,000
line i think

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,760
in general i

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,600
you know you don't want to be that

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
person who's forever nailing every

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,679
single

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
person you're doing it now and now

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,320
you're doing it over here and all that

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,720
but at the same time as an ally i think

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,919
we have a unique position if we hear it

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,919
happening if we see

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
the person caving in the corner because

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,080
they're feeling it

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,760
to step in between and say by the way i

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
see what you're doing to this person

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,159
here

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,159
whether you realize it or not right i

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
think that and i liked your style on the

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,399
whole

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,840
let me restate that and point out that

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,960
she said it first

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,080
you know right that's a great trick

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,240
um okay we have a question here about

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,559
asking you to share an instance of being

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,279
an la a specific instance guy

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,519
when you got to when you got to do that

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
uh well okay i have a couple but i think

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,039
one of them you saw in the in the second

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,120
video clip so i was mod

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,240
i got to moderate a panel at an autodesk

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,080
internal event that was

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,039
all about showcasing um women engineers

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
and actually one

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,240
one trans engineer and and basically

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,640
highlighting what they had to say

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,200
because

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,079
they were never given you know direct

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,760
access to

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,919
show everybody else in the company sort

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,280
of the perspective they had and the

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,280
value that they had and i loved

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,800
being able to do that i got that on the

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,240
on the uh on the

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
conference program and was able to

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,040
moderate it and uh fantastic

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
love doing that

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,440
cool thank you um okay here's somebody

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,040
talking about weed out challenges and

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,440
i would like to say something about this

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
whole topic of weeding out

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,560
um but this is a person who's got some

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,599
empathy for the weeders so

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,159
let me say that the there's no weeding

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,399
out like

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,399
law school waiting out right there's a

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,040
whole year of hazing

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
to force the people that aren't up to

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,200
the job

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,399
out even though they're not actually

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,000
learning about their job they're just

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,040
learning about their profession and the

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
extent to which

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,680
everybody's on everybody else's throats

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,480
and i'm not convinced that it's making

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,359
the law a better place to work or live

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,640
right

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,480
um that hyper competitiveness thing

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,079
so we've gotten past the point of trying

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,440
to figure out what the lies to some

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,760
other thing

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,520
um where we make movies about it and we

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,400
you know it's it's it's gotten pretty

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
sick

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,640
but back in the day i think it was an

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
attempt to

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,880
find the best single contributor as

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,359
opposed to collaborative contributor

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
and i think that we may have seen a c c

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,920
change

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,520
um thanks to open source and some other

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,440
things where we're starting to realize

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,359
that those individual contributors

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,720
it's kind of like the genius

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,520
myth but applied to a whole profession

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,640
like we we maybe need to reward

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,359
collaboration

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,680
instead of instead of winnowing out i

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,440
mean

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,280
we do this in data instead of being

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,040
reductionist we're trying to look at

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,720
all the data now and come up with a

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
synergistic model that works more like

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,359
the way the human brain works right

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,000
so why can't we do that in hiring now

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,800
this person

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,880
is saying i feel like weed out

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,520
challenges and strict job requirements

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,200
come from a place of almost desperation

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,119
to find some way of narrowing down

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,800
sometimes hundreds of applicants

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,040
especially for junior entry-level

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,599
positions is there a right way to do

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,800
that

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,680
candidate search and how does one self

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,599
how does one sell removing weed out to a

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,440
team when it sounds like a huge resource

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,800
cost

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,920
all right well um

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,640
one i would say that

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,079
it's very i would not say that it is the

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,280
norm

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,200
for um

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
companies to get hundreds and hundreds

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,960
of applicants

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,560
um there are certain companies i'm sure

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
they get tons of them if you're google

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,720
or aws or ibm

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,480
maybe you get hundreds and hundreds of

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,599
you know people trying to apply straight

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,280
out of school

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,720
what i see from um

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,520
our sponsors our sponsor companies i see

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,520
you know a laundry they usually have a

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,240
list of careers that they have

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,880
open and available are a mile long and

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,160
they can't get anyone to apply

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,160
um so

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,760
you know i think that maybe that whole

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,720
weeding out idea is a little different

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,880
if you're in

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,200
a um in a particular company where you

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,119
are

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,480
actually getting hundreds and hundreds

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,839
of junior applicants

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,800
okay my answer to that would be perhaps

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,599
your company

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,280
needs to initiate some kind of

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,320
internship program or

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
path that is more specifically geared

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000
towards

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,640
your entry level and junior positions so

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,680
that

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,599
you can you can be a little bit

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,880
more open with the process than

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,680
constantly you know declining or pushing

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,119
out

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,960
okay um be a little bit more creative

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,760
about how you're bringing in new people

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
um rather than just kind of you know

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,800
scaring people away

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
and having them run for that i still

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,960
think that's the secret design of

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,720
summer of code actually at the time the

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,200
summer of code came out

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,000
google was going to every conference to

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,920
hire

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
like straight-up recruiters in every

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
booth you know

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,240
taking your name and seeing if you

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,359
wanted to have a conversation

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,320
and and summer of code is almost like a

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,599
like a mini internship it's like a

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,280
remote internship

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,440
right where they could see how people

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,000
adapt to working in the way that google

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
was working

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,520
i thought it was a pretty clever hack

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,880
because they they simultaneously got all

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,040
kinds of props for being good open

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,079
source citizens right

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,640
so okay here's one

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
um i understood that the purpose of code

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
challenges and whiteboard challenges are

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,520
to see how a candidate goes through the

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,359
process of problem solving

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,480
what might be a more comfortable or

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,920
respectful alternative

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,119
okay whiteboard challenges whiteboard

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
challenges

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
yes i understand you want to see how

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,839
this person thinks

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,440
okay not every personality type

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,640
is really encouraged by that kind of

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,720
environment

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,079
okay i for example um believe it or not

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,839
even though i'm sitting here speaking

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,680
i'm quite the introvert

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,640
okay and um when i

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,920
have a tendency to start trying to think

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,440
through a problem

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,880
i get very like focused and i tend to

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,560
drown everything out

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,079
and i kind of focus in on the problem

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,680
and i and i go through a lot of thought

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,359
process and that

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,200
um doesn't really work well with

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,599
whiteboarding however

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,280
a lot of those same companies that rely

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,680
heavily on whiteboarding would probably

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
really

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,280
appreciate my skill set because i'm

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:52,400
highly skilled at a lot of things

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:56,800
okay um i think that

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,839
there's this tendency in in

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,119
hiring okay to

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,720
apply what works for you

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,560
to other people to

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,880
think that well i'm looking for somebody

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,960
who's good at what i do

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,720
and relates to things the way that i do

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,079
in order to for them to be proficient

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,079
okay and

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,400
i think that if you're going to have a

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
team

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
where there's a lot of different types

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,640
of thinkers a lot of different types of

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
people that interact with things in very

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
different ways

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,720
you're going to need people who are

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,319
different than you

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,920
so if you're really comfortable on a

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,560
whiteboard great

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,280
only for you but you're passing up a lot

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,280
of talent that just really frankly isn't

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,960
that's gonna sit there and go okay

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,400
normally i would have

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,079
first of all i wouldn't be incredibly

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,839
nervous uh

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,200
two i wouldn't be sitting there thinking

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,920
oh my gosh what happens if i don't get

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,720
this job

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,280
right i've got kids to feed and a

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,680
mortgage

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,760
right the process of getting a job is

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,160
very stressful for a lot of people

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,319
and so when you put them even more in a

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,680
stressful situation than expect them to

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,520
think

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,040
uh in the way that you would think

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,240
through it

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:20,560
is it's not really super

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,680
fun or welcoming okay

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,599
great okay we have a question can we

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,680
further discuss the challenge of being

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,920
an ally for a group of which you are not

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,680
apart there's a big risk of seeming

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,560
insincere or out of touch or not

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,240
trustworthy

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,720
is there a best practice for avoiding

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,880
giving the wrong impression

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,040
so denise already probably knows i'm

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,280
going to answer this question which is

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,400
it doesn't start there it starts with

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,920
how you

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,000
how you are what kind of a person you

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,520
are and you have to earn that

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,920
quite also you have to earn that right

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,079
to to be an advocate

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,359
and so you know what i said in the video

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,480
i sat in that meeting

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,079
and i didn't say anything i mean

00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,680
honestly i wasn't going to say anything

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,240
and then i was asked a direct question

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
say

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,960
please address this because i was there

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
until my before and i was there to

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,800
listen

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,000
uh to figure out sort of what i could do

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,079
and i think that's a really really

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,359
important thing is just to is just to be

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,079
there to be present

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,000
to listen and and and honestly to to be

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,400
consistent in how you sort of approach

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,839
this from a humility standpoint um and

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,079
he knows this

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,760
remembering me for a long time that that

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,280
i i am who i am both

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,319
kind of in the community and outside of

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,520
the community and i think it's really

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,319
important to make sure you have that

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,640
consistent thing yeah

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,400
i usually find actually it's it's easier

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
to advocate for a group that you're not

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,160
a part of

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,200
because it seems less it comes across a

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,480
lot of the time it's less

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,200
self-serving um so

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,119
you know i as a black female if i'm an

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,800
environment where i feel like

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,319
someone who is um lgbtq

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,240
is getting not what they

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,480
with a treatment that they shouldn't be

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,280
being able to step in and say

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,400
um you know what we're doing here that's

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,520
not working

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,000
you know um it's easier

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,359
i find it easier to kind of celebrate

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,400
the successes of

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,599
or highlight the attributes of

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,119
people who are also marginalized but not

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,440
marginalized in the same way that i

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,839
am uh if that makes sense so

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,880
you know or not i'm not in that position

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,720
at that time

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,480
new mothers i remember we had an issue

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,200
with like new moms coming back to the

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,200
office

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,480
and there was like no lactation room and

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,000
no support for

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,000
you know a lot of the things they needed

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,560
coming back and i could understand their

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,960
position

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,880
i wasn't in that position at the time so

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,720
i felt like it was easier for me

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,560
to be able to advocate for that and kind

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,640
of like go to bat like ah

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,680
no this is this is not how we're gonna

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,640
do things

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,520
um so i think i think you can see it as

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,560
a plus

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,640
you can see it as a plus as well

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,720
yeah i would like to share an ally story

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,160
that's a really simple one that anybody

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,480
can do which is um noticing people who

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,720
are sitting by themselves

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,960
and looking out of out of place and

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,720
especially around a conference table go

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,920
sit next to them

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,480
you know and and and include them even

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,720
just with your physical presence because

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,800
uh it's really hard being feeling

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,440
different in a room

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,560
and um it's a great thing to feel like

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,920
there's somebody there with you

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,319
especially if you're scared

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,839
right that's a good thing um about

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,760
weeding out

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,720
my best hiring endeavors and i've done a

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,160
lot of hiring

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,240
right are where my

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,480
top three candidates all make it into

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,400
the company eventually

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,920
and i have to say you know i can't hire

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,599
you right now but i really want to so

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,760
i'm going to stay in touch with you

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,720
and and you know they've only given me

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,800
this much

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
money and i only have room for one but

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,280
i'm going to get more in

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
next quarter and i really want to call

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,359
you those have been really successful

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,160
for me um there is a person here still

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,160
worried about

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,319
what to do about the weeding out and

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,560
specifically justifying

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,319
uh reducing that a little bit in their

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,079
hiring practice

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,920
and i think that this is a real problem

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,760
because we're simultaneously

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,200
told we have to have diverse hiring

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,480
panels and diverse candidate panels

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
to tick some box about we we didn't only

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,839
just hire the person that looked like us

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,599
except that it always ends up that way

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,560
anyway you know so

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,240
maybe there's a way to do it that's more

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,240
like the orchestra thing where

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,280
where it's a blind at least up to a

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,880
certain point

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,200
they don't know what you look like or

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,839
who you are they just see your talent

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,160
um at wikipedia we used to and this is

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,200
not something everybody can do but

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,040
we used to give challenges that we were

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,520
actually facing real world problems

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,640
that we needed to solve out as sort of

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,319
homework

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,160
and then we'd look at that's how we

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,680
figured out how people think was looking

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,079
at the work that they went through

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,440
we'd like to see your notes but you can

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,280
use the internet you can use anything

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,400
you'd be using in a normal day and what

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,359
we're looking for is your problem

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,000
solving to so

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,359
tell them that up front and um some

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
people hated it and felt like they were

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,119
being asked to do free work but it was

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,640
wikipedia so it's kind of implicitly

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,920
like that anyway

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,000
um that was a really good way to ferret

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,440
out who was more creative without

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,599
thinking too much about what they look

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,480
like

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,880
right okay let's see um what are some

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
ways

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,920
of setting an example to help other

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,920
people become better allies

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,440
i think the question was besides setting

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,240
an example and i actually like that

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,560
question because

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,880
it it it goes to something that i've

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,040
always thought about this which is that

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,119
reaching out and having a conversation

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,040
with somebody especially you know

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,800
male 1 male 1 tech to another male tech

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,720
to say hey you have something to offer

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,079
and kind of working with them

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,520
individually to say hey

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,800
i think you'd be a great mentor for this

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,240
group or i think you have something to

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,160
offer in this context

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,760
uh is to me much better than just saying

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,920
okay hey let's follow

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,200
you know great male allies whoever they

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,720
are let's follow their example but

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,560
actually having that conversation

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,040
and making it a personal connection is

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,960
really important

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,400
yeah i think that's great advice do you

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,280
have something susan

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,000
you know we we have a lot of of male

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,440
allies

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,720
in women and tech allies and um

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,720
i think that a lot of the time

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,960
there are people there are people that

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,359
are interested in being allies but

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,599
they're not sure exactly what to do

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,559
like okay great i want to be an ally now

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:42,319
what you know right

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,720
um i think that it even just presenting

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,599
them

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,920
with opportunities to be an ally or to

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,559
get

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
involved can really help um and some of

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,160
the things that we've done

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,119
is just having networking events

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,920
honestly

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,520
being the type of person who you know

00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,920
everyone has worked somewhere where the

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,520
hr person has come out and said hey

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,599
we have a couple of new physicians

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,839
coming open do you know anybody

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,599
right and what ends up happening is you

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,079
end up recommending the people that you

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,119
know

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,280
and if all the people that you know look

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,559
or come from the exact same background

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,280
that you have

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,079
then you know we're going to remain

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,200
homogeneous

00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,760
right um so just getting the opportunity

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,760
to

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,839
network with people who maybe come from

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,040
a different background than you do

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,640
um that right there is great um we also

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,640
have opportunities where we have

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,720
mentorship programs that we try to

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,119
set up and hook people up with mentors

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,760
we have opportunities for them to come

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,200
and teach

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,680
on a topic that maybe they're still for

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,200
you

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,480
people uh so few diverse people

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,440
who even are working in that particular

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,680
area

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,599
in our area that we can't even find

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,119
anyone to talk about it and they'll come

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,520
and say you know what

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,880
uh i may you know not fit the bill for

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,440
being diverse but

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
i would love to teach some more so that

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,640
they're

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,800
next time there is somebody right or to

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,480
spark an interest in that direction

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,520
um you know offering the opportunity

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,839
for people to um

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,000
run an internship program or you know

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,839
there there's a lot of different places

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,040
where if they knew how to get involved

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,119
they probably would yeah

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,800
i i have one more that it's not you

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,000
can't always arrange to do it but if you

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,839
can it's really interesting

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,480
try working in a company where um

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,119
the pro the normal privileged culture is

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,079
not

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,480
in the majority and see what that feels

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,040
like

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,640
you'll learn a lot about how what's

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,480
needed right

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,000
just putting yourself in that situation

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,599
for a little while which i did

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,119
inadvertently at paypal

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,800
but they're 65 southeast asian and so

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,480
all of these systems we're talking about

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,319
we're biased in the direction of more

00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,960
people that look like them

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,800
and it was fascinating it was very

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,480
interesting

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,839
so can i say one more thing about

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,119
weeding out because we did get a couple

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,760
of questions there and i think

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,559
just a general answer to some of that

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,240
yeah of course

00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,200
when i say weeding out to i don't want

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,319
you

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,800
to necessarily focus on specific

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,319
practices like we can't give code

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
challenges now because it's a weeding

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,000
out practice

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,240
or we can't have good job descriptions

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,599
because it's a weeding out process

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,520
it's more of a thought shift than it is

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,240
purely a practice okay if the purpose of

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
your code

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,200
challenge and your process around it is

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,880
specifically designed

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,680
to try to bring out the potential in the

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,960
person

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,640
that is applying that is different than

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,920
to weed out the person that is applying

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:59,200
if your job description is created

00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,800
specifically to prevent people and put a

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,880
wall up

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,920
versus trying to draw out the interest

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,440
and eagerness or excitement about a

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,480
particular technology

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,640
or whatever from a person

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,800
then that's the shift that i'm asking

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,720
you to make it's more mental

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
than anything else and the process

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,760
follows

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,079
is that i don't know if that makes some

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,480
more sense that totally makes sense

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,160
i remember how revolutionary google's

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,359
job postings felt when they first

00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
started doing them

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,760
because it sounded like it was going to

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,960
be fun you know right

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,880
gets you excited exactly yeah i can see

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,640
that i can totally see that

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,400
yeah susan so you're one of your points

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,520
about kind of the what it's like when

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,720
you're sitting there and you're being

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,319
asked to do it right there

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,480
uh i actually at one point interviewed

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,920
for a job at indeed and they had a great

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,920
way of looking at this which was that

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,920
they gave you the code

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,760
project to work on before you came to

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,359
the interview and so you had a chance to

00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,440
sit there and kind of work through it

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,200
and they were very intentional about not

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,040
it not being weeding out but wanting

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,319
you to write the code they had some of

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,760
it written and then wanting you to come

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,040
and explain what your thought processes

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,720
were how you got there which i

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,319
liked because it was less about oh we're

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,680
trying to weed you out on the spot by

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,680
making you do this like

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,200
okay you know i can remember my data

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,800
specter's algorithm class right but it's

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,160
more oh i have the chance to look at it

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,599
and sort of work through it i thought

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,680
that was a really good approach

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:29,920
that's excellent that's exactly right

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:29,920
