Abstract: A common misperception is that you need a college degree in a science or technical major to start a career in technology. This is not always the path to follow because taking on that financial debt is a hindrance before you even start your career. There are so many ways to prepare for a career in technology, no two are the same. In this talk, Johnny and Jason will discuss the unique challenges underrepresented groups face. They will go in depth on ways to overcome the biases, generalizations and prejudices that minorities encounter when they’re trying to get an opportunity in the technology industry. They’ll also discuss a few unconventional ways to level up the necessary skills so people in these communities can get the career they want.
