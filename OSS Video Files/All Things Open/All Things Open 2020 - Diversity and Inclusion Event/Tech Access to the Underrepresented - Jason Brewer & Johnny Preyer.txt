Title: Tech Access to the Underrepresented - Jason Brewer & Johnny Preyer
Publication date: 2020-12-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Diversity and Inclusion Event
Description: 
	Presented by: Jason Brewer & Johnny Preyer, Mailchimp
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Inclusion and Diversity event

Abstract: A common misperception is that you need a college degree in a science or technical major to start a career in technology. This is not always the path to follow because taking on that financial debt is a hindrance before you even start your career. There are so many ways to prepare for a career in technology, no two are the same. In this talk, Johnny and Jason will discuss the unique challenges underrepresented groups face. They will go in depth on ways to overcome the biases, generalizations and prejudices that minorities encounter when they’re trying to get an opportunity in the technology industry. They’ll also discuss a few unconventional ways to level up the necessary skills so people in these communities can get the career they want.

trying to provide an opportunity to the

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,000
underrepresented

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,280
it's a working title this story takes

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
place a long

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,560
long ago before the times of tick tock

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,000
facebook and my thinning hair

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,080
google had just gone public in 2004

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and i just bought my first condo

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
the acme corp which i work for at the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
time

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,760
was that was near the cnn center in

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
centennial olympic park

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,720
in downtown atlanta georgia our office

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
was on the fifth floor

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
and the data center was on the fourth

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,840
directly below us

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,560
i was sitting in a dark lit i.t room

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,400
facing a white parking deck

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
this is where we house all of our it

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
hardware

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,080
i was building linux servers so that

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,920
they can be racked and stacked

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
directly below me in our data center

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
these servers would house our new

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,239
ticketing system

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
while i was waiting for that progress

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
bar to slowly

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,159
move across the screen i noticed to the

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
side of me

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,799
a pile of hp desktops that just had been

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,799
pulled from the office floor

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,840
and were deemed for a recycle

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
they were still in good condition

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
and were scheduled to be picked up by a

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,959
third-party vendor

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,519
who bought end-of-life hardware

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,200
the desktop life cycle at acme corp was

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,239
three years old

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,720
is three years old for a computer

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
my daughter who plays roblox on a decade

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
old core 2

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,080
duo would disagree but what should i do

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,840
with them

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
and how can i use them to make a

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
difference

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,879
i was about to get married to my best

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,159
friend and my mom suggested we get

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,879
marriage counseling

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,120
at at the african methodist episcopal

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,079
church

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,000
i had fond memories of every sunday

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
morning

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
the music was fantastic but i also had

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
nightmares

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
of my mom pinching me as i nodded off to

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,240
the word

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,320
times had changed and my fiance we were

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
a little leery of organized religion

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,120
because well

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
they weren't accepting of everyone

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,040
we decided to give it a shot anyway

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,960
because mama knows

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,759
we we met the most amazing pastor

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,240
she was open-minded caring and very

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
thoughtful

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
to this day i call her my spiritual

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
north star

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,080
she always pushes me to make a change

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,520
for others because i

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,240
am so blessed this was inspiring and

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
felt

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
fell right in line with how i felt about

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,720
technology

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,160
the way it could impact an individual a

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
family

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
even a community no longer

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
did you need the financial means to

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,000
afford an expensive college degree

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,280
to create an opportunity

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,400
with just a computer the right attitude

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
and aptitude an impactful change could

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
occur

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
it could be seismic

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,759
computers are what i needed and i knew

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
exactly where to get them

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,320
the only hurdle i had to overcome was

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,520
convincing an executive to donate

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,880
computers to my church

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,440
i convinced myself that monday would be

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
the day

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,840
i walked into his office and made that

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
request

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
monday morning came i stepped off the

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
elevator

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,600
onto the fifth floor and walked into the

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,319
lobby

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
i scanned my badge and stared at the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,520
office's

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,280
faded blue carpet as i walked down the

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,720
corridor of gray cubicles

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,199
to my desk i sat down

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
at my desk holding on to my book bag

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
like a life preserver

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,080
i felt like i was drowning what would i

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,560
say to the big boss man

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,280
that day my productivity it was

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
non-existent

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
i could feel the butterflies in my

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,919
stomach and my hands started to shake in

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,319
anticipation

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,000
there was no backing out now i got up

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,880
walked down what felt like an endless

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,680
hallway to his office

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,919
the door was open but i still knocked on

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,599
the metal frame

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,720
the boss man looked up he greeted me

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,160
and invited me into his office

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,840
i took the biggest breath

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
and i started into my pitch

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,520
what seemed like eternity was open

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,840
was over in five minutes without even

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
hesitating he granted my request

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,160
and donated the computers to the church

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,599
success

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,240
or so i thought i delivered

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
the computers to the church that evening

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
i talked to my pastor and she thought it

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
was a great idea

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
the only part that was actually missing

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,280
was a plan

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,280
how could i turn this half-baked idea

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
into a life-changing opportunity for

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
someone

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,319
i wasn't prepared for the challenge of

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,479
challenges of getting someone to believe

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,039
that they could overcome the challenges

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,840
life had put in front of them

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,039
johnny and i have been passionate about

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,919
making a difference

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,879
in these communities we've been thinking

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
about ways

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,240
we can help these underrepresented

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,599
groups

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,039
we've both been in technology for nearly

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,560
two decades and we've seen what does

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,080
and doesn't work johnny is now going to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,039
share with you what we think does

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
work and how we can make a lasting

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
change

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,280
in these communities so we can slowly

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
address some of the systemic issues we

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,319
see today

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,319
in america thanks jason and could you

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
stop presenting i need to i'll present

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,560
now

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
thank you sir

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,200
thanks again jason unfortunately

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,839
there is still a sizeable technology gap

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,440
for underrepresented groups

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
let's look at a few ways we can address

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
this

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,440
the first item to address and getting

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,640
more underrepresented people in the tech

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,800
is addressing the hiring pipeline

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,760
traditionally the pipeline has been

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
companies

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
going to colleges and universities and

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,240
raiding their computer science

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
departments for candidates

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,640
however far and wide across the nation

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,080
at least in the united states

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
computer science departments are

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,200
dominated by white men

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
the magazine wired in 2018 did an

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
article

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600
taking a peek into computer science

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
diversity at the college and university

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,959
level

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
this graph i have included in our slides

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,519
kind of underscores this

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
discrepancy we can see the number of

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,839
white males who are computer science

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,880
majors

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,959
easily trumps all other groups listed

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
this under representation at college

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,680
skews that

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
traditional hiring pipeline

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,680
so how do we address this representation

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,519
issue

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
one way is to increase the early

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
involvement of underrepresented groups

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
in tech

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
one way to increase minority

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
participation is through such

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
organizations as

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
black girls code and code.org two of the

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
more preeminent ones

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,279
across the united states at least there

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
are many others but these are probably

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,720
two that i think everyone here has

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
probably heard of

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
these organizations believe in giving

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,440
minorities as early as kindergarten

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
in early intro to tech that normally

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
many of them

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
might not see

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,040
the ceo of code.org hadi pertovi

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
in a 16 minutes interview from several

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,440
years ago had a

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,360
very telling quote and his quote was

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,959
middle school is roughly when girls

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
traditionally drop out of stem fields

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
the idea of code.org and other orgs is

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
by exposing other the underrepresented

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
to entry-level tech skills

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
this sets them up for success in middle

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,720
school high school

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,720
and beyond so as i mentioned earlier

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
traditionally a college degree in a stem

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,720
field has been the gateway

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,160
to a career in tech however as education

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
costs rise

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
this route has become a harder one for

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,480
many to follow

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
also while college has been the main

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,079
pipeline

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
it is not the only one in my career many

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,959
of the most brilliant technologists i've

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
ever worked with

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,320
either never went to college or did go

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,240
to college

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
and didn't study in a stem field

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
so maybe it's time for companies looking

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,160
for talent

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,200
to de-emphasize the traditional

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
collegiate pipeline

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
there are many ways to do this but one

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
way to potentially address this

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
are boot camps we've all heard of boot

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
camps they're a great avenue

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,240
for many to learn a tech skill and to

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,760
build a portfolio for finding a job

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
however just like colleges and

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,839
universities boot camps are not

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,279
cheap and can be cost prohibitive for

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,839
many

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,760
so how about this companies looking to

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,880
increase and diversify their talent

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,800
pipelines

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
can help that effort by offering

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
scholarships

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,839
and other financial assistance to boot

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,160
camps for those looking to pursue this

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,320
route

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
by doing this they can create their own

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
pipeline

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
or augment their current one

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,560
however there is one caveat to this

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,800
if companies are indeed looking to

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
subsidize and fund boot camps

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,320
they must be intentional in recruiting

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
diverse candidates

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
for these boot camps and the subsequent

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,399
hiring

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,079
after participants complete the program

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
don't just pay lip service to the talk

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
on diversity

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,079
let's be intentional in hiring and

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,079
filling these roles

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
even before choosing a route to follow

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,079
in tech students need hardware

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
and as we're discovering during the

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
covet 19

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,240
pandemic internet access to start

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
many companies and local boards of

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,279
education are able to provide

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
partial or fully fund fully subsidized

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,279
equipment

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,560
to students this is great but as i said

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
with cover 19

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,639
we've discovered we discovered that

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,920
internet access is a crucial element for

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,399
that

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
it's assumed nowadays that everyone has

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,040
some type of reliable internet

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,000
connectivity

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,480
but really that's not totally the case

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,399
as i said i'm in the metro atlanta area

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
my wife is a middle school teacher here

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,399
and throughout her remote

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,600
and virtual teachings i've heard

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,680
painstaking

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
stories from her from students who have

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,200
adequate hardware

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,720
but no or substandard internet

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
connection that's a problem

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,199
so companies looking to build and

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
diversify their talent pipelines

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,320
should work with government officials

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
and telecom agencies

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
to band together in the internet

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,040
connectivity

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,440
a basic utility for all

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,120
the new normal undercover 19 has exposed

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,360
this as a must-have

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,920
for students going forward

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,600
and finally while software engineering

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
is certainly a great starting point for

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,079
a career in tech

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,519
by no means is that the only path

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
years ago when i was a computer science

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
major i enjoyed

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
coding i was pretty good at it but at

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,279
the time

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,639
the prospect of sitting at a desk and

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,279
within eight hours a day

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,399
as as a career wasn't really palatable

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
to me

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
it's not until i discovered the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
infrastructure side of things system

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,600
engineering network engineering things

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
like that

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,160
that i was able to marry that coding

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,000
experience with a more hands-on thing

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,199
that really wet my appetite and really

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
got me started in my career

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
there are a wealth of jobs to be had in

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
tech some which certainly leverage a

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,040
coding background

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,360
but many that necessarily do not as you

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
can

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,959
tell from my slide there are many

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,040
diverse fields to choose from

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,360
i'll probably left a few out

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,360
in closing i hope that jason and i have

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
motivated you to think more about

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
how to make your organization and the

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,040
entire tech field in general

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,720
more diverse i'll leave you with one of

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
our favorite quotes from the late john

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
lewis

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,480
when you see something that is not right

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,600
not just

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,040
not fair you had the moral obligation to

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,839
say something

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,839
to do something thank you very much

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
thank you guys so much that was a great

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,240
first talk

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and you deserve some applause there

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,959
isn't enough of that in this format

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
but you nailed it congratulations um we

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
have

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
one question from the audience which i

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,000
sort of took a swag at answering but i

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
would love to have you comment um a

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,920
woman named shambi broom i'm assuming a

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
woman i apologize

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,959
is running a non-profit where they focus

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
on

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,120
computer science training for females

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
how do you respond to people who are

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
offended by the fact

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
that we have females as a focus we don't

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,399
exclude anyone but we have a core

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
mission to bring more women into tech

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,680
guys got any ideas that's always a

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,079
tricky one uh

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
i oh my my radar goes off when people

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,720
when someone complains about

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,639
you know something that's trying to

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,639
increase diversity it's

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
it's almost like you know open your eyes

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,959
there's a reason why we're doing this

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,000
it's not and i think like um champion

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,320
said you're not trying to be

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
exclusive but it is just another

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,360
pipeline to

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
um it's almost like you know their

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
gatekeepers are like hey

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,959
only these people can have the key to

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,079
tech or anything

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,160
it's certainly not that i think um

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,240
groups like that is to know be inclusive

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,399
but maybe have as part of your mission

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
um the goal to increase you know

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,440
participation

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,120
particular group so i don't know if

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
that's helpful or not but i'm

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
certainly seeing that a lot it's it's

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
definitely something to certainly deal

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,199
with

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,480
great thank you now i'm i'm taking more

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
questions if somebody has one that

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,240
they'd like to ask these gentlemen but

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
and we have a few minutes left for

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
questions for this talk

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
um i am going to ask a couple that came

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,400
up for me

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,439
so i'm interested in how you got

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,559
your plan together jason because you

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,760
said that that that

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
you're part of the tech you were sort of

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,199
and then there had to be a plan

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,039
did did uh i'm sorry jason yeah did

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
johnny come in and like help you build a

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,360
plan

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,760
or how did you actually pull it together

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
well so after i delivered the computers

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,440
and

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,679
i brought some of the younger

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
members of our church in and try to

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,480
expose them

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,080
to some some basic coding

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
concepts and it quickly became a big

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,360
challenge

00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,240
because i think my approach wasn't

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
well thought out so when i came across

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
that problem

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,200
i kind of just uh spent some time with

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
my pastor

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,520
and other people that i've worked with

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,960
in the industry to kind of come up

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,600
with a uh your uh entry

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,080
into uh learning more about technology

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,200
and kind of getting down to the basics

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,600
like what's what's a what's a cpu

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
what's a ram what's a motherboard you

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,320
know the basic concepts of a computer

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
and kind of get hands-on uh training

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,679
which uh

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,679
i think got a little bit more engagement

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
because you know just that tactile feel

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,080
of

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,559
touching the hardware and understanding

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
how it works uh was it was a better

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,080
uh launch point and uh it definitely

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,600
drove engagement

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
yeah i think that underscores kind of

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,160
the whole exposure at an early age and

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
you know because i tell my kids this all

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
the time um i

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
tried to show them everything and

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
they're like dad this sucks i want to

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,640
learn this i'm like

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,720
one day you're going to appreciate this

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
which it's kind of dad speak but

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
it's totally true because i look back on

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
my um childhood the biggest thing my mom

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,000
dead gave for me was exposure and

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,679
in 1981 or two that apple ii plus that

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
my dad got for christmas

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,120
basically set me on the path for where

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,360
i'm now so yeah i think

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
just throwing posting giving them those

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,960
nuggets just speaks volumes and you know

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,480
yeah i i agree i i actually got into

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
this field my degrees in french

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,240
literature

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,160
i got into tech by i had a job

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,160
doing records management at a law firm

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,240
and i started doing a talk for

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
librarians essentially who were afraid

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
of computers

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
and were getting jobs in law firms and

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
law firms were all computerizing this is

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
the 80s

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,039
and they didn't know what to make of it

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
and i did the same thing i took machines

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,440
apart

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,200
you know here's a disk drive it's kind

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,120
of like a little record player

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,160
right so we have a couple more questions

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,160
um uh there's one about mesh networks

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
but i'm going to go to the one before it

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,200
first

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
what were your inspirations and paths

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
into technology

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
how do you promote stem in school

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
systems that may not have resources to

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
teach it

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,120
but do this one fast because i've got

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
another one for you too

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
so quickly mine was literally my dad

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,480
buying apple 2e um

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
and also believe it or not was texas

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,600
instruments um computers back in the day

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,120
like the old red kind of led ones i was

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
totally fascinated by how they worked

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
and

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
it really got me into the path of math

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,960
and computer science but that was kind

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
of my early

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,880
entry into it cool how about you jason

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
uh so my dad worked at ibm he worked at

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
big blue

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,000
back in the 80s and uh we

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,120
got an ibm pc junior that had the

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,480
big memory blocks that looked like uh

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,760
literal blocks so we basically

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,960
tore it down rebuilt it and i was just

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,960
a kid into video games so ibm would have

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
these sessions once a month

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
you can go to the office they teach a

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
little bit about programming

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
and uh i i kind of literally just got

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
into programming and learning more about

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,320
dos so i could play video games

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,400
that was cool great and what do you

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,520
think about this problem of stem where

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
there's no resources

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
oh good question that's where i i think

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,760
our

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
educational um systems have to be have

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
to be

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,080
really intentional and focused on this

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,600
you know you may not have

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
resources but you know you have a

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
community of people that can potentially

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
help so

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,360
i think lead on every resource you have

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
um

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
and and you know really call them the

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
outside folks if you're really hurting

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
that

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,120
um bad for it so i know it's a tough

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,240
problem to solve and um

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,640
yeah i know they're willing to help in

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,600
in the richer states they're having to

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,320
hand out

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
um ipads and you know minimum devices

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
just to

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,480
conduct school that during lockdowns

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
right which

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,760
has got to help i mean some of those

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
kids have never had their hands on one

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,200
of those things before

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,600
so this could be a long conversation but

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
i just feel like you took a little bit

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
of our

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,120
defense like budget spending of the

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,320
government and put it towards the

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
schools

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
we could definitely address a lot of the

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
stem issues that we're seeing and

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,840
of course there's some problems with

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
gerrymandering and the way they line up

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
school districts and

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
putting funding towards the more

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,600
affluent areas like we need to

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,360
find a way to make that exposure and

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,200
that opportunity equal

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,280
across all areas of the united states

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,799
yeah totally agree with that um okay how

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,880
about this mesh network question

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
how did the how would mesh networks fit

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
into a strategy

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,520
to give folks better internet access

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,240
good question i know that i know that

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,240
google and amazon are trying to um

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,679
approach against either low high

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,679
altitude balloons or low

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,600
altitude satellites depending on your

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
way of doing this to have some kind of

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,559
more

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,840
kind of a mesh network thing so i think

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,000
that's a great start

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,880
um you know i love to see where that

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,440
goes

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
the engineering kind of was dubious to

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
the reliability and kind of the speeds

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,159
that you need

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
especially nowadays of like streaming

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,760
and things like that so um i think it's

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
a good start

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,520
yeah it's we something institutional has

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,360
to happen and google

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,640
and companies like google seem like they

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,799
have the best incentive

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
to do it maybe also the cable companies

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,120
could go that way but

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,799
exactly um okay i'm gonna have i i jason

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,679
i'm gonna have to actually start

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,679
switching over so i'm hoping that um

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,320
that dr rochelle newton made it back

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
into the fold and if you would turn your

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
camera

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
on and wave at me so i know that you're

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
really here that would be really helpful

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
because otherwise we'll we'll just keep

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,280
doing this for the rest of this time

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,640
um in the meantime go ahead jason you

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,799
were gonna say

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,919
oh i was just gonna say i feel like

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,000
there's some of this

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,760
infrastructure already set up with our

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
with our cell towers

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,440
and you know what if we set up these

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,760
chromebooks and they had

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
like 5g connections already set with

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,039
them and then you subsidize that down to

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
a

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,840
a very affordable cost per month

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,400
like johnny was suggesting maybe make it

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
ten dollars uh yeah lincoln's saying he

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,520
was hoping

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
for for an answer about community owned

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,240
stuff

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,080
um and it's a good idea the the problem

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,320
of course has historically been that all

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
of the wires were owned by

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,400
you know somebody in the communications

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,080
field so google's trying to jumpstart

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,440
over that but you're right it's still a

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,919
corporate effort

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,640
yeah and some of those wires you know i

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,640
feel like they

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,400
are totally subsidized by the government

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
these telecom companies aren't

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
putting those bills completely

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,520
themselves so you know

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,039
it feels like the government could

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,679
potentially have some leverage

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,960
over these telecons they truly wanted to

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,400
make this work

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,039
and i go back to the defense budget that

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
we have

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,320
here in america if we could just reduce

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,760
that by 25

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,360
we could probably address a lot of these

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,520
issues that we're talking about

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,960
yep yeah people are talking in the chat

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,960
now about how

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,799
much better internet is outside of

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,880
america and i can say it's it

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,240
i live in europe and it is much better

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
and cheaper

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,440
so um something has to happen there i

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,520
like the idea of diverting

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,039
defense spending because at some point

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,240
having an informed

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,159
um citizenry is is you know

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,840
part of our national defense i would

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,840
think but

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
