Title: Pressure and Privilege: When You’re the Only One in the Room - Clarence Clayton & Koren Townsend
Publication date: 2020-12-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Diversity and Inclusion Event
Description: 
	Presented by: Clarence Clayton & Koren Townsend, Red Hat
Presented at All Things Open 2020, Inclusion and Diversity Event

Abstract: Think back over your career. Have you ever been the only one in the room that looks like you? How did it make you feel?

These situations can be awkward and intimidating - especially in the workplace. But they also have the potential to build character, create a greater understanding and even drive better business results. And while you might be the only one in the room, you may discover that you’re not alone. Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be a source of strength and support.

Red Hatters Koren Townsend and Clarence Clayton will unpack that awkward and intimidating feeling and talk about their career journeys, challenges and triumphs as leaders in the IT organization and founders of one of Red Hat’s Diversity and Inclusion Communities, B.U.I.L.D. (Blacks United in Leadership and Diversity).

Some of the topics they will address include:
- How your personal background and history influence your perception of the world
- The importance of situational awareness
- Codeswitching. It’s a Thing.
- The pressure to do well and the risk of failure
- Understanding the privilege and responsibility that comes with “making it”
- How a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion can have a major impact on company culture

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,920
um felt

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,279
numerous times throughout my life and in

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
my career and

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,000
that feeling is like so

for black people everywhere but this is

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
the same road together so

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479

look forward to discussing this with you

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
excellent so as we get into this a

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,480
little bit

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
why did we name this session pressure

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
and privilege

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,959
you're going to learn a little bit more

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
about that on the next slide so

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
what you'll see here is that uh there's

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
a picture of

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,519
of serena williams there i am a huge

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
huge huge serena williams fan anyone who

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,280
knows me really well

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
would be able to tell you that i have i

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
always liked tennis but i

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
really started liking it and paying

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
attention to it when serena

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,080
and venus came on the scene in the 90s

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
so i feel like i've been on this

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,599
20-year journey with serena

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
watching her achieve greatness and

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
excellence all along the way

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,400
and it's just been a pleasure to witness

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
her

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
in action she's sitting there or

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
standing there in that picture with

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
billie jean king

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,159
who's another tennis legend in her own

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
right but because i follow serena so

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,400
closely

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,959
i've watched a lot of her interviews and

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
people will ask her sometimes what is it

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
like

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
to be the greatest ever because i do

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,200
think she

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,480
is one of the greatest athletes ever

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
male or female

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
to have ever picked up a racquet or done

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
anything

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
in sport and they'll ask her what is it

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,560
like to

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,599
be that have that level of greatness and

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
and always

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,640
want to you know compete and and be

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
improve and be better and have people

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
that want to beat you

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
when they step out on the court no

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,319
matter what and she will say

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
that billie jean king told her that

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,200
pressure is a privilege

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
and she really wouldn't have it any

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,959
other way so when you think about the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,040
fact that serena

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
you know has achieved all of these

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
wonderful things

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
and every time that she walks out on the

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,360
court

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
people are measuring their game against

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
her she sets the bar

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
she's the gold standard that's a lot to

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
have to deal with

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,960
psychologically on top of just wanting

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
to do well and win yourself

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,360
but she's handled it with grace and

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,120
she's also handled it

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
in a sport that they're not a lot of

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
people that look like her

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,400
and has not always been receptive to her

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
so while i don't have serena's fame or

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
money

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
there are some life lessons that i feel

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,800
like

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,560
i and many others can learn from how

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
she's handled herself

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
under such difficult circumstances

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
throughout her career

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
cory any other thoughts about the title

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,479
or about serena

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
yeah absolutely just the fact when

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
serena and her

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
sister venus came onto the scene you

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759
know years ago

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,039
you know they they brought a literally a

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
different look

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,800
to the tennis uh the field of tennis

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
right and so

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
the fact when i saw them i was like well

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,960
they look like me like they're out here

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
playing tennis

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,120
and like and not just playing but

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
dominating the court right

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
and just the fact that they didn't care

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
what people said people

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,479
criticized their hair their body their

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
skin their clothes like everything was a

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,080
criticism

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
um instead of just focusing on the game

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
that they were

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
really great athletes and it just helped

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
me to perk up a little bit more because

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
i'm like well maybe you know

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
despite all that they're going through

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
people are coming at them

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
all the time and they're still

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
dominating and they're not letting that

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
affect them

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
affect their game i i give them much

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
respect

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
and kudos because that's not easy to do

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,400
um

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
when the whole we feel like the whole

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,880
world is coming against you and they

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
still dominate it and

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
are still great to this day so let's

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
just look at the longevity in that

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
that's right you know she's almost 40

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
had has had a baby

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,680
and it's still coming back and and

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
playing well and doing well so that you

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
know she's just

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,560
an inspiration really yeah

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,160
so if we go to the next slide uh these

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
are some of the the points that we want

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
to make sure we get out

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
in in today's conversation i'm not going

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
to read

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,479
all of them verbatim but i'll just

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
summarize it this way

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
by the time that the session ends i hope

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
that you've let's learn a little bit

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,919
more about

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,080
us how our experiences

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
uh even before coming to red hat even

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,560
before we were born

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,400
have shaped and informed who we are and

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,680
the passion that we feel for the work

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
that we do um

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
at red hat to really advance diversity

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
and inclusion

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,919
in our organization and that i think

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,720
you'll also just be able to

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
find something that resonates with you

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,120
regardless of where

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,199
you are um and regardless of who you are

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
so i'll leave it there because i don't

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,840
want to spoil some of the details as we

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
get into it

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,919
uh corn what other major takeaways do

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,360
understand from the outset yeah yeah

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
it's

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
you know this is just our experience

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,240

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
this is not you know something that

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
we've made up this is things that we

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,240
have gone through

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
not and you'll hear in a little bit just

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
generationally we've gone through

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
our families and our history you know

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
we're not here this is not a pity party

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
we don't need a woe is me

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
type of thing that's not what we're here

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
for but we're here to just

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
share with you our perspectives of the

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
things that we've gone through and that

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
people are continuing to

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,199
having to go through so i look forward

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
to the discussion and i hope you

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,599
things you want to discuss so this is a

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
this is a discussion and we're just you

know here to help kind of facilitate and

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
share our experiences at the same time

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,879
you got it so all right let's go ahead

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
and get into it so

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
pressure and privilege lesson number one

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,960
history is

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
a great teacher so let's go to the next

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
slide so

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,400
this is a picture of my mother and in

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,479
this picture she was in high school and

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,120
my mother was the first

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,000
uh in the first class to integrate her

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,759
high school

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
in northampton county north carolina

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,720
it's uh down in the eastern part of the

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,479
state

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,120
now my grandparents were really active

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,800
in the civil rights movement and

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
fighting for equal rights

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,080
for for black students and not just

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,560
students

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
just across the board but they wanted

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
the same educational opportunities to be

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,320
available to their children

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
that were available to the white

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
students in the county

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,680
so when the time came to integrate

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,440
the high school it was my mother that

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,240
you know was the one of her

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,240
my grandparents children that was up

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,160
next to enter into high school

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,640
and she did not want to go she

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,560
begged and pleaded with them to not send

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
her to just let her go to the black high

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,839
school

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,040
where it was safer where it was just a

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,440
more familiar more welcoming environment

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,560
but they said how could they have been

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,360
fighting

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,760
for these rights and and fighting for

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
this

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
change and then when they had the

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,360
opportunity to actually take advantage

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,240
of it themselves or at least

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
for their children did they not send one

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
of their children that that just would

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
have been cowardly

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,360
and hypocritical so they couldn't do it

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
and it was gut-wrenching for them

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
to to have to tell their teenage child

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
no you have to go

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,720
into an environment that is not

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
going to be welcoming and welcoming it

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
was not

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,399
they did not want them there they would

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,600
get up from the tables

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,360
when you'd sit down to eat lunch my mom

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
told me times that they would brush

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,079
themselves off if they accidentally

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,480
bumped into each other in the hallway

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
she took they didn't have a prom the

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
guidance counselor didn't

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
stress to the black students at the

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
school the importance of continuing

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
their education beyond high school

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
and that just going and getting a job at

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,560
the factory

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,000
was a viable outcome

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,399
not that there's anything wrong with

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,680
that but it wasn't it's not they didn't

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,519
even

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
stress the importance of college as a

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
possibility

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,320
so there were all kinds of structural

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
and systemic

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,399
challenges that that she had to face but

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
she overcame it

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
she graduated from from high school but

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
she would tell you

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
her high school experience was nothing

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
like your typical high school experience

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,240
you don't look back on

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,720
on it with fondness but later on

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,839
she got married she had me and she told

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,480
me about all of this

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
so these are our lessons and stories

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,640
that have been with me

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
um all throughout my life and if you go

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
to the next slide

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,200
what you'll see there is a picture of

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,000
of me last year and in 2019 i was

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
fortunate

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
to be selected as one of red hat's

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
chairman's award winners that's one

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
of red hat's highest honors given to

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
their associates and that's a picture of

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
me with

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,399
our former ceo jim whitehurst and the

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
board of the directors at the time

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
and you know we were flown to boston

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,000
beautiful

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
dinner beautiful scenery as you can see

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,160
in the background

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,440
look like something almost like that i

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,560
shouldn't have been there

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,959
but it was just a very heady rarefied

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
air

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,079
type of moment and when i sat with that

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,200
a little bit

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,720
i thought back to my mom and i said this

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
is not an award that she probably would

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,760
have won in 1965

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,279
this is not what i would have won in

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,880
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,399
but she opened doors she and many others

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,680
like her open

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,200
doors that i could walk through without

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,720
those same barriers

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,720
and they created you know a trail and

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
blaze the trail that just made it easier

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
for the generation that came

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
behind them so i'm very thankful to her

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,200
and so

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,639
many others that were a part of that you

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
know that that journey

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
and made it easier for me now i want to

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,920
also say this

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,240
i was the only black recipient of the

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,639
chairman's award that year

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
i am only the third to have received it

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,279
at this time

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
out of 276 recipients

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
of the war of the reward up to this

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,720
point so

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
we made a lot of progress no question

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
about it but there is still a lot

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,959
to be done so that situations like that

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,760
and and award ceremonies like that look

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,839
more like the world that we live in so i

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
am proud of the work that we've done it

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,440
certainly was a full circle moment

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
and the other point that i want to bring

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
out there is that the pressure that my

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
mother

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
had to experience maybe didn't create

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
privilege for her

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
but it did create privilege and

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,720
opportunities for

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
her son and for people that that came

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
behind her

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,160
so that's my history moment corn over to

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,760
you

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,160
yes we are very similar in many ways so

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
this is a picture of my parents nancy

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,639
and louis atwater from

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,839
uh chapel hill and they were born and

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
raised grew up there

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,800
and you know they both went to the

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
segregated black high school there at

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
the time this is in the mid 60s

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
called lincoln high school and my father

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,160
graduated from that but my mother

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,519
like your mom was in the uh her she

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
spent her senior year as one of the

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,320
first black students to integrate

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
the new chapel hill high school and

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
again

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,920
there are challenges there are you know

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
obstacles right they didn't want them

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,800
there they they loved it

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
being segregated right and and so the

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
fact that they that she didn't quit

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,199
right she didn't you know stop or get a

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,480
job like she kept going

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,480
being the only one at some of her

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
classes being the only one sometimes

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
sitting at the lunch table by yourself

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,839
like walking through the holes and

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,040
and hearing people kind of snickering at

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,120
you that yeah

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,560
that's a that's a not a great way you

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
want to spend your senior year

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,160
but she didn't quit and she kept going

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,040
after it later on

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,880
she went on to be a system admin at

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,760
unc's dental school

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,720
now you're talking about late 80s early

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,480
90s

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
for a black woman in this field which

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
was pretty much unheard of

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,760
right she was the only black person in

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,760
her group only

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
only female in her group and then there

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,600
were times when you know she wouldn't

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
get a promotion she wouldn't get a raise

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,440
and they wouldn't give her a concrete

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,079
answer why but the fact that she's

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
she stuck with it and i wholeheartedly

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,600
believe because her

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
her perseverance and staying in

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,680
technology is a reason why it had such

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,839
an influence on my career

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
she would bring her work home and she

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,440
would take apart the computer

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
and put it back together again and i

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
just thought it was the greatest thing

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,320
ever and i think that's why i kind of

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,120
kind of stuck with me

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
my father on the other hand um not only

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
is he a retired drill sergeant in the

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
army so he had a lot of discipline

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,160
behind his life but being a black man in

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
the army is is not an easy thing

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
especially when you're having to you

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
know command

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,959
white men right and you're talking about

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160
70s

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,920
late late late 60s early 70s

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
that's not an easy feat and he stuck

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
with it he actually retired from

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,560
the army after 30 years um in any at the

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,279
same time he was in the army reserve

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
he also was in the chapel hill fire

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,920
department

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
and he worked his way up through the

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,959
ranks and became the first black captain

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
and first assistant chief in the history

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,680
of the department

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,959
and there were times that he would tell

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
me that they did not want to give him

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,759
that promotion

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,519
but he had to actually fight for it and

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
go and actually you know threatening

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
kind of go to hr

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,320
to say yes i have my qualifications and

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
you still

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,240
are not trying to give me the promotion

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
that i deserve so he would just tell me

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
story just about

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
being the only one you know people not

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,959
listening to him and but the thing is

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
with all of them

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,399
and clancher your family too that they

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,839
didn't quit

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
they kept going because they knew that

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
the struggle that they were going

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880
through

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
was going to be someone's victory

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,279
eventually and that that

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,959
that perseverance continues to pass down

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,000
through the family and so

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,800
it's yeah you may be the only one at the

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
table

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
in the room in the company even but you

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,279
keep going

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,880
there was a time when we all have to

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,720
struggle a little bit but know that you

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,639
know your struggle is not in vain that

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,000
somebody it will pay off eventually

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,000
which leads us to our next

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
lesson which is black majority versus

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
black minority so

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
this next picture i'm going to show you

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
is very interesting that as clarence and

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,399
i were doing a research for this

00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,360
for this talk is that we were kind of

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,360
comparing upbringings in a way and

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,319
so on the left side is what my high

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
school looked like this was my junior

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,919
cheerleading high school picture there's

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,919
two of us in the picture

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
actually the mascot was a black female

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,679
to two so technically three right

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,039
and then on the right side is clarence's

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,079
high school and it's

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,079
very different i grew up very much

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
always neighborhood most i grew up in

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,199
chapel hill cardboard area

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,679
mostly white town um elementary middle

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
high school looked just like this i was

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
always usually the only one

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,919
and it to me it was just normal that's

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
how it was and that's how i adjusted it

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
wasn't like

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
you know i wasn't upset about it it

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,960
would have been nice to have more

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,039
but more of a diverse you know school

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
upbringing but at the same time

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,799
this was the hand that i was dealt and

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
the fact that i even went on to nc state

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
university which again is a

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
predominantly white university

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
it wasn't a whole lot of us there but it

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
was enough of us to kind of create a

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
community and a family

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,039
in a sense that you know we still

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
together and that

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,000
you know we we formed this kind of bond

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,240
because we were the only ones

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
um i think i know clients you talk about

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,600
just how

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
everything you had around you was very

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,679
much african-american

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
and then you know corporate america

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,280
sometimes

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,360
you know doesn't really mimic that as

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,080
well i mean what is your experiences

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
as you were growing up clarence yep and

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
as

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,440
you can see from the picture i mean

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
that's you know when i was in high

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
school i don't know if it was my

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,919
sophomore

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
junior year one of the two but exact

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,640
polar opposite of your experience cory

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,320
my neighborhood as much as you can have

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
a neighborhood in the country

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,679
uh was all black elementary middle

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,039
school

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,679
high school predominantly 90 black

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
and another quick point i want to make

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
if you

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,760
tying this back to my mother the high

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,919
school that

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
that she went to is basically the same

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,520
high school that i went to

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,960
and there are 24 years in between when

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,000
she graduated

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,640
and when i went to high school

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,480
and in that 24 years it had gone from

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
what she experienced

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
to something totally different now we

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
don't have time to really unpack all of

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
that today

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,559
but and there is a such thing as white

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,440
flight

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
they decided you know what don't like

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,280
that

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,520
gonna give the this school to you and

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,320
they move to the neighboring county

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
or to other parts of the county and just

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,160
allow that to become

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,400
a primarily black school so it's just

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,640
amazing how in the circle of

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
in that same building and that same

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,280
structure

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,520
how it had morphed from mostly white

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,360
to almost exclusively black in the

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
course of that time

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,919
i also went to at hbcu a historically

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,559
black college i went to north carolina a

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,520
t so there any aggies on the call aggie

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,120
pride

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,960
and so the first 21 years of my life

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,000
primarily were you know around

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,799
exclusively black people now i did uh

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
bold

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,400
and that was my one of my

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,480
extracurricular activities and that was

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
mostly white a few black people not too

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,440
many so

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,280
and that was different for me and i

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,240
remember even as a kid

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,520
saying okay that's different i'm not

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,880
used to this

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,000
but it was certainly a

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,919
a forbearer or foreshadowing of what you

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
know the world was going to be what my

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,799
world was going to be

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
but that was just for two or three hours

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,280
on a saturday and then i went back into

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,240
my

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
black bubble but by the time i started

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
my career

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
and it was not unlike many corporate

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,400
american environments

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,039
i was you know one of few on my team

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
and i don't remember being shell-shocked

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,600
by it though

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,280
i don't remember saying i i can't

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,799
function i can't focus i don't know what

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,080
to say i don't know what to do

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,320
so i wasn't paralyzed with the fear i

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
my mom had told me what i was gonna be

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
you know what i need to be prepared for

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,840
and what i was going to be up against so

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
i

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,600
felt ready in that regard and i've just

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
always been

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
adaptable in that way to just be able to

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,320
just jump in

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,919
and and figure it out but

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,480
at the end of the day the the challenge

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,320
you know with that that i feel some

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
people deal with in that

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
i sort of feel like i didn't because

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,840
because i had so much time

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
in the majority i almost feel like i

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,000
know

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,039
what it's like for

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,559
the white majority because i i lived it

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,679
so i understand what it's like

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,200
that you know that maybe blind spots or

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
perspectives you don't have

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
because you're more in the majority

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,679
group so that doesn't make it okay

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,600
but it does give me a different ability

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
i think to understand

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,960
and try to meet people where they are

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,799
and figure out if there's a way

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
that you know we can walk forward

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,559
together

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,159
and have a different understanding so

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,320
that's um you know that's sort of my

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,080
background and how it brought me

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
uh up to you know where i started my

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,360
career right

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,120
so i think we're moving into the next

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,720
lesson which you know talks about the

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
psychological challenges so

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,840
corn and i sort of set the stage of you

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,440
know how we got into corporate america

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,880
and now that we're here how do you deal

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
with that

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
so if you go to the next uh slide here

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,200
you'll see

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
a picture of this gentleman and if you

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
can

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,440
look for the most part it looks like

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,559
he's

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,799
almost the only one in that picture

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,840
it might be a young lady over there in

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,600
the corner

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,280
that that that's black but for the most

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,960
part he he's the only one

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
don't know what he's thinking don't know

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
how he feels about it

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,320
but the visual is is clear that he is

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,280
one of

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,480
um very few that look like him in in

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,559
that environment

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,840
and that's been my experience many times

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,960
when i before i came to red hat and and

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,799
even

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,799
since i've been there i've been you know

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,039
the only one on my team

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:18,240
and there are conversations that happen

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,960
that i know nothing about there are

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,799
tv shows that people watch that i know

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,799
nothing about

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,360
there are experiences and trips and

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,440
movies and you name it there's a lot of

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,679
of conversation that's happened

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,760
that i just don't have perspective for

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,200
and i don't know that i can make a

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
meaningful

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
authentic contribution and there are

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,159
times where i've said so should i go and

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
google that

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,480
and try to act like i know what they're

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,039
talking about although i really don't

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,320
or do i say nothing and then you're like

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
well you're not really

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,159
fitting in and jailing with the team or

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,799
do i

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
offer something that they may not have

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,039
any you know perspective for

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,559
and then that's still you know awkward

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,240
so these are all

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
challenges all things that are sort of

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,760
swirled in my mind and this is just

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,200
trying to have a conversation

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
i'm not even really trying to do any

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
work i just try to figure out how to you

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
know bond with

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,320
the team but something else i wanted to

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,120
share really quickly

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,200
is i have been really fortunate in my

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
career especially at red hat to work on

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,360
some really

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,360
high profile projects where

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
jim whitehurst the former ceo and the

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,640
current ceo paul cormier have been in

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
the room

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,480
i've been in the red hat board room

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
there is i don't see anyone that looks

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,520
like me

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,080
i look on the video conference

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
i don't see anyone that looks like me

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,360
and i say okay

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
i want to do the best job i absolutely

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,400
can

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,640
because it's important to me to show up

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
well for myself and my own personal

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
brand

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
but here's the other thing that i i want

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,559
people to know and i'm not saying all

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,039
black people are like this i'm just

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,480
speaking for me

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,600
i feel an extra burden and pressure

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
to perform and do well because if i

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,520
don't

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,039
i am afraid that i am cutting off a

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,159
potential opportunity

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,120
for another black person i feel

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,400
that the other black coat my other black

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,720
co-workers at red hat

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
and people who are not even in the door

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
yet

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,200
are counting on me to do well so that

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
they may

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
get an opportunity doesn't mean that

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
they will certainly get one but they

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,480
might get one

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,960
but if i bomb if i fall on my face and i

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,159
just

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,480
am unable to deliver i have this

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,320
this fear of well that didn't work out

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,159
too well we're probably not gonna you

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,440
know go in that direction again

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,200
and here's the thing i had this

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
conversation with one of my

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,360
white colleagues a white man and he said

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,679
that thought has never crossed my mind

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,799
i said and that thought crosses my mind

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
every

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,159
single time i'm in a high pressure

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,159
situation like that

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
that i'm representing something far

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,320
greater than me

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,960
so i want you to just think about that

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,440
reality that's the psychology of i'm in

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,440
here

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,039
not only do i want to do well i got all

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,880
these other processes running in my head

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,159
that i have to confront and move beyond

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,159
and push through

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,760
in order to try to be successful so

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,000
that's the psychology

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
of being the only one in the room corn

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
what about you

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
absolutely the whole like you know going

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
back to what you were saying about

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,760
trying you know

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,120
fitting in just but the cultural

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,480
differences you know

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,240
and you're not talking about just work

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
that's all about music pop culture

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,400
clothing even your hair like it's

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,080
it sometimes can be a conversation but

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,440
it can be like you know i don't know

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,880
what you are talking about i haven't

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,200
seen that before

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,679
absolutely that that kind of that pull

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,919
to kind of fit in to be a team player

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,039
but at the same time still you know

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,840
holding on to your

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,880
auth intensity that's that's that's huge

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,919
um

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
and there is this pressure to you know i

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
don't want to screw this up

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
because if i screw it up then you know i

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
don't know if somebody else will get a

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,679
chance

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,400
and that goes through my mind a lot

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,159
especially

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
every you know every new company that

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,760
i'm i'm with there is this

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
kind of underlying thought that yeah you

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
know

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,240
how many white people are here you know

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
how how can i help other black people

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
get here that means i have to be

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,600
almost nearly perfect in everything that

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,279
i do

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
because somebody else you know they may

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,159
see that and and not

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
want to give a chance to someone else

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,799
and so absolutely it is

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
it is definitely you know in our

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,880
thoughts

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,399
a lot um in every situation especially

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,000
like you were saying in high profile

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,480
situations you know

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,679
um one thing i found like it helps to

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
kind of

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,360
you know deal with that is like finding

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
community amongst

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,279
the people there once the other black

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,799
people there other females even

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,320
just having that sense and that

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,440
camaraderie with other people who may be

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
going through what you're going through

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,240
and that kind of

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,840
leads us into our next point

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,720
of you know finding community

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,600
right so lesson four you can stand alone

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,039
or you can

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,360
build a community and bill we'll talk

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,000
about what what bill really means

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
but it's it's about finding people who

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
have like interests and

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,279
who want to make a difference for

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,919
wherever you are

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,919
so clarence and i are a part of an

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,799
organization it's an erg and employee

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,960
resource group

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
called build stands for blacks united in

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,520
leadership and diversity

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,679
it is a diversity and inclusion group at

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,240
red hat we were established

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
and the thought started in 2015 john

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,360
chapman thought of it he is also an

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,000
nc state alum um how can we just get

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,039
black people

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,039
together we really were meeting kind of

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,559
secretly and on the side that we didn't

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,440
really weren't sure

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,399
how red hat and the manager management

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
staff would really

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,360
be open to us meeting and so it was

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,880
really like secretive meetings at lunch

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,360
and it really just started out about

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,200
let's just network you know we happened

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,000
all most a lot of us were on the 15th

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,679
floor

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,360
of the headquarters of red hat and we

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
just started saying hey let's just get

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,000
together

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,679
let's just talk let's just socialize a

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,200
little bit get to know each other

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,440
and from that in 2017 it grew into

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,320
being an official dni community of red

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,520
hat

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,000
and we started thinking well how can we

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,080
not only

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,039
just helping you know the associates of

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
red hat

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
but what else can we do maybe outside of

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,960
red hat to get more

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
you know applicants from hbcus coming

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,600
into red hat

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,679
and thinking there's got to be a way

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,919
that we could do more and so

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,240
it was a it was a not only a networking

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
opportunity for the black associates

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,000
but it was also retention like people

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,120
were staying

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,200
at red hat because of their connections

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
that they made within the dni group

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,039
you know we were kind of our built-in

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,960
support system in many ways

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,559
and not just within our inside of red

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,679
hat but also outside we do a lot of

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
community outreach

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
we partner with the daniel center for

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,279
science and math that is in

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,559
downtown raleigh just you know making

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,279
sure that children

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,960
of that even that age k through 12 know

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
what red hat is everybody

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
you know there's a lot of brands out

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,559
there but do people really know what red

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,559
hat

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,679
really does and we wanted to make sure

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,159
that that pipeline

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,279
into red hat and just knowing who we are

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,039
was familiar

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,440
to even children of that age and we've

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
done several things with campus outreach

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,240
we just had a

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,399
earlier this month we had an outreach

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
opportunity an all-day event where we

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,320
taught

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
hbcu students like what is open source

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
what does red hat do

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
how can you get a job what about

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,880
internships i mean this was

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,720
things that we just thought that it

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,200
would be a great way to help

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,880
increase that pipeline into red hat and

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,880
the fact that now red hat has

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,679
really invested truly in dni

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,519
i think speaks volumes of the you know

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,080
they see it helping the bottom line they

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,320
see

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,159
it connects their associates it connects

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,600
people to the company and

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,600
we're helping people to really want to

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,279
do better i know clarence you and i were

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
both on the kind of the founding member

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,080
one of

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,360
two of the family members of build and

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
just how you know

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
what is your perspective on how we've

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
grown over the last

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,760
five years officially you know it's it's

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
so interesting i remember

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,880
when we first when i first came to red

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,240
hat

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,159
we i noticed this like the black people

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
didn't really do a whole lot of like

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,799
socializing didn't really you know talk

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
to each other

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,960
and i i've said this before corn and i

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
have known each other

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,799
the entire time we've been at red hat

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,399
we've never worked on a project together

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,080
i would see her in the hallway we'd

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,840
smile we'd say hello

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
but that was that was sort of it we've

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,000
just never been on a project together

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,080
but we've done something really really

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,720
important and meaningful

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,360
that has just made outstanding

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,679
contributions to red hat's culture

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,440
every time i think of my proud

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,360
accomplishments in my career

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
the work that you know we've done with

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,600
bill is

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
at the top of the list that i say all

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,200
the time

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,600
you mentioned retention it is retention

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,080
red hat has been a great company for me

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,240
and to me

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,080
but i really wouldn't want to leave

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
build i would not want to leave

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,200
the people the community the connection

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,320
the camaraderie the fellowship the

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,480
friendship

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,240
you know the the bonds that we formed

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,399
with each other over the last

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,720
five years have been you know nothing

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,360
short of of amazing we support each

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
other

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,000
inside and outside of work and you know

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,200
family our families have gotten to know

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,919
each other so

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,000
it is and it's absolutely a built-in

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,960
retention

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,840
component if companies take the time to

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,080
invest in it

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,039
absolutely one other thing i wanted to

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,279
say really quick

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,679
is build has really allowed me

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,240
to i would what i would call lean into

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,880
my blackness at work

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,080
and that could be taboo because there's

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,640
some people who say

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,200
i just want to be seen for doing a great

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,960
job

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,440
and there's nothing wrong with wanting

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,120
to be seen for doing a great job

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
the fact of the matter with the world

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,679
that we're living in

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,480
i cannot take this off and

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,120
the good news is that red hat doesn't

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,679
want or

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,720
expect me to and i have not felt at any

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
point

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,279
that being a lead in this organization

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,679
in this community

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,399
has been to the detriment of my career

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,440
so i appreciate and applaud

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,399
that the company wants to have these

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,440
conversations

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,960
and gives us a forum to actually be able

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,240
to do it so i am just looking forward to

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,360
continuing to build on the the success

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,279
that we've had

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,200
and and seeing what we can you know do

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,840
next we set a really high bar for

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,080
ourselves

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,679
each and every year and i'm just proud

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
to know that you know we you know

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,120
continue

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,720
to exceed that bar and i know that

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,000
that's going to continue

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,200
yeah so just one shot before you finish

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,440
um clarence is the chair of the current

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,240
chair of build right now and is doing

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,960
a awesome job leading this community and

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,359
has

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,560
has always continues to raise the bar i

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,440
just want to put that down

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,399
because thank you clarence you were a

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,560
natural leader so know that

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,520
it's but it's a group of people working

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,240
together and

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,960
and we we are the engine that powers the

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
success

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,040
and corn is affectionately known as the

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,800
first lady of bill

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,679
and she wears the title very very well

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,399
so i think we're getting to our last uh

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,560
lesson

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,480
which is really about finding and using

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,560
your voice and answering the call

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,240
so look we just keep it all the way real

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,159
2020 has been a year and it's still

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,720
october we haven't gotten to december

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,040
yet

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,880
2020 has really been a challenging year

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,560
we had our plans

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,079
of what we thought we were going to do

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400
with bill this year

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,920
and then the pandemic happened so we had

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,599
to change all of that

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,040
anyway and then may happened

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,720
where you know we had the murder of

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,720
george floyd

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,720
and before that you had other things

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,280
going on with ahmad ah berry

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,119
brianna taylor none of this is new none

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,599
of this is new by the way

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,359
but it was thrust into the spotlight

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,320
this year in such a

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,160
bright and harsh way that we really had

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,640
no choice but to confront it

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,480
and say you know what are we going to do

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,760
who do we want to be

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,839
what side of this moment and movement

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,839
do you really want to be on and

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:47,359
the protests and things happen in

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,800
downtown raleigh

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,920
i think the weekend of may 31st and

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,560
after that corn and i were contacted and

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
said that

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,560
there are things that we feel like we

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,000
need to do as an organization as our as

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,119
red hat

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,599
and we do need some assistance

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,960
figuring out how to hit the right marks

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,079
and

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,119
i am glad that build existed because

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,119
build exists because of the the

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,520
relationships and the the

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,359
reputation that that our community and

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,160
corn and i have been able to

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,640
help cultivate we were uniquely

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,040
positioned to be at the table

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,320
to participate in that conversation now

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,599
i say this all the time

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,960
i am not a dni expert i just have 40

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,839
years of experience as a

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,240
a black man uh and 20 in corporate

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,839
america as a black man so i can tell you

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,480
from that perspective what i think you

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,640
need to do

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,960
but we did not go to school for this but

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,280
we were uniquely qualified i think

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,480
to meet the moment and be able to give

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
some thought leadership to the

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,520
organization

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,680
so really quickly here i don't want to

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,839
cover the picture there

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,040
um is with me and my daughters red hat

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,680
painted a mural

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,599
in downtown raleigh just to let the

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,079
community let the city know

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,720
that we stand in solidarity in the fight

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,160
against racial and social injustice

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,280
uh paul cormier our ceo put a a note out

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,320
on our website

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
letting it be known exactly where red

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
hat stands

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,359
and we've also established some really

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,440
strong partnerships with a couple

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,520
of or organizations the southern

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,240
coalition of social justice is very

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,760
involved

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,359
in the fight for for social justice in

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
uh in north carolina and in the

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,640
southeastern part of the country

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,640
and we're also getting really

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,640
more established with shaw university

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,960
which is right in red hat's backyard

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,480
literally you can walk to shaw from red

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,280
hat's headquarters

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,079
these are just a few things there's a

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,040
lot more

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,079
that needs to be done but these are all

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,920
positive steps

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,480
that we are taking and have been taken

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,320
based on guidance and recommendations

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,079
from the build community

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,520
so it's nice to be at the the table

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,920
and when you talk about pressure and

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,079
privilege again

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
the the pressure of these challenges

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,720
that we've dealt with

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,400
is is a lot the pressure of having taken

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,000
on this additional burden above and

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,880
beyond our day job is a lot

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,280
but there is privilege in being able to

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,520
say

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
that you built a community that's

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,920
thriving and doing so well

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,079
and is able to also contribute to the

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,200
conversation about bringing about

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,720
meaningful and long-lasting change corn

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
what would you say about our last few

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,240
months

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,800
absolutely i remember that day was

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,240
sunday may 31st around 2 p.m we got the

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,800
call it says hey we need

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,079
build input on helping with the

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
direction

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,760
of you know dni efforts to help our

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,720
associates

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,680
um the fact that we had already kind of

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
been doing

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,040
we're you know organized work for about

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,800
three years up until that point

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,359
you know it the timing couldn't have

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,240
been better i think we were prepared and

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,400
ready

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,920
for that call and that the leadership

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
team that we had

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,560
was awesome and that we jumped on it and

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,119
just kind of ran with it the fact that

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,920
red hat has been so supportive of having

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,079
us

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,920
at the table has been a blessing because

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
it could it could have gone a different

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,200
way right i mean the fact that

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,760
you know over the last three years one

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,720
thing that we as bill has done

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,520
is host martin luther king jr day of

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,079
service

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,040
which is something that we started back

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,320
in

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,000
or three years 2018 that it was just a

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,960
lunch and learn we just came we ate

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,760
lunch we

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,640
we you know watched some videos of mlk

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,200
and then

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,000
up until last year where it's a full day

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,599
we work we

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,119
everybody in the company has an

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,880
opportunity to

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,359
serve you don't have to take a vacation

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,720
day but you do you do have to volunteer

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,720
in some way

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,000
and that that kind of started out of

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,000
build and just

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,359
red hat seeing that need and seeing that

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,960
people want to give back

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,960
i mean just to think of the things that

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,520
we've done over the last three years has

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,760
been

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,119
pretty amazing and i look forward to

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
continuing the work

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,640
and there is much work to be done we're

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,560
not done we haven't

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,000
crossed the finish line yet there is

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
lots of work to be done and i look

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,520
forward to continue partnership

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,119
especially with the southern coalition

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,760
for social justice because they not only

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,319
do

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,119
social they do um social justice issues

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,240
but they do

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,480
you know police advocacy and

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,440
uh voter education rights i mean these

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,319
are things that

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,200
affect us all outside of the building of

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,720
red hat so

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,160
i look forward to continuing to do the

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,839
work and we you know we've done some

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,839
really amazing things over the years

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,839
indeed all right so we're we're wrapping

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
up here so we're gonna i'm gonna hit

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,880
this you know really quickly

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,640
just some things to remember and take

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,040
away from today's

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,640
discussion your struggle may be someone

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,880
else's victory

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,880
it may not happen in your time but you

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
may be blazing a trail for someone else

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,599
just like my mom

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,440
and hopefully like me i'm hoping that my

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,680
children corn's children

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
and the generations behind us don't have

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,240
to deal with some of the things that

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,720
we've had

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,680
have had to deal with and and everyone

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,000
can do something

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,920
a lot of times i hear people say well

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,920
you know i don't know what to do

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,480
you can read a book you can watch a

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,520
podcast you can go paint a mural

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,480
you can donate money you can do it there

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,359
is something for

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,160
everybody to do to either contribute to

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,880
that movement

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,560
or just learn have a conversation with

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,800
your colleague and say

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,119
hell i like to understand like you know

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,599
can we just go for coffee go for tea

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,560
jump on a a google meet and just have a

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,200
chat

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,520
which goes into building those genuine

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,520
connections with your co-workers

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,599
i can't imagine my life a red hat

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,400
without the friends and co-workers and

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
the tribe

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,839
that that is around me and help support

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,359
me and

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,040
lift me up that sustains me

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,800
and it helps to know that you're not

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,560
alone and that you have people who

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,079
actually care about you and want to see

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,280
you do well

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,000
corn what is some of your final

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,280
takeaways yeah the fact we have this

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,200
support circle

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,119
um is is vital i think that is what has

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,920
kept a lot of us connected

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,319
to the the company and just to each

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,839
other

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,920
like that we know that we're all in this

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,000
struggle together you know

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,920
i i say if you ever want to know more

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,760
about a different culture or a different

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,400
experience just have a conversation

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
it's nothing formal just talk to your

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
co-workers

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,800
you know it's it's not doesn't have to

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,720
be a big thing

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,839
you know the work is there the work

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,880
needs to be done

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,240
and are you in this or aren't you like

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,359
if you're not a part of the solution

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,160
then you're going to be a part of the

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,560
problem

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,240
right so continue to just connect with

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,960
your co-workers and make this

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,880
you know this is a movement you know

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,520
it's it's not a moment it's a movement

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,400
it's kind of

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,319
it's a continuous cycle of work that we

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,280
will all be a part of

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,800
um and it's a friend of ours said this

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,480
quote to us you know

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,240
you are built for this moment and i say

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,640
no we are built for this moment

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,440
this movement this will continue to go

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,520
on and

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,520
like our parents the sacrifices they

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,240
made we won't ever have to make to that

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,839
degree

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,440
but we would do there is a struggle to

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,599
be had and we're willing to do the work

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,599
so

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,160
okay we'll do this really quick and then

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,040
maybe try to take two questions

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,720
so i encourage everybody to go and look

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,640
and you can look at the qr code

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,280
august 28th the day in the life of a

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,200
people was directed by ava duvernay

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,960
and it was amazing it just talks about

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,960
some really historical moments

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,960
in black history that all happened on

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,440
august 28th but this poem

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,040
was a part of that that documentary and

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,720
uh corn and i want to at least read a

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,880
couple of lines from it here

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,880
it was written in 1928 and although it's

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,160
been 92 years i think it's still

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,359
relevant today

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,400
so here we go i am not tragically

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,880
colored

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,599
there is no great sorrow damned up in my

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,680
soul or

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,319
lurking in my eyes i do not mind at all

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,520
i do not belong to the sobbing school of

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,680
negro hood

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,000
who maintained that nature has somehow

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,839
given them a low down dirty deal

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,680
and whose feelings are all heard about

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,520
it

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,040
even in the hell to skelter skirmish

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,359
that is my life i have

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,680
seen that the world is for the strong

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,280
regardless of a little pigmentation

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,760
more or less no i do not weep at the

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,680
world

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,560
i am too busy sharpen my oyster knife

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,160
and this if you've never seen the video

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,560
i suggest take your phone out

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,599
and scan that qr code it's a really

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,599
really impactful

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,920
video of just august 28th and what it

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,119
kind of means to american history

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,720
um and and to that thank you for hearing

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,240
us thank you for listening thank you for

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,720
joining this session

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,680
we look forward to having a conversation

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
we're going to take a couple of

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,040
questions

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,760
and you know be a part of the movement

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,920

thank you for listening i appreciate it

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,480
thank you all for

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,880
coming any questions so it looks like we

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,160
have

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,000
ricky i don't know if you were going to

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,960
read though it looks like we have a few

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,960
maybe we can go to like say 3 48 and

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,319
um i'm gonna read the first i'll write

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,079
that first go ahead

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,000
i'll do the first one how do you address

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,319
what must be constant asks from

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,920
well-meaning non-bipac

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,000
black indigenous people of color

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,480
individuals to do their own work and

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,440
advocate for racial parity and equity

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,560
and be better allies uh i'll take this

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,640
one really quick because

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,240
there's a very real question and i'll

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,000
also be the first one to say i don't

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,040
always have all the answers i can tell

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,520
you what i think

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,280
i could give you you know my perspective

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,440
um or maybe some other like you know

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,880
podcasts and things that i listen to

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,119
but i will tell you something that we

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,400
did do um and build

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,440
is we actually started up an ally ship

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,839
work stream so there is a group

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,960
uh that is dedicated to supporting the

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,280
work and ongoing education of allies

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,200
um it's meant to be a safe space for

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,560
those non-bipoc

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,800
individuals to really be able to

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,119
confront some of their biases and some

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,760
of the the challenges or maybe mis

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,680
understandings or misperceptions uh that

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,520
they maybe have been taught or

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,079
thought about all their life and it's

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,720
it's led by a white woman is actually

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,040
the lead

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,880
of the allyship work stream in

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,400
consultation with some

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,079
some black uh members of build who also

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,800
provide some thought leadership in that

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,480
space so

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,560
that seems to have worked well we've

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,640
been able to sort of move that work

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,640
um into its own dedicated area

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,079
and maybe one more just one more the

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,000
next one

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,000
says have you had opportunity to work

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,520
for minority owned companies so far and

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,359
if so how different

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,599
has it impacted your pressure privileged

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,680
psyche regardless of your team's racial

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,800
composition

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,119
um i have not um

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,560
i i even had an experience where i was

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,000
the only one in the whole company it was

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,560
a small startup company

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,760
and i was the only black female and only

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,359
black person and

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,800
and the fact that you know i kind of

00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,520
felt there was this kind of

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,720
air of you know i checked both boxes i'm

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,079
black and female

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,640
diversity done we don't need to worry

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,720
about it anymore you know it's

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,559
you adjust right i because i've kind of

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,599
had that my entire life

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,000
i adjusted to what was given you know i

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,400
don't

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,119
get upset don't get mad just i work with

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,359
what i have

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,319
and keep it moving right i can't i don't

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,559
think you can sit there and be

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,760
angry because that doesn't not going to

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,280
get you anywhere but

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,640
i mean clarence have you had ever had an

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,400
opportunity to work for a minority owned

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,680
company or

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,000

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,400
of conversations about corporate america

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,760
and she would also say

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
that's just not something they didn't

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,760
have to deal with the same challenges

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,280
that's not to say that they didn't have

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,760
issues but they

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,800
weren't some of the things that i think

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,800
that we experienced

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
