Abstract: As Covid-19 has ravaged the economy and killed hundreds of thousands of people, one should ponder the impact of the pandemic had more organizations implemented artificial intelligence and automation. Major corporations like fast food chains, retailers, and groups would have pivoted to prevent job loss, food insecurity, and displacement.

As current and emerging technologies are poised to disrupt how we live, play, and work, some of the most vulnerable communities will find access, inclusion, and understanding of these technologies challenging. The future of work is distorted now because of the pandemic. However, we the world is safe again, the haves and the have nots will move further apart. So, what can be done to prepare for these changes? Census data collected this year will provide some insights to parse fact from fiction. Unemployment numbers after Covid will also provide useful data to highlight who, what, and where of populations on fringes.

As information technologists, it is incumbent upon us to develop, and simplify what goes into the public domain with an eye on those with lesser education, experience, and knowledge as these technologies see the light of day. This presentation is meant to describe the possible difficulties for marginalized communities and identify the areas where bias and discrimination may take root and further devastate communities of color, economic disparities, and the digital divide.

my name is dr rochelle

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,759
newton i am a technologist

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,440
for duke university health systems uh

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,600
this is about my third or fourth

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,520
all things open talk in a while um

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
i have some slides going to share with

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,720
you but i want to start off by talking

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,599
about diversity and what diversity means

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
it's a buzzword that we use all the time

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
you hear it everywhere

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,000
you know diversity diversity and

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,520
inclusion diversity inclusion and

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,120
belonging in the most practical sense

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,039
diversity means just different

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,399
but in the space where we are in

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,600
technology

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
in stem science technology medicine and

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,960
math

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,320
diversity is diversity of thought

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,600
action ideas and persons

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,760
coming together for the common good

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,519
whatever that organization's mission is

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,840
whatever it is that they're intending to

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,159
do

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,240
a small group of people intend to do is

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,119
having diverse of everything not just

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,760
the persons

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
but it's the verse of everything so i am

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
going to share my screen with you

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
and i want to share my slide

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
presentation i made for you i'm so proud

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
of myself

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,640
uh for doing this it's not my strength

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,560
of doing these kinds of things but

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,200
i thought i would try

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
so um can you see my screen can you all

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
just

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
make some kind of noise or

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
acknowledgement if you can see myself

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,159
yes we can see it thank you

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
excellent so um if you look at my second

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
slide here can anybody tell me why you

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
think i picked this slide

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
well okay i won't make you wait too long

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
yeah i don't think

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
i think i'm the only one that's allowed

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
to actually talk to you i'm going to say

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,840
that it's because the trees are all

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
different

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,880
exactly the idea behind this

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,080
this slide is nature is our most

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,280
perfect example of diversity

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
there is not one tree so if there's not

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
a

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,400
magnolia tree or a pine tree or oak tree

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
or a birch tree

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,040
there are gazillion trees last time i

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,000
checked there are over 1500 different

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,400
tree types that have been identified and

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
what's

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
important about that is that we can have

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,800
diversity

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,879
by recognizing the value of each one of

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
those trees so why is it necessary just

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,800
to have a magnolia tree

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,160
or a birch tree or a cedar tree it is

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,680
because the diversity of these trees

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,319
produce something for the environment

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,319
that makes the environment better

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,400
so when we talk about diversity of

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,400
persons it's very important that we

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,680
think about what that really means

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,640
so in pure sense in 2015 google released

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,239
this facial recognition software

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
and if you're familiar with this it was

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
a complete bomb

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
because every time it saw a person with

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,000
a darker skin tone it put up a picture

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,800
of a gorilla

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
google is a smart company they have good

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
intentions

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
so you can imagine that they did not

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
intend for this to go that way

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,920
but what they did do is they had all

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,080
people who look

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,560
and think a lot alike so

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,599
i think that in a lot of ways we need to

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,560
take lessons for what's around us

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,519
so diversity of persons diversity of

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
thought

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
diversity of actions and so when you

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
think about this in in a more generic

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
way

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,239
and i imagine a lot of you are much

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
younger than i am

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,920
back in my day when i first came into

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
i.t there was this thing called group

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
zinc

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
it's now uh developed a negative

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
connotation but group think

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
back in the day used to mean that a

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
group of people got together saying

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
thought about something and came to a

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
conclusion sort of like what you would

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,280
see in a jury trial right you're

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
presented some information

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,319
you as a group of people sit around and

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,760
talk and think about it and you come up

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,159
with a conclusion or

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
a result that is what you think is

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
reasonable to what the question was that

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,840
was asked

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
groupthink moved and lost its its

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,760
position

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
over time but group i think was funded

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
by or had a foundation of the old boys

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,600
network

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,840
right so stem i started in stem

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,240
1977. 98

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
98 of the people that i worked with were

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
white

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
men and if you think about that in just

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
pure

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
population terms what did they have in

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
common

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,120
they're white they were male

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
they probably had some moral or value

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
systems that were similar

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
and because of that a lot of what they

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,560
did remarkable work

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
not to understate that at all making

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,919
some remarkable things

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
but they forgot about the need for

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
diversity and when you don't have

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,280
diversity included in your work

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
then you're missing part of the point

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,960
most companies want to be productive

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,080
colleges want to graduate their students

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,800
businesses want to make money we need

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
diversity

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
it cannot be anything else other than

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,759
diversity

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,479
so when we think about these these

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,039
old ideas you know group think

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,160
homosocial reproduction he peaked

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,360
the old boys club and we're still

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,240
faced today 2020

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,039
going into 2021 with a predominantly

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
white male

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,080
culture in information technology and

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,639
with emerging technologies coming

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
up faster than ever we've heard a lot of

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,320
talk about bias

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,080
introduced into these technologies and

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
i'll give you the best one that i know

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
of

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,759
so most of us we apply for a job

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,759
in in modern times it goes into

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,440
something called an ats an application

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,199
tracking system

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
and it has certain ground rules or

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,880
algorithms it's looking for right

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
so if the job is for a mac guru an apple

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,000
google

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,160
that must be in the cv or resume that

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,319
the person has submitted

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,360
if it's said that you it wanted you to

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
work at a large

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
organization that does similar things to

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,199
that that the current

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
organization does that's another one of

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,759
those algorithms guns gonna pick

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,880
and click out but the obvious ones

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,000
are race religion

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
gender name

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759
and college right so if you went to a

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,360
historically black college

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,440
you're likely not going to get out of

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
that ats

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
quickly unless they eliminate everybody

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
else and you're the only person

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
left if your last name is a last name

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
that's hard to pronounce or it doesn't

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,440
look like it's an american name

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
you're going to struggle with that as

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,440
well

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,080
if you are identified as a

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
female it's going to question you know

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,240
how old are you

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,960
so are you in the childbearing age

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
so that may be used against you if you

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,160
are

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,440
one particular religious affiliation

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
where certain days

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
you can't work or certain things have to

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
change that's going to go against you

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
now these algorithms are not intended to

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
be

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
true bias what they're intended to do is

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,680
to find the best candidate

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
but we know what the best candidate is

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,360
it's easy to find

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080
and in a lot of instances large

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,680
organization's best candidate is white

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
or asian and male women have made a lot

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,560
of

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
progress in still we have come a long

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
way

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,560
but there are less than 100

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,520
women as cios chief information officers

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
in the united states now when you think

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,800
about that in very simple terms

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,560
why is that right so you know women are

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
getting more college degrees than men

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
women are

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,720
more present more vocal you know but

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
our our the concept of what it means to

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
be a woman

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,360
for a lot of people seem that we're

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
either one of two things where the

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,720
passive

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
or aggressive and sometimes both passive

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
aggressive

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
and so if a woman is in a meeting and

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,319
she's

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,840
trying to make a point and people keep

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
interrupting her or keep

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
you know saying things in the middle of

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,280
her presentation

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,639
and she responds uh sort of like uh

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,639
what happened the other night with

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,400
kamala harris when she was talking to

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
president vice president pence

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,159
i'm speaking you're assumed to be

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,519
aggressive

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,560
if you become quiet and demure and and

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
mute yourself down well you don't have

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
the tenor to be

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,839
a leader because you don't speak up for

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
yourself

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
to extrapolate that further if you're

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,640
black

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,320
or brown male or female

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600
regards to whether you say a word

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,640
there's an assumption that you're

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
aggressive

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,920
that you are not able to maintain

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,800
a certain candor and

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
behavior that's acceptable to those who

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
see this

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,519
who makes the decision who sees your

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,680
behavior in a negative light

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,760
with emerging technologies coming along

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,240
as fast as they can

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,360
every single day black and brown people

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
are going to be the first group of

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,279
people hit

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
hardest by emerging technologies so for

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,880
example

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,120
cashierless retail

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,880
sams amazon a gazillion are going to

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,279
you put the app on your phone you scan

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200
it you press your button to pay

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
there's something on the wall that scans

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,839
your qr code

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,480
and off you go if that had been in place

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,399
prior

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,160
to covet just imagine how many companies

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,839
would not be hit

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,120
as hard as they have been economically

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,000
so my whole thought in this talk and as

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
we move forward

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
is to think about what does it mean to

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
have

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,040
a diverse and i will tell you

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
this is a talk i give probably once a

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
month

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
when you're hiring whether you're hiring

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,560
for the janitor or the president

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
the people that should be on that search

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,160
committee are

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
some of the people that person will work

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
for or work with

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,040
it should be the newest person hired in

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
your organization

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
it should be the person with the least

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
amount of experience

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
it should be colleagues that are on the

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
side so in other words

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
when you're managing up managing over

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
and managing over those managing

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,880
over people must be in the room

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,560
having a diverse group of people meaning

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
their skill sets

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,320
their race their ideas mean you get

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
a productive team member who will be

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,240
able to contribute

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,600
immediately but if you hire only what

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,959
you know so you've got a

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,320
opening for a cio a ceo a cto or

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
senior director or whatever it is and

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
you only bring senior directors or

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,959
like people into that room most of them

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,480
have already forgot

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
what they knew when they first started

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
out in this field but bringing in that

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,279
young person

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
bringing that inexperienced person

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,519
brings a different

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
dichotomy to the room so not only do you

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
have leadership and power

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
but you have a person with a different

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
point of view

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
so it is very important as we think

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,160
about

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880
where we are in terms of diversity that

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,000
we are very

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,560
clear that we cannot continue to do what

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
we have done thus far

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,079
separation of people does nothing but

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,959
make both sides weaker

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,800
we are the united states of america the

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,839
word united carries a

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,920
very powerful thing united

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
not the white america not the black

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,360
america not the asia america

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
but we are the united states of america

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,480
and yet and still to this day we live as

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,040
their separate silos right there is

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
the pine tree the magnolia tree the oak

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
tree each one lives in its own planet

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,519
they don't

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
interact with each other together and we

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,320
all know that's not the case

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
it is important that we think about

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
diversity differently and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
not to hire a chief diversity officer or

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,959
a diversity officer

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,639
if you do not empower that person to

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,519
have power to do something about issues

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,160
that arise

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,160
so if you have a black person

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,560
experiencing a

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,399
negative feeling or some kind of action

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
the diversity officer should be able to

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
bring the person to task

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
and then something is done because if

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
you don't set a tone

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
you just condone it you just condone the

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,000
behavior over and over again and that's

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
why so much we see in our society

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
that diversity is one of those things

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
that's challenged every single day

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
because it has no power

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,600
all the companies that say they believe

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,120
in diversity that advocate for diversity

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,519
look around how many people in the top

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,399
half of that organization

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,680
are white you don't believe in diversity

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
if that's the case

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
how many people in that top half are men

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
you don't believe in diversity if that's

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
the case

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,600
diversity must be diverse

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,360
homogeneous societies work in on sunday

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,279
church go to church on sundays most

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,720
churches are all white all black all

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
brown whatever it is that's the

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
homogeneous society and it works for

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,000
itself

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,880
but we're not trying to save our souls

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
to go to heaven

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
we're trying to produce and make our

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,800
company companies and organizations

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,320
productive if you are in a position

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
of leadership advocate put skin in the

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
game

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
speak for someone

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,040
help someone get to the next level

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,160
the best manager is the manager that is

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
grooming his or her replacement

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,120
and her replacement or his replacement

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
does not necessarily have to look like

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
them

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
for whatever the reason may be

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,720
so we i talked a little bit to you about

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,199
uh facial recognition but

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
this slide kind of gives you a sense of

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,920
where we are

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,079
in technologies so we have the internet

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,079
of things we have data analytics we have

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,560
robotics we have machine learning

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
artificial intelligence fintech all of

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
these things

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,160
everyone that's out there today has a

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,079
built-in bias

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,639
this bias for or bias against someone

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
it's time for us to stop talking about

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,000
this

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,560
and start doing something about it to

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,320
start

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,760
advocating and supporting one another

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,360
women should be looking for other women

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,959
to join them your ideas should be shared

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,160
not just you're in charge and you go

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
back and give a report well here's what

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
i did

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,639
here's what my team did here's what the

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
people that i work with

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,079
have done men the same thing you should

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,240
be mentoring men

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,160
across all spectrums whether they're

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
black white blue green or brown

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,279
regardless of what their sexual

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
orientation is their religion is where

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,079
they live

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,519
we need to consider diversity as it's

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,959
important to the bottom line

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,360
as the people who do diversity

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
is not just a word it's just not a

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,240
feel-good thing that someone feels good

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,639
at the end of the day because oh we've

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,079
hired a diversity officer or we've hired

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,480
two black people in this group so i

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,320
after mr floyd died in may i started

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
doing diversity chats i have a youtube

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
channel and i started doing chefs i

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,639
think i've done 188

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,000
to date and i had someone tell me

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,040
um that in order for black people to be

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,079
safe this is

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,880
in results to law enforcement and and

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,360
killing black men that they needed to be

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,759
with their white friends every day

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
and so i asked that person so when it's

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,880
time to go home go

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,920
eat i'm supposed to come spend the night

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
with you or you're supposed to come

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
spend the night with me that's how i'm

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
going to stay alive

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,040
we must undo these thoughts and these

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
ideas people have about what diversity

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
means

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
the fastest growing segment of the

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,360
population are

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
mixed race people they are outpacing

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
latinos

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
they're outpacing whites they're

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,120
outpacing every group out there

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,360
mixed race by 2040

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
according to the pew center they were

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,839
going to be parody there will be no pro

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
white no pro black no pro anything all

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
groups will be almost on a level playing

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,440
field

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,440
for us to do more with diversity we must

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,480
be inclusive in our thoughts

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
and intentional in our actions we must

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
not

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,680
second guess a decision that's there you

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,079
must speak up

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,759
as john lewis said you must get into

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
good trouble

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
that doesn't mean you are aggressive it

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
doesn't mean you're threatening it

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
doesn't mean you're challenging people

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,279
in the way they work and how they do

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
things but it means that you are

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,279
committed

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
to change

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,480
tell your story share your story and let

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,480
no one mute your voice

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,640
maintain decor

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,280
and sanity no yelling and screaming

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
no need to be threatening someone is

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
just

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
tell your story and tell your story in

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,919
the best way you can

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,480
without antagonizing the person that

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,520
you're talking to

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,079
and then when you encounter stereotypes

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,839
call it right then and there don't go

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
home don't sleep on it don't think about

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,559
because if you don't

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
you have given that person permission to

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,919
do it again

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
there are certain words that should be

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,240
forbidden from the english language

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,640
like the n word you know

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
there are ways that we use words that

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,960
bring results

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,440
if we want it to be different we must be

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
different

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,799
we must be empowered within ourselves to

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,039
work together and not see the person

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,640
sitting next to you as black or white

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,760
gay or straight male or female we must

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,120
all be

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,080
present as a community because

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,039
it takes a community to bring us to our

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:15,039
ultimate

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:17,120
result thank you

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
