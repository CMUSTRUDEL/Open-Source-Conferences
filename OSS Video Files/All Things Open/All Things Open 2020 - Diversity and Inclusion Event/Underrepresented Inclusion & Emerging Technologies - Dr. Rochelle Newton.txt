Abstract: As Covid-19 has ravaged the economy and killed hundreds of thousands of people, one should ponder the impact of the pandemic had more organizations implemented artificial intelligence and automation. Major corporations like fast food chains, retailers, and groups would have pivoted to prevent job loss, food insecurity, and displacement.

As current and emerging technologies are poised to disrupt how we live, play, and work, some of the most vulnerable communities will find access, inclusion, and understanding of these technologies challenging. The future of work is distorted now because of the pandemic. However, we the world is safe again, the haves and the have nots will move further apart. So, what can be done to prepare for these changes? Census data collected this year will provide some insights to parse fact from fiction. Unemployment numbers after Covid will also provide useful data to highlight who, what, and where of populations on fringes.

As information technologists, it is incumbent upon us to develop, and simplify what goes into the public domain with an eye on those with lesser education, experience, and knowledge as these technologies see the light of day. This presentation is meant to describe the possible difficulties for marginalized communities and identify the areas where bias and discrimination may take root and further devastate communities of color, economic disparities, and the digital divide.
