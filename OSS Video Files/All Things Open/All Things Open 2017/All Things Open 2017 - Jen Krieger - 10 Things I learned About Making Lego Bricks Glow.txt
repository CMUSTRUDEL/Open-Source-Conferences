hi everybody I'm Jen Krieger I am chief

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,200
agile architect at Red Hat however I'm

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,690
not here to talk to you about agile so

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,550
you can take a deep breath I am actually

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,400
here to talk about my second hobby which

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,560
is Legos and for all of you who cringed

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,710
when I said Legos you can come and speak

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,070
to me afterwards I know I get creamed

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,769
about that online a lot so when I first

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,439
started working with small circuits and

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,660
open source hardware technology I was

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,210
also playing with LEGOs at the time I'm

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,250
kind of a big kid and I said well geez

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,829
the one thing missing in these things

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,079
that I'm building is lighting and as I

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,120
officially learned almost immediately

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,250
because everyone told me there's

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,930
actually a kit you can buy online the

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,120
one problem with them is that they're

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,460
really expensive and so you can go to

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,280
any number one of these companies and

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,079
purchase 150 dollars worth of

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,170
pre-fabricated lights for your actual

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,370
Lego kits or you can do what I did which

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,930
was do-it-yourself however I also wanted

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,810
to see what one of these kits look like

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,810
and so as you can see on the right hand

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,280
side this is actually a picture of one

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,320
of my Legos with one of the

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,689
prefabricated kits in it and you can see

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,090
all the wires going throughout actually

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,729
the the roof and so when you actually

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,979
try to take the house apart so you can

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,810
see inside because I don't know if

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,549
anybody you know but Lego actually has

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,290
some really really cute things going

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,060
inside particularly in this one it was

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,850
the Parisian restaurant they've got a

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,590
really cool wine kind of shelf and in

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,299
the kitchen around the corner there's a

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,100
chef and he's making a turkey for the

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,320
people in the restaurant and so without

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,509
the wires you can take the roof off and

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,189
can see inside with the wires you're

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,740
kind of stuck leaving the wires where

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,840
they are number three you might go

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,759
through a little batteries and so these

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,009
are all the batteries that I used up in

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,899
making this tiny little thing up here

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,390
it's amazing this tiny little thing

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,920
consumed most of those batteries and the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,750
reason consume most of those batteries

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,119
is because I had a short in the back and

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,700
I didn't know it and so I thought when I

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,500
turned the switch to the off section

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,599
that it wouldn't actually consume the

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,489
battery but it was and so I repeatedly

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,640
gone through batteries not knowing what

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,800
I actually what was wrong

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,940
so if you're going to put holes in your

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,890
Lego like I do

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,830
you can actually melt plastic with your

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,880
dremel and so slow and easy is better

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,940
than fast and hard SMD LEDs so how many

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,730
of you have used SM DS they are super

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,069
tiny and if you try to peel them they

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,650
will fly everywhere and you will lose

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,420
half a strip of LEDs almost instantly I

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,400
cannot tell you how many of those I

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,380
found stuck to the bottom of my foot if

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,769
I've walked around my apartment barefoot

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,090
they're all over my house

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,800
troubleshooting hardware is a giant pain

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,650
in the ass that's quite frankly the only

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,150
thing I can say about it I spent hours

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,310
trying to figure out what was wrong with

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,769
these twinkle boards come to find out it

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,480
wasn't the board it was me how many of

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,160
you have had that problem before yeah

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
thank you because that makes me feel

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,840
better for hours to try to figure out

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,390
what I was doing wrong I was just

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
connecting it incorrectly seven the

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,440
right tools help so my favorite tool is

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
up on the left hand side is the

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,060
manometer that is the only thing that

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,799
works do you find the short in the

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,299
battery so you know what's actually

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,650
going wrong I also love cutter B

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,350
tweezers because they have a tiny tiny

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,420
head at the very end of them and that's

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,390
really good with those tiny tiny LEDs

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,970
that you actually saw earlier and of

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,670
course my heiko a lovely tiny little

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,900
tipped soldering iron which makes it so

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:46,230
easy to do fussy fussy work so I said

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,239
earlier that I didn't want to spend like

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,209
$100 on a prefabricated kit well guess

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,010
what it's really expensive to have this

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,019
hobby and this is only sparklin and

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,519
Adafruit it's not my Amazon account

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,859
because I was actually embarrassed to do

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,959
a screenshot of all the things I've

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,019
bought to actually make this a hobby

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,100
that that didn't make me curse

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,440
repeatedly over and over and over again

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,320
also too if you have cats it does not

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,730
help this is my cat Kip he likes to

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,600
knock some Legos all over my apartment

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,810
my other cat likes to eat them including

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,070
you might notice my sweater which I did

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,019
not notice until I pulled out of my

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,360
suitcase this morning he likes to just

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,810
basically to anything but at the end of

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
the day

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,310
the best thing about it is it is

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,500
actually really worth the effect and I

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,840
know it's really small but I will light

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,910
this one up for you and if you want to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,630
you can come see it live in person after

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,560
or you can come to my talk later this

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,260
afternoon and see this live and in

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,889
person

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,889
so thank you

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,139
