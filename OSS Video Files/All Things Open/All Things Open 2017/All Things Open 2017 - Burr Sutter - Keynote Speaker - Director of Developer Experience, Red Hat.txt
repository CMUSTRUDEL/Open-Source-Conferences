fantastic how's everyone doing very good

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,130
very good so I'm here to tell you a

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,530
story about DevOps and a death of a

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,849
zero-sum game the point of this

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,800
presentation is to make this a little

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,750
fun little energetic I'm kind of

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,949
hyperactive and I talk really fast even

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,060
though I'm originally from Hawaii and

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,560
Alabama and that's for real and the

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,869
fastest talking Hawaiian Alabamian

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,910
you'll probably ever meet but this is a

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,050
super important presentation from a lot

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,160
of perspectives and I want to go ahead

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,280
and get started and then I have a

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,110
demonstration to show you all so okay so

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,370
one is if you think of the millions of

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,960
developers that are in this world the

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,969
millions of enterprise IT software

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,410
experts whether they be an Linux

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,120
administrator and network administrator

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,219
a database administrator a software

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,469
program or script er a Python PHP

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,329
doesn't matter what you are the millions

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,210
of those people in the universe yet

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,410
there's only a few of us here today so

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,390
here's one thing I want you guys to take

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,039
away from this there's a very few elite

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,430
we're the one percenters actually where

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,460
less than 1% and developer conferences

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,170
and meetups and things of that nature

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,020
so it's critical is that you must

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,700
understand you're the hero of this story

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,040
you're the creator you're the maker

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,950
here's a developer your descriptor

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,140
you're the PlayBook maker you're

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,930
actually have a superpower that very

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,340
very few people have on this planet so

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,900
keep that in mind we're actually very

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,299
special people indeed and I think that's

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,640
super critical to understand because in

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,900
the effort of moving to a digital

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,670
transformation and thinking about

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,740
digital transformation we need to

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,880
understand that by 2020 most

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,000
organizations will be the digital

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,250
predator or digital prey so keep that in

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,710
mind we're more critical asset than ever

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,110
before there's a matter of fact and this

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,149
MIT Sloan survey 87 percent of a

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,040
surveyed executives said you know what

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,380
we're actually are worried about digital

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,380
disruption 87% said we're worried about

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,770
that yet only 44% are doing something

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,159
about it

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,140
and of those organizations only 11%

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,180
believe they have the in-house talent

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,799
and they're talking about us here in the

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,619
room today 87

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,009
44:11 the numbers really drove off

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,349
dramatically now here's a great quote

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,030
from this fellow at pointy ears

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,370
change is the essential process of all

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,230
existence and that's what we're here for

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,590
here today for we're actually change

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,390
agents now by 2018 90% of all

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,150
organizations that attempt DevOps

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,160
without addressing specifically the

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,739
cultural norms the cultural foundations

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,599
cultural transformation will fail this

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,430
is a quote specifically from the garden

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,620
organization so once you guys to think

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,060
about that for a second it focus we

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,290
focus on culture and that's why I told

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,180
you guys are the hero of the story

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,130
because if you have a culture if you

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,390
look look looks like this one we're the

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,269
developer rocking out on their

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,040
headphones you know the brogrammer doing

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,140
their thing fixing the bug running unit

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,329
tests they did it in their IDE they got

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,970
the debugging to work they think they

00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:01,000
fixed the bug they check that code in on

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,610
at 4:45 on Friday they head out to the

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,810
bar okay and actually I know the

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,519
developers you know the developers the

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,319
room we don't head out to the bar in my

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,510
specific case I head out to the soccer

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,799
field for my daughter or you know maybe

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,230
you have to head out to something for my

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,970
my son or something like that but in any

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,709
case the developer thinks they can go

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,840
and the poor operations person has left

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,280
holding the bag there the important

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,780
person who has to spend their entire

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,420
weekend in some cases to make your

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,670
crappy code run and I want you guys to

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,200
think about that and actually in several

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,880
organizations where I ran a software

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,790
engineering effort I made the developer

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,160
stay all weekend too and guess what we

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,579
had vastly better code after just two

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,170
weekends of that because if you are

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,669
accountable for running your code you

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,380
will write better code if you're

00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:46,389
accountable for making C make sure that

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,280
the users are happy and productive in

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,470
production with that code you will do it

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,870
better so we must fundamentally overcome

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,959
this wall of confusion this concept that

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,299
separates us that developers are apart

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,459
from operations and operators we have to

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,079
fundamentally tear that wall down and as

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,290
they're a matter of fact there's a great

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,910
quote from Wolverine here in the future

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,859
you and I are going to be good friends

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,019
you just don't know it yet and that is

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,880
the story of DevOps because what we must

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,889
do is actually deliver the software

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,440
package hand-in-hand together together

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,769
dev ops and the whole ecosystem of

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,810
software IT or Enterprise IT are there

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,789
to deliver better business value faster

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,600
right we're here to deliver business

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:29,240
value so it's not just a story

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,550
devyn ops it's a story of developers

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,440
maybe the security people made you be

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,730
your database administrator maybe your

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,170
enterprise architecture team your

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,140
product management office program

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,180
management office PMO QA and all these

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,980
folks have their role to play and a

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,920
software delivery process so it's more

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,720
than dev and ops its dev and security

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,940
and QA and product management and

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,500
program management etc and I love

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,150
thinking of them in these perspectives I

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,580
give them these identities because these

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,950
individuals actually you're very much

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,540
like me I said I like to think of it now

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,110
I might argue if it's Star Trek or Star

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,390
Wars

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,100
I might actually say hey mr. DBA you

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,890
look like The Walking Dead no I mean you

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,350
love The Walking Dead and I was picking

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,970
on DBAs they're not actually zombies but

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,950
it gets even better I mean if you think

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,290
of the ecosystem in which we work in I

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,900
bet your QA manager but she loves Harry

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,040
Potter you can speak to her about that

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,390
as a matter of fact you should take her

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,480
to lunch and talk about that as an

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,800
example okay we got to get through soon

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,440
for some more statistics than I want to

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,030
get to a demo but this is the puppet lab

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,820
state of DevOps report if you've not

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,960
read it I highly recommend it

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,440
high-performing organizations outperform

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,020
lower performing peers by 46 times more

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,200
deployments think about that getting to

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,780
production 46 times more often than the

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,790
lower performers you can imagine that if

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,040
you can get production 46 times more

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,630
often you can learn more you can

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,580
understand more you can feel what your

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,430
customers needs are and you can iterate

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,230
and get back out the door again okay and

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,540
as a matter of fact because you can

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,210
deploy so much faster you have a 440

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,280
time lower time to respond meaning

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,230
business values of production you can

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,950
actually take an idea and put it in code

00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,760
and get out the door 440 times faster

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,800
okay it's good to think of it like that

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,780
as a matter of fact because you're gonna

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,520
have all this high-speed access or this

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,100
high-speed capability an organization

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,440
you actually have 96 times faster trying

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,180
to recover so if there is an error where

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
you did make a mistake you recover that

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,210
much faster

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,540
now here's another great quote from the

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,580
mother of dragons Khaleesi I'm not going

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,710
to stop the wheel I'm going to break the

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,419
wheel I really like this one because

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,220
here's what software looks like in the

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,840
modern enterprise today here's what

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,370
software delivery looks like for many of

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,320
us we have this amorphous

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,520
blob and a whole gang of people trying

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,780
to push it up the hill you know you've

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,430
heard you've heard the story of pushing

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,680
the rock uphill pushing the stone uphill

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,210
in this case we don't have we don't know

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,530
what it is and there's all these people

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,150
kind of moving in different directions

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,290
trying to move it up there as a matter

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,100
of fact there's someone up there trying

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,600
to push back down on it and if you're a

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,080
developer you but I think that's the

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:07,000
operations person and I'm here to you

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,000
that's wrong that's actually the DBA or

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,979
maybe better yet you're looking at this

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,780
person at the very top well that's your

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,030
architect trying to ride herd on the

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,289
morphus blob stay in control and your

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,560
operations person is this poor

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,479
Entenmann's working on the bottom where

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,710
all your stuff is basically crushing

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,690
them crushing them under the way to that

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,729
amorphous blob and if you actually

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,229
achieve delivery this software and get

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,690
it over the hill you're gonna do it

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,389
again and again and again it's actually

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,490
inhumane it's not fun why do we do this

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,380
as a career path and so I want you guys

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,289
to think about this another great quote

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,729
from a very famous individual don't be

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,030
too proud of this technological terror

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,190
you've constructed software delivery

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,050
should look like this everybody working

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,210
together hand-in-hand to deliver the

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,889
software together a nice cohesive unit

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,020
of software in this case a nice round

00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,610
object it rolls easily so let's talk

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,070
quickly about force multipliers and then

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to give you the demonstration

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,289
hopefully there's a little bit that we

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,700
did here does encourage you to think

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,650
about DevOps in a different way

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,210
DevOps is fundamentally here to change

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,620
the way we work with each other and it's

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,990
super critical that we figure out those

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,550
cultural changes we need but there's a

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,050
bunch of cool tools that could come your

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,940
way too for instance self-service

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,349
on-demand infrastructure so in other

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,880
words I want something and I want it now

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:21,889
I don't have to wait for that I don't

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,389
have to wait weeks for that or perhaps I

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,130
need I care about automation or perhaps

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,660
I care about a deployment pipeline or

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,669
really cool blue green or canary

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,380
deployments so all these things are

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,890
certainly possible now and these are

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,500
things to give us superpowers and these

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,870
things are all available to us today all

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,979
in open source so I actually want to

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,500
show you a quick project called

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,640
fabricate and we actually have it hosted

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,930
so when they go ahead and we haven't

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,580
hosted on OpenShift

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,600
and let me put these glasses on

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,310
something see everything will and

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,870
hopefully everything has not gone to

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,090
sleep nor have I lost my network

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,710
connection in the process

00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,780
alright let's go over here so let's

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,520
watch this let's say you've adopted all

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,720
the DevOps cultural norms and now you

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,220
want to think in terms of what does it

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,320
take to build a new project I'm gonna

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,030
come over here and hit add to space this

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,490
is all host of el-shaddai oh by the way

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,840
it's the fabricate project and I'm gonna

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,970
say add a space I'm gonna pick from a

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,830
series of curated stacks right now we

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,630
only have to specifically vertex for

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,370
reactive and spring boot for a

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,200
traditional enterprise Java there'll be

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,690
more in the future where they'd be go or

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,520
Ruby or Python or PHP we're waiting for

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,770
your input and your contributions on

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,600
that I'm gonna get vertex here and I'm

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,120
gonna hit next and that basically means

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,610
I'm picking that JVM a stack with its

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,800
maven artifacts associated with it and

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,120
will actually let me get a name may my

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,760
vertex ATO and hit next here and let me

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,650
also now show you the the pipeline

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,510
selection so the next step in this

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,070
wizard specifically spec pick the

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,750
pipeline template that can be associated

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,940
with the project and you can see I have

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,920
a network connectivity issue here it's

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,630
taking a little time there we go and

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,240
there's three templates we provide on

00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,380
the Box one a continuous integration

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,340
project so this is Jenkins we're going

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,170
to configure Jenkins for you

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,520
automatically so I can do continuous

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,190
integration fairly straight in the

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,540
fridge to earthward way the other is do

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,700
conduce integration and roll it out the

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,650
stage and the last one is roll it out to

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,390
stage and then wait for manual approval

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,610
to roll it out to runtime environment

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,620
I'm going it next year and just select

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,270
that default option so if you look at it

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,650
I'm just taking all the default options

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,980
other than giving my project a name and

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,810
then I'm gonna hit finish now a lot has

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,310
happened in this wizard I have self

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,780
served I didn't wait for anybody to give

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,040
me a virtual machine I didn't wait two

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,300
weeks or three weeks or six weeks

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,100
depending on where you work for a

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,230
virtual machine I'm getting all those

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,390
resources for me automatically I have a

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,120
github project now set up for me I

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,339
picked from a selected set of curated

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,260
stacks perhaps maybe my operations team

00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,940
is chosen what these things look like

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,980
and here I'll click on this project and

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,140
you can see specifically here is the

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,760
source code it is a maven based project

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,830
and there's the Jenkins file for that

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,450
pipeline Jenkins in this case uses a

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,360
pipeline definition informative groovy

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,620
and we have that out there and you can

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,910
kind of see the pipeline's should be

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,860
kicking off here in the background build

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,089
number one has already started we're

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,510
fully automated with a full deployment

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,950
pipeline now the last thing else

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,420
show you this so that by itself is

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,730
pretty cool I installed nothing I did

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,080
nothing other than click but now let's

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,420
say if I want to change the code I'm

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,100
gonna hit create workspace here and that

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,810
actually takes a few moments to run and

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,860
so what I'll do is well let it get

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,140
started but I'll show you what I already

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,180
have running but the create workspace is

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,220
incredibly powerful this is based on a

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,220
project called Eclipse J it's a full

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,470
browser-based cloud native IDE and you

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,240
install nothing on your laptop and you

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,680
have the full ready to go and

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
development environment as a matter of

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,180
fact let me actually switch windows

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,340
because already have one running ok this

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,230
is a full Linux environment I can come

00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,430
over here now and I'm interacting with

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,140
the Linux container running on the

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,060
server this is all open ship this is all

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,790
kubernetes this is a Linux container

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,910
running back here I can even run top on

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,590
it so I have a full Linux setup for me

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,720
again completely self-service fully

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,880
automated and I can come up here now and

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,170
run that code so in this case it is my

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,970
programming editor right here

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm gonna run the programming

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,660
environment and by the way I can even

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,790
come over here and mess with a little

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,680
bit router ok and you know it has a it's

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,910
a full IDE and they're words that

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,220
actually just syntax highlighting and

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,160
checking and it'll do that change for

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,390
you but let's see here you'll notice

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,820
also that it's actually running in real

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,140
time making changes happen on the fly so

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,450
it's just like Google Docs from that

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,000
perspective you can see it says hello if

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,250
I want to change this to Bonjour right

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,910
well don't spell Bonjour correctly

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,330
that's ok

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,520
you know it's live and hit refresh here

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,160
there we go and maybe I want to make

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,540
this Aloha write originally I could say

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,660
howdy or hey y'all but we'll go Aloha

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,070
and let's see here all right so you can

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,320
see it's dynamically hot redeploying

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,600
treating job as a programmatic language

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,980
in this case and let's and this is by

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,150
the way it's all unique to me I can

00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,380
share this with my product manager and

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,600
share this with the rest of my team I

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,070
can say come look at this URL the URL is

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,150
live you actually want to get on it you

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,710
could do it right now on your phone and

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,570
I know it's too much to type but you can

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,190
interact and with my application I could

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,660
show my users is this what you wanted me

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,970
to do is this the change you want me to

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,340
make to the API and they can say yes and

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,530
I say great I'm gonna check it in so let

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,910
me go here and do a git commit all right

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,720
and I'm gonna say I want this to be

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,260
Aloha

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,050
I'm going

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,760
push my changes and hit commit here so

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,010
now my get commit is working you'll see

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,960
that message and notification that they

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,370
actually accepted my commit and it's

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,560
going to go out to github and then we're

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,960
gonna see a new build kick off a new

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,520
pipeline run so just keep that in mind

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,170
we fully automated this entire

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,660
environment I can basically start

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,890
working I got a full on me pipeline I

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,050
completed self-service this is all

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,220
running as kubernetes pods you know

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,890
running here in the background I even

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,690
have my turbinates connected when I turn

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,730
my Eclipse che pod specifically because

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,850
even Shay itself is running as a pod in

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,230
this case in the kubernetes world and so

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,090
that's what we're doing and that's the

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,390
fabricate project so we got to wrap up

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:04,500
here so let's jump back into the slide

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,600
deck here okay so fabricate i/o and open

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,970
show specifically and let me leave you

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,150
with one more or two more quotes

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,190
actually I love this one our ancestors

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,650
called it magic but you call it computer

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,990
science and a land where I come from

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,280
they are one of the same and so one

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,990
thing I want you to keep in mind you do

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,030
have these new superpowers available to

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,770
you if you adopt the DevOps mindset and

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,960
move in that category you're going to

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,220
have a lot more success but it's super

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,170
important that you understand that with

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,010
great power also comes great

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,020
responsibility

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,460
this was not stayed by Uncle Ben by the

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,080
way that's what the movie said but in

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,480
the real comic book it was actually just

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,090
a voiceover if you will by Stan Lee who

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,710
wrote that so this is me on Twitter or

00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,120
hit me up on email if you have any

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,290
questions I would love to hear from you

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,210
hopefully you found this to be

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,650
entertaining and energizing and I really

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,460
appreciate your time so thank you so

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,419

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,419
