	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
devices and the idea behind it right now

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,280
is that the technology world has this

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,650
tendency to always seem to look

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,900
backwards and it solves yesterday's

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,400
problems the idea is that right now all

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,350
the smart devices that we're seeing

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,260
particularly consumer but even in some

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,180
cases IOT their cute little eye devices

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,150
with our own little eye a p-- that go to

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,070
their iCloud and it's a very much trying

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,750
to kind of capture the user and kind of

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,789
own the user for a particular product

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,420
and that's kind of how things were done

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,340
last year and if we believe in the IOT

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
at all it's going to be thousands of

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,360
devices and the idea of having thousands

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,550
of apps and thousands of silos of course

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,410
makes no sense so the idea of this

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,899
coming zombie apocalypse is referring to

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,860
just the sheer volume of things that are

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,829
coming and how we have to think

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,920
differently about it but I need to

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,460
manage your expectation a little bit oh

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,109
that looks quite nice okay so this is

00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
Pablo Picasso and there's one is my

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,449
favorite quotes from him computers are

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,049
useless they only give you answers now

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,850
the talk today is not about giving you

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,909
answers it's not about trying to sell

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,640
you any particular product I'm here to

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,350
ask questions I'm here to provoke a

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,049
little bit for us to think about where

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,460
we need to be going so I want a minute

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,770
I'm not going to be giving you a laundry

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,360
list of a particular github repos for

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,920
you to be working on today it's more or

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,320
less what we as a community should be

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,329
doing differently to support IOT because

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
the issue with IOT right now is it as

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,329
this weird collection of very different

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,829
products we've got smart like socket so

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,840
you can plug into your wall there's

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,220
industrial sensor networks that can kind

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,710
of measure the temperature of an entire

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,630
building you've got this ambiguous thing

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,140
called the smart home and you've got

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,659
chat BOTS like Amazon Alexa and these

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,649
are all very different products and yet

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,750
they're all just kind of oh yeah it's

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,700
IOT just that's just we're just

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,110
connecting things and I believe it needs

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,759
a little bit more structure for us to

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,990
talk about this because each one of

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,210
these requires a very different things

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,040
and of course the real question is

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,060
what's the role that open-source has to

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,430
play in all of this so whenever we talk

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,990
about a future concept let's say we're

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,680
talking about like I don't know

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,020
future vision of transportation right

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,960
and we could have big visionary thoughts

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,700
of where we want to go but what we often

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,490
forget is that we have to build that

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,350
with the tools that we currently have so

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,280
if we have this grand vision of a Lexus

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,170
and all we have our Legos this is what

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,140
we're going to build we're gonna build a

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,060
Lexus out of Legos now it's Alexis yeah

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,310
I got close but it's not really what we

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,730
originally had in mind and I have my

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,250
argument is that we are building the IOT

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,860
out of the technological Legos of the

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,930
80s and the 90s and we are only just

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,060
kind of we're being held back by what

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,550
they're capable of doing so we're using

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,260
the wrong tools and what I'm trying to

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,630
get us to do as a community is to kind

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,430
of figure out where we need to be going

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,500
especially as an open source thing

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,220
because what I'd like to do is use a UX

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,890
lens take a look at what users both

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,290
industrial and commercial need for the

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:18,030
IOT s to succeed and then figure out how

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,320
that can be improved upon now I this is

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,450
the first time I've given this kind of

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,070
talk before and I kind of wanted to

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,760
anticipate a question that you might be

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,590
asking right now Scott really UX like

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,360
what would you X have to do with

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,890
low-level networking protocols but

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,920
that's exactly what I'm trying to make

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:39,720
the point here is that this is my job

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,000
right my job is putting lipstick on a

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,850
pig if you have ever tried making an IOT

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,220
app you do dialog boxes like this no

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,150
Wi-Fi available figure it out yourself

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,190
sucker and this is like guys we need to

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,140
move beyond these primitive building

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,110
blocks that basically punt it to the

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,770
user whenever anything goes wrong this

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,780
is not us this is just basically coping

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,450
with bad technology and now whenever you

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,400
do talk about IOT type things you often

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,830
get this seven layer stack and I found

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,450
lots of seven layer stacks but each one

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,160
had its own particular flavor I didn't

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,140
want you guys to obsess over which

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,850
particular stack I picked but what's

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,130
important is at the bottom one right

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,200
here is some low level physical thing

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,030
like 802 11 15 for just pick your

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,280
favorite low level transport protocol

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,970
don't care but at the top at the very

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,880
top

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,200
little thing called applications yes all

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,850
the important stuff fits in this top a

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,670
little layer right here is that come on

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,170
there's like so much more than the idea

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,910
is that all you have to do is just plug

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,700
a couple api's together and you'll be

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,440
fine it's like no it's a lot more than

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,570
that in fact I would argue that UX has

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,970
to go much deeper than that in fact the

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,760
whole purpose of this talk is to say

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,800
that we need to push UX much much deeper

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,620
so that we can build these things these

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,740
are our Lego bricks these are the things

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,810
that we have around and I would argue

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,390
actually become our lenses through which

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,160
we see the whole world we just assume

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,660
you've got to have a Wi-Fi password we

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,670
just assume that you've got to have a

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,900
particular Bluetooth stack and you know

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,030
what the user just has to deal with it

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,880
it's like no we don't we can think

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,690
bigger thoughts so the goal here is to

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,180
say can we envision some UX motivated

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,320
layers some improvements to this stack

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,240
that will make IOT significantly better

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,400
so let me just tell a little story that

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,050
might help a little bit this is more

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,419
from the history of classical design

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,800
versus computational design but it talks

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,260
about the fact that the steering wheel I

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,000
actually had a Twitter chat about three

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,050
or four years ago at someone who was

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,340
like we just need to standardize on

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,950
things like a steering wheel we've had

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,990
the steering wheel forever I'm like no

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,280
we actually haven't that it's a

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,760
misunderstanding that the steering wheel

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,979
is the standardized thing the original

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,900
steering wheel was actually came from

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,720
the when the first car was built it was

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,310
based on a boat and a boat has a tiller

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,680
in the back of the boat so guess what

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,850
the very first cars it's really fun to

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,800
look this up was effectively a tiller in

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,200
the back and the tiller turned the

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,880
wheels so the back wheels so to go left

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,560
you had to push the tiller to the right

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,229
the exact opposite we do today with

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,210
wheels and then of course they kind of

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,500
figured out that having the wheels in

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,229
the back wasn't really the right thing

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,370
to do so they then moved the tiller to

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,800
the front but it was still a tiller

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,260
right now at this point they were

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,660
experimenting with wheels and it ended

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,370
up being really hard because of the

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,550
infrastructure of the time was really

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,289
bad roads very bumpy roads and the kind

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,030
of the technological abilities the time

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,030
made for the gearing quite if

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,650
so they tried actually having a wheel it

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,780
was like really hard to hold and would

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,760
like jerk a lot so people actually would

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,830
prefer having tillers when they had the

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,230
choice because wheels were bad they were

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,310
bad wheels so the design was right the

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,870
execution was wrong

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,130
so eventually though when things

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,650
improved they eventually of course

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,420
finally got to the wheel but what I

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,820
found fascinating is when they started

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,860
putting wheels in cars people actually

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,660
consumers rejected it now this quote

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,880
comes from a really good book called

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,070
user unfriendly the steering wheel has

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,370
met with such general disfavor in this

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,560
country that levers tillers are used

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,560
almost exclusively now as a designer

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,530
this is amazing to me they were given

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,120
the right thing and they rejected it and

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,790
it's so easy to kind of go oh those

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Victorians they're so silly but it's

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,930
like no it actually was a difficult

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,220
issue about the fact that early steering

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,690
wheels were bad and they just had bad

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,240
experiences and they kind of imprinted

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,000
on it and this isn't in fact the general

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,400
shape of almost any innovation that we

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,790
do today we have some crazy cool concept

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,710
and then we start to build it out excuse

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,250
me we build it out and we get our first

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,770
prototype in this case the tiller and as

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,450
we start to build it users in a sense

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,250
fall in love with it it becomes what I

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,890
kind of call an intellectual gravity

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,540
well we kind of get used to our prison

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,980
this is how it works

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,080
this is how it's been working this is

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,420
how it'll keep working and we actually

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,480
start to be reluctant to experience new

00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,640
ideas and eventually we then slowly

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,850
refine our way out of the problem but it

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,060
takes time and it's a whole complicated

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,220
stew of Technology insights consumer

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,390
acceptance so to a certain extent I want

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,720
to give us a little cut us a little

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:27,630
slack this is the long arc of design of

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,190
general technological innovation it just

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,110
takes a while for us to get our heads

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,470
around this problem but we should

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,810
appreciate the fact that sometimes what

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,640
holds us back is us we get stuck in

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,440
these gravity wells we get stuck by our

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,510
Lego bricks and we just assume that

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,700
what's the point of changing it's just

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,650
how it is

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,800
so the argument I would make is that the

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,310
IOT started off as a cool crazy idea and

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,650
we've had a couple of really weird

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,060
have been proposed by the IOT but this

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,190
is where we're at we're at the prototype

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,080
stage and we have to be careful that we

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,610
just don't get too enamored with the

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,930
things that we currently have working we

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,990
need to always think I think a little

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,270
bit bigger so let me give you an example

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,740
of what I mean by this and stop using

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,140
historical things we'll start using

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,970
smart lights smart lights is a fun idea

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,200
and it's already been useful to an awful

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,240
lot of people but what was the very

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,850
first smart light thing that we saw it

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,040
was the hue light bulb which makes total

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,810
sense super easy to do you just unscrew

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,650
your old one put your new one in and

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,770
tada

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,540
smart lamp so from that point of view it

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,160
was that's kind of our tiller it was

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,250
just replacing the existing lighting

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,330
system but then what happened you

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,160
started getting three or four of them

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,110
and then of course your spouse walks

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,600
over and kind of goes oh I'll just turn

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,690
off the light switch and now that is a

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,950
very very dumb light bulb right because

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,410
when you flip the switch off it has no

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,240
more power anymore how many people here

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,250
have seen people that installed Philips

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,020
light bulbs and they took like large

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,400
pieces of plastic and then glue them

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,930
onto their light switches you can buy

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,030
these tabs right now at hardware stores

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,050
you can actually buy tabs to turn off

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:05,690
your on/off switch clear sign of a pain

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,130
point right there so that clearly

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,839
implies that we need to then kind of

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,190
evolve and refine a little bit so then

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,320
we started getting smart light switches

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,210
which of course makes a lot more sense

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
I learnt smart light switch is a lot

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,780
more flexible can never you know turn

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,610
off and that kind of stuff but it's

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,230
harder it takes more infrastructure

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,089
you've got like you know more labor

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,100
involved so there's clearly a trade-off

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,650
there but if you were building a smart

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,970
home today I would argue the vast

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,740
majority your smart lighting would be

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,980
through switches not through light bulbs

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,950
and by the way I'm not trying to poopoo

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,120
or talk down lifx or Phil you know he

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,800
Phillips you those are great products

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,510
and they will continue have a need I'm

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,240
just saying we'll get more sophisticated

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,720
as we go but what happens though is that

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,209
we're still solving the old problem

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,920
which is primarily ceiling lights so

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,380
imagine I now have these smart lights in

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,450
my house and I walk into my bedroom and

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,790
the light turns on ok for them a motion

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,459
sensor that's great but then I walk in

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,310
and my wife is taking a nap

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:05,540
and the light goes on hey I just did not

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,529
make someone very happy

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,910
right now and of course that's the

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,490
that's the problem auda Meishan it can

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,949
be kind of clunky and tone-deaf but the

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,550
true IOT pay tree will say that's easy

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,529
to fix

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,820
we'll just add more sensors we'll put a

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,990
sensor in the bed and we'll know

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,149
someone's sleeping so when you walk in

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,910
it won't turn on I'm like well you've

00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:25,069
solved my immediate problem but then

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,380
when I walk in I still don't get any

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,000
lights and of course there's still the

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,230
issue that when I walk into my dog is on

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,269
the bed it won't go on and I'm like

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,060
thanks so the idea is that you just

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:36,620
can't keep adding sensors to the problem

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,940
it's like sensors all the way down well

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,250
just enough sensors will fix everything

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,800
and that's kind of a simplistic rule

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,060
based model of thinking I would think a

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,089
much better model is for us to

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,680
understand that we're being held back by

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,940
the concept of the light it's the

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,639
ceiling light the ceiling light is a

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,839
very dangerous light to turn on what

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,660
would happen if we said wait a second

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,880
we've got IOT technology now we can

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,709
actually decoupled the light and think

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,930
about and deconstructed a bit we could

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,699
actually have like path lighting whether

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,399
it's you know at the entrance to the

00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:08,690
room around the baseboard very light

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,019
light so that if I walked into the

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,550
bedroom

00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,649
imagine the system would kind of go oh

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,819
there's no one in the room my sensor

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,430
says nothing I'll just turn on the

00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:18,220
lights but wait a second I detect that

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,480
someone is in here I'd better be careful

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,519
what I'll do instead is we'll turn on

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,990
the glow lights around so at least you

00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,029
don't kill yourself when you walk around

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,610
the room and then what I'll probably do

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,800
is take a wall switch light they they

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,589
will probably still exist and have it

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,600
maybe blink or - no - so it says you

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,639
know Scott I wanted to turn the lights

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,040
on but I couldn't but but if you want to

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,709
I'll do it here so that way the system

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,510
kind of has the humility to understand

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,060
that there are ambiguous situations and

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,370
so we do part of the job the job that is

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,380
not risky and then allow it to overflow

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,149
and if you want to get really fancy you

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,160
could have the switch BT or Smart Watch

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,779
you could do voice commands you could do

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,579
other things as well but you see what

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm saying is we're starting to realize

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,939
that it's the old model of lighting

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,519
that's holding us back and we can use

00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,560
the very power of IOT to create a more

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,779
nuanced system but this is just the

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,130
start now that we've kind of decoupled

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,839
the ceiling light from other lights we

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,559
can actually have much more nuance

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,619
tonight dare I say fun concepts of

00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,669
completely sporadic open sparse lighting

00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:22,299
you could imagine a room filled with

00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:24,189
dozens of lights very creatively done to

00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,829
light corners and nooks to create unique

00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:29,079
patterns so you could have a beautifully

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:30,789
artistic room lighted in a way that

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,859
would be impossible by today's standards

00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:35,019
and that's just simply going from 1 to

00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:36,129
12 lights and if you really wanted to be

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,139
cool you could actually have the lights

00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,359
like Ripple when you turn on so it'd

00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,799
just be kind of awesome and just create

00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,689
a kind of an emotional impact to the

00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,789
room and I'm not even talking about

00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,649
adding information like if it's blue

00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:50,169
it's cold outside or that kind of

00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:52,149
silliness the programmers like to do I

00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:53,859
mean yes we like information but

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,079
sometimes let's be clear we want emotion

00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,999
we want you have aesthetics and I would

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,559
love to see the IOT move to a lighting

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,199
system where we're only worried about

00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,309
aesthetics and emotion if anybody's seen

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,779
the new Blade Runner there's a really

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,089
cool scene where the room was lit with

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,819
kind of like wavering waves of light

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:11,469
would be awesome but and we could

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:15,039
consider that with new ideas so my point

00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:17,529
being is that as we do more and more IOT

00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,899
we will change from tillers to steering

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,999
wheel's we will evolve the very products

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,220
themselves and that is to me what's

00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:27,129
truly exciting with IOT but that'll take

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,529
some time so the key thing that I have

00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,149
learned especially as a designer

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,189
consulting both inside and outside of

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,379
Google is that we tend to use tomorrow's

00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:37,989
technology to solve yesterday's problems

00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:39,939
it's a natural human thing we just do

00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:42,039
that and we just recognize it so I don't

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:43,089
to be critical but we have to realize

00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,549
that we don't want that to hold us back

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,369
we have to realize that we will then

00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,709
create new problems and new models

00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:52,659
that'll happen but do we have the the

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:54,459
right things in place was to think about

00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,259
that so let's talk about ways in which

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,209
we can make that work so I want to

00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:02,019
propose a very simple framework to talk

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:03,879
about IOT expose the UX pain points that

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,639
are felt by that and then talk about the

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,259
UX goals that would motivate specific

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,409
changes that we could take to the IOT

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,609
stack so that I'm not at all trying to

00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,959
come up with a complete solution here

00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,359
like I said this is a series of

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,649
questions so I want to make sure that we

00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,449
kind of talk it through and I'll

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,279
probably just do a part of the total

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,779
solution but hopefully it'll create some

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,179
vocabulary we could start talking about

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,489
this so let's start with a simple

00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:28,400
continuum of going from a single device

00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,830
to a swarm of

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,420
of Isis and just say what happens along

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,490
that continuum because we start off by

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,770
having a smart outlet that works nice

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,990
and that's the kind of the beginning at

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,960
the bottom at the very top we have a

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,950
swarm of sensors so yeah a sensor

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,900
network of some kind

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,630
the ideas they both have a single

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,490
function one turns on power one receives

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,960
temperature settings they just one does

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,610
it as an individual one does it as a

00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,140
group and then we will slide in between

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,290
those as we get more and more

00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,350
sophisticated but most of us today have

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,540
experience start with an outlet and then

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,060
move to lights and then probably have a

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,740
smart lock and start to slowly build

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,010
this up and what we're discovering of

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,020
course is that each one has its own

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,360
application so we're already kind of

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,100
under uncovering the fact that we have

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,710
effectively a series of individual

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,470
things so what ends up happening is we

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,910
turn to products like if T just has

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,950
anybody heard of if T just curious your

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,450
hand yes of course if T is not

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,770
necessarily the only solution out there

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,750
but it's a good solution that basically

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,130
says hey I want to you know do one

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,290
command I want to fire a bunch of things

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,240
off so it helps us kind of do this idea

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,580
of swarm management it's our first

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,620
understanding is as we start to get more

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,330
and more devices we need to have things

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,090
to help us manage these multiple devices

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,710
but as these devices get smarter we've

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,630
realized that they can actually start to

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,880
talk to each other right so the door

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,260
lock can fire off an event and then that

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,240
fires off an event the light can go on

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,100
and so things get more interesting and

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,250
now we realize that we have this issue

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,540
of control it's not enough just to

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,160
simply fire off a command and have

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,360
things happen we want these things to

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,700
start to roll and this is where smart

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,560
routers come in our smart hubs if you've

00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,030
seen like a smartthings hub or something

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,740
like that which starts to have these

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,720
rule-based systems that says if this

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,230
then that locally within your within

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,370
your your network so this is kind of an

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,660
strategy of control I believe this

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,890
actually gives us the ability to talk

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,350
about the next dimension here which is

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,390
to go from direct devices to distributed

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,280
devices and what I mean by this is that

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,510
it now gives us these quadrants so in

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,210
the bottom of left corner is what I'd

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,190
call a direct device and for the most

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,830
part this is like every product you have

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,810
ever seen in IOT right is a direct

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,150
device and whether it's a smart outlet

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,820
or a by the way has anybody seen quirky

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,900
egg minder rookie egg minder was one of

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,520
those things that ends up on the

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,610
twitterfeed internet oh if you guys

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,710
have seen the Internet of it's

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,150
actually a very worthwhile and I think

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,680
it's healthy thing for us to talk about

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,660
because it it talks about the value

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,559
aspect of IOT cuz some of these things

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,930
are a bit crazy

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,430
the quirky egg miner is a smart tray for

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,200
eggs in the refrigerator and you put

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,280
your eggs in them and then when you're

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,370
out in the store and you're kind of

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,820
going gee I wonder if I have any eggs I

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,080
know I've got quirky and you can see

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,190
that you've got three eggs and how old

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,620
they are then you can buy some more eggs

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,390
and it's fun to make fun of these things

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,940
because but honestly I think this is

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,679
this kind of creative energy that comes

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,000
from all this stuff and so we all find

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,440
things that aren't quite as interesting

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,780
and some that are a lot more interesting

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,640
but my point though is that all of these

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,920
devices are direct quirky has its own

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,330
app everything has its own app and we're

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,100
playing with that right now now at the

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,300
very top we'll talk about the thing we

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,870
dimension before which is the sensor

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,820
network so that's this all direct kind

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,309
of devices today and so that original

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,140
line that I drew drew is really starts

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,090
over here this is where most of the

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,510
world is right now and we can kind of

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:50,179
push out a tiny bit if we include things

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,340
like smart hubs or if T things like that

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,420
the bottom end and at the top end we

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,070
might have something like a smart

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,330
parking lot I don't if you guys have

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,150
seen these but effectively they have a

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,670
sensor network that detects a car and if

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,880
you are in the parking if you drive in

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,020
it'll flip an LED from green to red so

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,400
that way you can kind of look down an

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,720
aisle and see all red and you know

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,190
there's no cars there and if you see a

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,230
couple of green you can kind of zip down

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,990
there it's quite nice but it's still

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,600
direct at the bottom I tend to control

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,660
the outlet with my phone and at the top

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,429
I control the parking lot with my car

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,050
it's a swarm and they're both directly

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,700
controlled ok so that's what I'm trying

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,870
to get with this matrix here now if we

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,640
move over to this one we get the

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,530
distributed swarm and the idea about

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,410
being distribute is this thing doesn't

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,780
require me to push a button or to use my

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,550
phone it responds it just knows that

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,500
people are in the house it responds to

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,030
the lights and the temperatures it could

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,580
even cook it can do all sorts of things

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,440
the idea is that you just exist and it

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,090
just responds to you that's the dream

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,250
and that's the smart house that

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,780
everyone's trying to shoot for now this

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,190
is a lot more aspirational but this is

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,130
clearly a good dish in for us to have

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,810
now the bottom right hand corner felt a

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,030
little bit odd it

00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,580
first because we can see all these

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,900
things being kind of building up to the

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,490
corner but the bottom right is like a

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,780
device that's distributed it almost

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,880
seems like an oxymoron how can one

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,010
device be distributed it's just one

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,140
device but the idea is that the smart

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:14,350
house isn't going to be one monolithic

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,500
system it will be a system of systems

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,930
and so most likely the virtual

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,210
distributed device will be something

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,560
like not like a chatbot that's what

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,480
people would think about like like

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,670
Amazon echo that really belongs over

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,620
there right that's more of a device that

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,170
you can talk to that then like if T

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,960
issues commands in fact Alexa uses if T

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,850
so what I'm referring to more is the

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,710
idea that you would have a system that

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,180
would then be a part of the house so

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,520
you're in a room and you say turn on the

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,900
lights so it detects that someone said

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,310
turn the lights it knows what room

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,480
you're in it knows who you are it knows

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,520
your preferences that knows the time of

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,170
day it knows who else is in the room it

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,140
can make an intelligent decision as to

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,950
what turn on the lights means so I would

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,120
argue this is a very embryonic concept

00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,980
that really hasn't been discussed much

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,680
yet but I would argue we would will take

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,140
groups of these distributed devices and

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:10,060
use them to create a swarm in the case

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,500
of the smart house so the problem I have

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,140
is that whenever I talk to people to IOT

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,910
we get the crazy professor again that

00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,100
kind of goes hey I got one of these

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,520
little smart I would let's I got six

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,290
more

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,580
I want to make me a smart house they

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,190
just feel like well hey if I just get

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,870
six more I'm done and I'm like well

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,830
there might be a few issues there let's

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,830
talk about I think it's much more

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,020
important for us to not go straight to

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,210
the thing that we want but to actually

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,070
break it up into pieces let's talk about

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,350
what it means to have multiple devices

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,610
and just talk about that pain and then

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,350
after we have that let's talk about what

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,030
it means to have distributed devices and

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,070
that just gives us a way to kind of

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,180
tease the problem out talk about a

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:51,910
little more so let's talk about by the

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,700
way has anybody here set up more than

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,820
five smart devices in their house okay

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,680
so I I think I'll be we can you know

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,410
share our pain together after the talk

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,670
because if you have tried to set up a

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,840
something in your house let's say for

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,670
example you wanted to go all out you

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,660
want to have a whole bunch of lights in

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,520
so you put in a whole bunch of smart

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,840
lights and and whether it's

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,640
light bulbs are smart switches is

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,690
plumbing I don't care you just have some

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,040
kind of smart light in your house and

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,960
then you distribute a bunch of smart

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,900
motion sensors okay

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,630
this is what you want right this is what

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,840
you think you're building but then as

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,330
you basic step one is every one of these

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,160
requires a Wi-Fi password every one of

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,530
these requires an encryption key every

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,960
one of these requires some kind of WPA

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,210
type check you look so you've spent an

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,110
entire weekend just turning these damn

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,450
things on right that's step one step two

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:47,800
is it isn't even close to being a map

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,810
what you get is this a gigantic list of

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,150
things with hexadecimal names that kind

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,430
of goes hey we can do anything you want

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,080
any one of these motion sensors can turn

00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,390
on any one of these lights it's like

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,860
thanks so what you have to do is you've

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,390
got to then manually go through and why

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,400
are these things up wire them up

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,510
logically so you look and say this is

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,600
what it means to turn on the kitchen

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:10,030
light we have just met invented the

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,230
smart parking lot in our home but

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,520
instead of being an industrial thing

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,340
we're asking people to wire this stuff

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,790
up manually this is crazy and heaven

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,050
forbid one of your lightbulbs breaks

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,250
because if your lightbulbs breaks guess

00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,230
what you've got to rewire the thing all

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,420
over again so this is an absolute

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,490
nightmare and it's one of the reasons I

00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,860
would argue that smart homes are not

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,800
taking off it's just too much pain

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,090
involved so what would happen let's just

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,650
roll up our sleeves a little bit and

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,010
talk about the ways in which this could

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,720
be better

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,850
imagine you actually had a map of your

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,040
house a map that was semantically marked

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,450
up so it's the living room with a door

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,980
on the east and the west side and

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,050
there's an outside door and inside doors

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,060
and you actually had a system that could

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,640
locate things so that when I added a

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,040
light and a motion sensor the system the

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,030
network would recognize oh look I have

00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,550
got a new light it is of type light and

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,440
it is in the living room and by the way

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,850
I also have a new sensor it's a motion

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,190
sensor and it's in the living room by

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,630
the West door it recognizes that these

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,700
things are actually needed to be

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,320
configured puts them into a safe corner

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,630
of the network so they can't do any

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,090
damage and then just simply tells you

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,320
hey Scott I got two new things do you

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,120
want to hook them up and you I just plug

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,500
them in yes I do and if you want to be

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,210
really secure you could have some kind

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,400
of hardware click to be extra extra

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,510
secure I don't want to

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,920
security ruins everything sorry the

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,070
fastest way to ruin a product is to add

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,560
security to it now by the way I don't

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,480
mean that really because I'm a deep

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,430
believer in security what I mean is

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,320
what's what the quickest way to ruin a

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,010
product is to add securely security

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,750
poorly to a product but the problem is

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,010
most security is on poorly and so you

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,780
just have to kind of fiddle around all

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,670
this stuff but the point is the system

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,350
would discover these things show them to

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,970
you and you'd say yeah and you'd add

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,130
them and then they'd just be there on

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,290
your network which is really really nice

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,090
and better yet because it knows it in

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,010
the same room the system if you have a

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,720
smart router can say guess what just for

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,250
default I'm gonna set these things up so

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,380
that when I detect motion I'm gonna turn

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,790
this light on for you now you can go and

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,490
figure it out later and but by default

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,020
it works quite nicely but what's really

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,760
fun as I had two more lights and one

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,500
more motion sensor and now we can get

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,030
even more assistance in goes oh look I

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,400
haven't got three lights and I got two

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,760
motion sensors I'll just work it out for

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,350
you it'll just work I mean yes I'm sure

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,790
we can envision more sophisticated

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,140
lighting things but wouldn't it be great

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,720
if we lived in a world where this was

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,820
possible and on top of that it even

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,070
opens up the role to machine learning

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:39,210
because now if I have a system that says

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,440
oh look the East effectively Y motion

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,150
sensor got tripped first and then the

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,890
West I can detect that you're walking

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,840
through the room and if I can if you

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,850
continually have that motion the route

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,080
the room outside the West door I'll turn

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,420
on the light for that before you get

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,520
there so we can have all sorts of really

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,330
fun things happening with just simply a

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,740
smart network in a smart map so in a

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,680
sense the pain points that I've

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,180
discovered here is around by the way

00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,380
this is both consumer and industry

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,450
focused by the way I don't want us to be

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,760
only thought of as a as a consumer talk

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,560
is that we have a huge issue around

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,120
setup for devices and we have a huge

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,400
issue on maintenance - speaking of all

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,900
to hook these things up so the goals are

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,490
what I called the four things I just

00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,310
talked about but I'm going to call them

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,780
out to make sure we got them all

00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,970
standard descriptions you know if you've

00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,640
heard of schema.org if you've heard

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,070
about Sousa or SS and these are

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,520
effectively just schemas that explain

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,230
what devices are not only that but I

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,700
believe ZigBee has got one the Bluetooth

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,760
mesh has got one these exist

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,529
they're out there so my first plea to

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,240
you is to understand that schemas are

00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,309
out there if you're working on products

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
try to use one of them at least so that

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,330
we can start to all agree that these

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,830
devices should be self describing the

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,529
other one is this about the idea of Auto

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,539
configuration and this was actually

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,000
demonstrated about two weeks ago when

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,559
the echo plus was demoed they showed a

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,630
ZigBee light being turned on for the

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,610
first time broadcasting in configuration

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,220
mode and the echo found it and set it up

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:08,070
for you it was a very simple great first

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,630
step but we need to kind of think let's

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,549
just keep going let's just not start

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,809
with that so my previous project at

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,570
Google is something called the physical

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,340
web which was broadcasting URLs around

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,320
so you interact with any web page in any

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,909
location but imagine instead of it

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,570
broadcasting a web page you just

00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:26,700
broadcasted a URL to a JSON blob and

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,460
that JSON blob can be anything it would

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,049
be this is the schema that I use I use

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,250
SSH I use sosa

00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:36,750
I am a light this is my this is how I

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,269
want to be configured I use this

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,639
Bluetooth you know spec this is my

00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,919
validation server right so then what you

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:45,450
could do is contact securely device pull

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,590
out out the key from the device past

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,210
this validation server and the

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,340
validation server goes yep that actually

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,590
is a Philips light bulb so now when I

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,049
turn on my 18 light bulbs the system can

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,029
say I've double-checked and you have 18

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,639
valid hue light bulbs do you wanna put

00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:01,799
them all in network yes I do so to me

00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:03,450
this is we have all the Lego bricks the

00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,889
technical Lego bricks to build this

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,740
today we just need to start to kind of

00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:10,529
build the systems to do it that's wrong

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,360
direction so semantic Maps is probably

00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,740
the easiest one technically because

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,750
there's there's a bunch of math

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,950
standards we'd use the existing schemas

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,139
to say what's a door and what's a

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,120
hallway and so forth too and then just

00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:23,580
start to agree that we want to use this

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,169
combined semantic map standard and this

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,779
could be a very valuable thing now of

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,250
course at first only hobbyists are gonna

00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,570
do this you're gonna have to draw your

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,610
own map for your own house this is gonna

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,380
be a pain in the ass but once we start

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,659
understanding how valuable it is to have

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,149
a universal map that's always available

00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:41,309
you will just get it with your house it

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:43,019
will just come with your keys this is

00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,389
the house that comes with it by the way

00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:48,149
and right now what I do is speaking of

00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:49,220
which I every smart device in my house I

00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:52,159
have a gene

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,049
address that is my address and I sign up

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,750
with my gmail address for all of my

00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:59,330
devices so that eventually someday I

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,179
will sell my house I will just give that

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:05,270
Gmail to the person and everything just

00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:07,460
works right right now if I don't do that

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,169
I have to reset everything to factory

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,590
hand them a bunch of manuals and say

00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:15,799
good luck right I mean is absolutely

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:17,299
insane how hard it is to factory reset

00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,559
an entire smart house right now with

00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,049
people again aren't thinking about

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,700
things like that either now the other

00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:25,100
thing is location-based services this is

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,870
Kali early days there's stuff by Wi-Fi

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,940
right now I'm Bluetooth that can start

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:32,870
to do location the next generation of

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,159
Wi-Fi ax I believe has got much it was

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,990
something called round-trip time which

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,059
allows you to get about 1 to 2 meter

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,230
accuracy when they get to the 60

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,490
gigahertz ban they're gonna be able to

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,620
get probably one or two centimeter

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,020
accuracy the idea is that you combine

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,730
this with a semantic map and now you're

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,380
talking right you can take a new device

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,730
and you know exactly where you are in

00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,289
the house you can distinguish between

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,909
which side of the wall that you're on

00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,950
and you can start making some very

00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:56,809
intelligent decisions so again these

00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,270
technologies are coming right all the

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,730
Tinkertoys are all here for us Lego

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,690
bricks the point is they're all here we

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,390
just need to understand that we'd like

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,580
to put them together now if we have all

00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,100
of this it changes entirely how we think

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,110
about the smart toothbrush again like

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,280
the quirky egg miner people love to make

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,960
fun of the smart toothbrush

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,780
and I don't care about what the smart

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,330
toothbrush does but if it adheres to all

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,190
of these rules my smart toothbrush

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,650
becomes a very different thing it

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,480
becomes the thing that Scott is using in

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,210
the bathroom at eight o'clock on a

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,370
Monday morning and in fact what it means

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,100
now is the smart devices independent

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,440
other functionality become context

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,659
indicators so Scott is starting his

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,190
morning and I don't care what the Smart

00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,539
Switch itself is doing no again you

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,190
could argue that there's a motion sensor

00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,900
that could do that as well and that's

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,940
possibly true but what I mean is all

00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,559
devices now become part of a greater

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,440
whole and it becomes much more

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,049
interesting in addition to the specific

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,520
functionality that they have okay so

00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:57,080
we've talked about this direction a

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,929
little bit now let's talk about the

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,160
direct to distributed maligne the issue

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:03,740
here is that

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,690
we are evolving from what I said before

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,820
this direct control we have phones that

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,980
control devices and this is these what

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,870
I'd call the remote control silo model

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,130
and this is what we have to do it's

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,860
understandable but we all know that

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,420
can't scale so you know the next step is

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,400
to have devices talk to each other and

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,200
this is where we get smart routers right

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,840
this is smart things and so forth again

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,150
quite reasonable very good stuff I think

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,770
it's a natural evolution but it's very

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,770
fixed rule-based

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:33,410
and if has anybody ever tried to hold a

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,200
surprise party in a smart house it's

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,910
like shut the damn lights off it's

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,390
impossible right these rule-based

00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:43,940
systems work 90% of the time and the 10%

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:47,150
of the time they fail they are disasters

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,370
and as a UX designer I'm a big believer

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,680
in the fact that human beings are messy

00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,380
and we're not predictable and you just

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,030
can't have an ever extending list of

00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,590
if-then-else statements that will

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,080
capture everything that you're going to

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,370
do and so this idea about having a

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,500
system that is a little bit more

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,150
responsive to say let's take a bunch of

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,160
stuff let's take historical data let's

00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,440
take the sensors and motion sensors and

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,510
then feed it into something that will

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,280
then try to make a more educated

00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,710
decision and like I talked about before

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,450
with the lights where we actually say

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,370
well what's the crazy thing to do and

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,290
what's the easy thing to do and have a

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,150
humility to say you know what I'm not

00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,220
gonna do the full thing today I'm gonna

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,260
do part of it and then let me make the

00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,600
file let me push the final Domino over

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,610
to do the hard stuff this is where we're

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,560
getting a lot more sophisticated because

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,420
we're actually breaking out of it we'll

00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,000
call fixed rule-based systems to

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,920
responsive intelligence and again you

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,300
can imagine dumb versions of it you can

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,130
imagine more sophisticated versions of

00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,580
it but as I gave the example of the

00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,770
lights it's about not trying to automate

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,450
but more meant there's a big difference

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,700
between the two automation tries to

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,800
solve the problem augmentation tries to

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,560
help you solve the problem it's a big

00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,000
difference so what we're seeing today is

00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,790
the fact that we're going to get what

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,250
I'd call rate different buckets of

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,220
intelligence it is a matter of months

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,140
not years before we see a smart vacuum

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,000
cleaner with machine learning on board

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,520
it will completely map out the entire

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,480
area all the specific tiny little things

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,190
all the little nooks and the crannies

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,050
and it will just show you this little

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,790
thing to say oh this is the area and you

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,130
can go well don't go here don't go here

00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,600
and clean really well here and you'll

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,820
just get rid of those invisible walls

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,470
forever and you'll stop doing that kind

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,970
of crazy dance where it just kind of

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,380
randomly goes over where because it

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,880
knows the shape of the room it could

00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,530
actually be very methodical it will

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,240
completely transform how effective these

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,340
vacuums are but it's a completely a

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,230
standalone device so this is the first

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,180
step in machine learning just individual

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,400
devices but then it won't be long before

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:46,250
these devices can talk to other devices

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,830
whether it's motion sensors that's a

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,480
really bad icon that's meant to imply a

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,340
dust sensor by the way there's those

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,890
dots and then of course there's a

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,570
historical data so we can say listen the

00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,180
house is usually empty around 10 o'clock

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,920
I don't sense anybody so this is not a

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,470
special day people people really are

00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,030
gone and by the way the dust sensors are

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,140
telling me it's time to clean so guess

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,430
here I go

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,050
so it's just going to be used a better

00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,149
vacuum cleaner that will run less often

00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,830
and do a better job so this is kind of

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,600
going from a single device to a cluster

00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,950
of devices and then we're gonna get

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,260
effectively what I meant before by

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:21,409
systems of systems so imagine the exact

00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,179
same thing the dust the robots thinks

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,129
it's ready to clean but there's actually

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,350
effectively a nanny-cam that's watching

00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,760
the baby and that's a fact a factory is

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,110
doing things like oh well it's time for

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,060
the baby to sleep I'm gonna close the

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,399
blinds I'm gonna turn off the lights now

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,440
I'll make everything quiet in this room

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,909
and then of course monitor the baby and

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,860
I want to make sure I don't go get too

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:43,220
creepy here but just a generic thing of

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,620
monitoring the room and but the point is

00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,450
it's a separate parallel intelligence

00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,370
doing its own thing but then the vacuum

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,550
kind of goes time to clean and it kind

00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,350
of goes no baby sleeping stop and it

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,820
kinda goes okay and it goes back and

00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,200
it's this idea these intelligences

00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,400
collaboration what does it take for

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,840
these things to kind of work together

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,880
like this I think it's a whole new way

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,230
for us to start to talk a whole new

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,990
level of what smart robbers need to do

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,270
so to me the pain points we have here is

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,640
this idea of the silo trap apps control

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,590
data and so forth and this idea that we

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,420
have today that we see in all of these

00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,300
smart hubs are fixed rule based systems

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,820
fixed rules are fun they make for great

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,990
demos and they really really make your

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,030
spouse angry now the UX goals though are

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,150
about this idea of very tricky

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,790
idea around shared data how can we know

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,840
of course we want a lot of people want

00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,130
things to go to the cloud there's a lot

00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,440
of good things for the cloud but how do

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,320
we think of it almost kind of as a UNIX

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,990
T and then a pipe how can we have like

00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,430
local copies of data that we share but

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,410
then have the stuff that we really want

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,720
go up and then go to the cloud and split

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,250
that up so it's not all or nothing it's

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,290
kind of some of it can be shared some of

00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,670
it can be sent back up again and of

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,840
course the I big thing here is that we

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,000
have to talk about having collaborative

00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,160
intelligences and it's plural so what I

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,470
would argue is that smart places smart

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,320
and more like the IOT is a smart place

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,970
is more like layered like the web we

00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,680
start having these are all the things

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,660
I've talked about and I appreciate this

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,040
is a laundry list I also appreciate like

00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,440
I said before that I'm not here to give

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,000
you specifics but just to say look at

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,190
all the things we've uncovered in this

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,660
brief 30 minutes of talking just say

00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,520
these are the kinds of things that we

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,950
should be doing to make IOT better and

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,570
there are bits and pieces of it but this

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,640
the open source community hasn't really

00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,310
tackled you know many of these and if

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,380
you have this is why I'm here I want to

00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,060
talk about it but the auto configure a

00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,830
network semantics Maps common traits

00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,030
behaviors all this stuff but I would

00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,820
argue is at the bottom to create

00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,410
effectively a smarter network that we

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,540
can do more interesting things with the

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,280
next two creates smarter objects that

00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,810
just self organize and do something with

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
and then finally the last creates

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,290
smarter systems that actually

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,390
collaborate better and more interesting

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,880
ways I would argue this is a very

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:56,180
interesting way a provocative way for us

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,580
to say what should we be working on so

00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,450
my point today is to say these are our

00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,280
new Lego bricks

00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,630
I hope these the Lego bricks that I want

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,970
us to be talking about and building as

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,010
an open-source community and to motivate

00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,750
you a little bit I tried to give you an

00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,630
example of every single one of these

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:13,580
happening today these are happening

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,190
they're being done by certain companies

00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,870
so it's already started we're converting

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,250
from tillers to steering wheels

00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,710
we just need to figure out how to make

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:25,370
sure that we can do this in an open way

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:27,380
so I want to go back to Pablo to say the

00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,000
goal here today was to kind of talk

00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,650
about this in an open way to kind of get

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
us outside of our normal way of thinking

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,430
and to kind of raise a bunch of

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,750
questions I think we as a community are

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,400
the kind of community that can make this

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,420
happen and I'm here to talk to you guys

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
afterwards I'm gonna stick around

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,880
afterwards

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,470
about it and if there are things that

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,270
are happening this place please do let

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,440
me know and let's talk about it

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,080
afterwards to see we can build together

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:53,159
so thank you very much

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,159
