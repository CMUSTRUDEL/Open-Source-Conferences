if you know who I am you might know

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,609
about me through my blog I started a

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,790
blog in 2004 that became very very

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,950
popular so much so popular that it kind

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,200
of started dwarfing my regular work and

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,790
I had this ball of energy I was trying

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,630
to figure out like what do I do with all

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,640
these people that are paying attention

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,900
to my blog I wanted to do something I

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,699
wanted to build something because that's

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,710
what we do we build stuff right so I

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,410
contacted a bunch of people online that

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,720
I respected and one of them was Joel

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,240
Spolsky and he had a really great idea

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,759
there was this site called experts

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,870
exchange with a dash in it and you have

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,149
to be careful how you spell it

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,410
and he said it's a great site but it has

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,790
a terrible experience and I think we

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,640
could build something like that but like

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,100
of the community that did it better for

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,079
developers with developers and so this

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,730
is essentially more or less the design

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,070
document that became Stack Overflow we

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,629
wanted to take concepts from things we

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,399
knew that we're working like wiki's we

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,230
love the wikis could be updated

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,969
I love the ownership of a blog where

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,690
it's like okay I'm the author and I will

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,660
write an article

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,460
I love the uploading mechanics on Digg

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,650
and reddit they got good information to

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,210
the top and then this sort of back and

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,680
forth discussion thing of figuring

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,330
problems out that I would see on forum

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,939
so he's kind of smashed all those

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,549
together into a Frankenstein and we came

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,220
up with Stack Overflow which I'm sure

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,900
you're probably familiar with since I

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,390
left Stack Overflow they they actually

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,710
have a great tutorial that's linked at

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
the top there that sort of explains what

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,330
Stack Overflow is for people that

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,710
haven't seen it before and it walks you

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,479
through and one of the first things it

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,329
says to you if you this is the first

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,950
page of the tutorial is you know this is

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,320
all about getting answers this is about

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,939
QA and it took us a little while to

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,530
figure that out because initially we

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,880
thought okay we're this is a place where

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,740
you kind of discussed programming

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,320
problems but we found that the

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,610
discussions were kind of harming

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,930
beginning of answers people were more

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,579
interested in the discussions and then

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,020
we're actually getting the answers so we

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,450
had to be really strict about that and

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,189
say look no there's a question and then

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,799
you attempt to answer the question if

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,259
you need to clarify the question you can

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,969
but it's really about this QA and it's a

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,439
very developer centric site everything

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,570
about Stack Overflow was built from

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,399
first principles around what I knew

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,649
about developers like sort of how their

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,430
minds work how my mind worked and how

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,409
you get people to be

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,030
you know work together to find an answer

00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,620
so there was this reputation system

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,319
which came from peer acceptance like if

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,000
another programmer saw that you gave a

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,859
good answer that was helpful

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,359
that person would upload it and that

00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:28,900
would contribute to your reputation so

00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:31,000
it's pure acceptance of answers and that

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,409
is a number that's next to your name

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,989
that represents sort of your pure

00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,239
acceptance of the answers that you give

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,590
it on the site we also have a badging

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,510
system in addition to the reputation

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,480
system there's a badge system to me this

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,430
is like how you learn software rather

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,379
than give people a manual you sort of

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,019
present a menu of like things you could

00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,760
try to learn and you get badges and it's

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,260
very much similar to Boy Scout and Girl

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,150
Scout badges I was like oh cool here's

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,709
some things that I'm interested in that

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,450
I've tried on the site and I get these

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,430
badges as a result of you know

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,209
experimenting and trying things on the

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,950
site and it's also the entire structure

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,569
of Stack Overflow is about highlighting

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,310
sort of your best work and putting your

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,810
best foot forward so if you go to your

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,639
profile page on Stack Overflow you'll

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,230
notice that there's some ambient sorting

00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,939
that goes on here about oh these are my

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,349
answers they got the most up votes that

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:18,879
we're the most helpful to other people

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,290
in the world you know here's the

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,909
questions that were the most helpful and

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,010
sort of where your reputation is coming

00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,419
from what tags you participate in it's

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,519
all about how you're contributing back

00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,620
and helping other people learn and

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,449
helping yourself learn along the way and

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,919
this actually extends across the entire

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,319
network Stack Overflow is a network of

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,479
sites it was working so well that we

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,310
said wow this this this mousetrap that

00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,109
we've built is very effective so let's

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,819
try it with some other topics and we

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,859
kind of extended the engine outward to

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,209
see where it could go as a QA engine and

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:50,049
that's where you're seeing accounts

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,419
there so what we ended up building was

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,669
kind of a very very complicated game

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,799
that was designed to get a very specific

00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,689
result you know really good questions

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,699
and really good answers and it's kind of

00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:03,220
a strict system but these kind of games

00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,349
are very familiar to developers we work

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,930
with you know this state machine the

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,400
computer that's constantly you know

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,840
iterating through its set of rules and

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,400
reaching decisions that can sometimes be

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,829
very arbitrary but this is very native

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,590
to us as developers like we expect this

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,570
kind of environment a machine that given

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,279
a set of rules produces a set of output

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,320
so Stack Overflow kind of reflects that

00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,310
design right it's it's also a system of

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,050
rules

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,030
like a program that's designed to get

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,099
behavior from people right so

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,949
essentially you're programming the

00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,749
people at that point it's kind of a meta

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,300
programming but I'm very comfortable

00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:39,249
with this because I when I started as a

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,409
programmer I started by typing in these

00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,939
games from these books read basic right

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,289
so you would type in the game which was

00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,900
excruciating of course you had to type

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:48,099
in every character and then you would

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,050
play the game and then you realize hey I

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,699
can change the game right like I typed

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,650
it in and now I have a game whatever it

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,479
is like these old classic games like

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,710
hunt the Wampus and you can change the

00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,629
game you can make it do whatever you

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,490
want it to do right which is I mean

00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,529
that's super fun right you're in control

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,240
and you know here's an 8-bit

00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:06,699
representation of hunt the Wumpus it's

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,750
these directed graphs and doesn't

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,550
actually sound that fun and probably

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,370
isn't that fun in retrospect but at the

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,810
time it seemed really cool and you know

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,060
this extends now with stuff like

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,830
Minecraft which I still think it's very

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,339
funny that this ended up with Microsoft

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,050
because it's Java right but it's cool

00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,360
because it's kids learning to program

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,669
really it is this is probably the most

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,319
powerful tool we have for teaching kids

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:30,310
how to program is basically Minecraft

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,050
because they want to do stuff in the

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,300
game it's like wow I can change the game

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,349
I can make the game do what I want it to

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,639
do right so that's exciting and I think

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,839
that's the reflection of what we're

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,089
trying to stack overflows create this

00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,460
kind of collaborative game where we're

00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:48,069
learning stuff together and games the

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,120
best games are really about learning and

00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:51,399
the game is just there to give you a

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,919
structure so you work towards you know

00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,779
collaborative goals that make sense and

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,770
that's supposed to be fun right like

00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,539
that's what we're supposed to be doing

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,509
they're supposed to be having fun so it

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,120
puts the emphasis on that now Stack

00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,800
Overflow as a game was also turned out

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,490
to be addictive which wasn't really the

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,479
intent so we had to put in some systems

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,669
there's this thing called the daily

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,259
reputation cap which means you can only

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,120
get a certain amount of reputation per

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,759
day and then it's like okay we'll just

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,349
go you know do something else do actual

00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,349
work and then come back to Stack

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,180
Overflow tomorrow right so you have to

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,789
be careful these games can have dark

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,729
sides like you know if you don't think

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:32,589
through what you're doing but that was

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,349
really much the structure so that was my

00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:35,940
life from we started that in 2008 and I

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,020
was there and

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,940
2012 and it again it's it's very very

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,170
structured it's a very strict system

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,340
which we get a lot of pushback on

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,750
because people come to Stack Overflow

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,730
and like well I just want to type words

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,290
into a box we're like well that's not

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,600
really we do it Stack Overflow right

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,370
there's a purpose to what you're doing

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,800
here you're trying to accomplish

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,390
something you know you're trying to move

00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,340
software development forward in the way

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,750
you do that is by producing a good repro

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,180
of whatever problem it is you're having

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,190
or explain the problem to us in a way

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,930
that we can understand and get excited

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,490
about your problem right it's a really

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,920
interesting problem that we would love

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,560
to help you solve and that's how you

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,850
learn you learn by teaching right you're

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,820
teaching some of the time and you're

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,960
learning some of the other time and

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,130
because this is the all things open

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,470
conference I do want to note that from

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,510
the very beginning all the information

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,060
that's in Stack Overflow is Creative

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,280
Commons so you can actually download the

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,390
entire corpus of not just Stack Overflow

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,670
but actually all the Stack Exchange

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,960
sites if you want to do data analysis or

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,310
just want to have the data or you want

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,780
you think it's cool to have a copy of

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,510
Stack Overflow on your laptop I don't

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,060
know you can do this

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,090
so it's at archive.org which is you know

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,090
a great resource and but its neck

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,040
overflow itself is not open source so at

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,930
this point in my life some stuff started

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,810
happening to me so as I was developing

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,490
Stack Overflow I was like what do I do

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,100
what's my job what what what am I doing

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,070
with my life right and I realized like I

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,169
build massively multiplayer games for

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,640
you basically right that and we do it

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,750
together I don't mean like I dictate the

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,280
rules like we do it together we're

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,490
building this game that we're playing

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,700
together and then so in 2009 this

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,100
happened to me and then in 2012 this

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,240
happened to me and you kind of don't

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,020
want this to happen to you just for the

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,660
record

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,849
two babies is a lot of babies that's a

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,090
lot of babies right there very sweet

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,379
girl Spray squeals so at this point in

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,629
my life I'm getting like a crash course

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,430
and in like empathy not that I wasn't

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:34,510
necessarily empathetic before but you

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,800
know I love the computer and the

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,630
computer is just a machine you tell it

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,159
what to do it does exactly what you told

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,649
to do even if you didn't actually want

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,360
it to do that thing and it just marches

00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,540
forward mindlessly on it's a little task

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,700
right but kids don't work that way right

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,750
so I had to learn a lot about sort of

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,279
human beings at this point and this book

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,170
how to talk how to talk so kids will

00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,700
listen it's such a fantastic book if

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,110
you're ever a parent or just wanna

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,050
interact with humans better this is such

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,670
an amazing amazing book because what

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,770
they don't tell you about having kids is

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,610
like your kids are gonna be freaking out

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,520
like a lot of the time and like I was

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,890
not ready I was not ready for this level

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,649
of freaked out in my life man you know

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,810
so that's something I had to learn about

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,980
so this is a blog entry that someone

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,120
wrote and he actually wrote a book it's

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,820
really really funny but this is

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,220
unbelievably true before I left on this

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,890
trip I have an 8 8 my son is 8 years old

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,000
and my daughters are 5 years old I was

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,440
taking shower cuz I'm hurrying ahead

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,420
take an overnight flight to get here and

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm in the shower and and my son's

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,529
crying outside the door outside the

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,149
shower as I'm showering like Harry what

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,520
is wrong like right take a shower I got

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,089
to go he's like my cheeseburger had

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:50,950
ketchup on it and oh it was just he he

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:52,510
couldn't so here I am like add a good

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,190
dad like I'm wiping the ketchup off his

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,660
hamburger like I'm digging the ketchup

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,880
out of the bun like here you go Henry

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,440
I'll fix it for you right so this is

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,910
kind of your life and the thing that's

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,290
weird about this and this is so

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,450
important in song if you get one thing

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,430
on this talk it's like not everything is

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,779
a problem to be fixed because when

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,790
you're an engineer when you're a

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,500
software developer your idea is like we

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,360
fix problems right we got the world's

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,540
like oh look a problem I shall solve

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,630
that problem right well kids do not work

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,029
that way right like solving the problem

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,720
doesn't actually work which is so

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:28,029
counterintuitive to me as a person like

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,440
when when like say we're out of cereal

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,240
it's like well we're out of cereal you

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,290
know like that's just the answer like

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,160
well I don't and we're out of cereal

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,389
it's like they don't really want

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,100
to hear that what they want to hear is

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,350
that I'm really sorry we're out of

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,019
cereal I wish we had that cereal if I

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,420
had a magical cart I would fly and get

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,680
you that cereal right it's not really

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,209
about fixing the problem it's about

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,350
empathy there's a really cool video I

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,089
can't show it to you because I have time

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,160
it's called it's not about the nail it's

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,930
hilarious it kind of illustrates that

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,310
this this is a problem for adults as

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,779
well that this idea that you know you're

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,550
not everything is a problem to be solved

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,110
another thing can be solved there's a

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,920
lot of social problems that I can't

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,329
solve I don't know how to solve so that

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,699
was kind of a challenge for me but it

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,860
led directly into my next project where

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,540
I like video games and I like playing

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,730
video games but I noticed I had been on

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,100
this forum for a long time and I noticed

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,100
gosh it's actually more fun to be on the

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,319
forum than play the games longer term I

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,439
was like well that's weird right so the

00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:29,079
forum game was actually more reliable

00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:31,089
fun for me than the actual video games

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,800
right that kind of comment came and went

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,589
but when I was on the forum I was like

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,410
gosh this is a great game right which

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,000
leads me to discourse so discourse is an

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,560
open source project it's open source

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,060
discussion software and when I initially

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,800
started I was like oh it's kind of be

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,420
like you know we had this great word

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,069
discourse I was able to get the domain

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,899
name for and register and it does

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,759
represent what we're trying to do but

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,490
it's also kind of fancy it's like oh is

00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,699
this debate club and quickly on I

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,069
realized that you know fun is kind of an

00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:08,050
essential ingredient to discussion

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:11,949
systems now on stackoverflow we tolerate

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,720
fun but you know it's not really about

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,120
that it's about like getting stuff done

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,259
right it's not wrong to have fun but

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,240
that's not the purpose of what we're

00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:21,970
doing there whereas discussions really

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,759
are overtly about am i enjoying this am

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,050
I having a good time you know and it

00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,290
could be you know a dinner party it

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,699
could be more overtly a party and I had

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,290
actually written a blog entry about this

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,759
I had to like go on record saying well

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,620
if there's too many fun questions you

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,660
guys need to chill out with the fun

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,879
questions because they're kind of not

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,579
working in our system because other

00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,130
developers didn't like it when you got

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,360
reputation for posting a joke and this

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,870
actually makes sense if you think about

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,720
it

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,890
as a joke you know unless you wrote the

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,360
joke and you're the author joke it's

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,770
someone else's work right it's not

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,240
really in your work and it's just

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,029
because it's funny it's not you know

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,290
about a problem that was solved so we

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,980
had to map through all that with Stack

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:05,050
Overflow and when I came back to

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,900
discourse it was interesting to sort of

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,089
embrace that fun aspect of the site and

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,980
say yeah we're actually here to have a

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:16,960
good time we're not actually necessarily

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:19,540
here to do a ton of work so where we see

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,610
this this is a discourse community and

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,350
you notice there's a games category like

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,140
when they launched the site this is our

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,730
first beta site one of the categories

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,850
was games and they started playing these

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,279
really complicated forum games all by

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,110
themselves like they sort of adapted to

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,610
this new reality and we're saying hey

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,240
yeah we are here to have fun let's have

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,650
fun with each other but it's not all fun

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,270
I do want to emphasize like one of the

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,680
things I love about discourse and one

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,040
things I love about online discussion is

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,990
that you're sort of synthesizing a story

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,480
that explains what's happening to you

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,339
which on some level is unexplainable a

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,510
lot of stuff that happens in life we

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,250
don't know what happens we don't know

00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,470
how it happens and it can be very

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,700
frustrating so this book 59 seconds also

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,570
another excellent book I highly

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,459
recommend it to really anyone they were

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,570
trying to do some research to figure out

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,130
like how do you deal with negative

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,290
experiences like what's a good way to

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,940
handle a negative x negative experience

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,070
should you talk about it should you

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,950
write about it and they did a little bit

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,990
of research and they had two groups and

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,670
one group wrote about it and one group

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,589
sort of just talked to people about it

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,910
and the group that wrote about their

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,920
negative experience had a much better

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,600
outcome they felt better about this

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,860
thing that had happened to them and they

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,950
felt like they had worked through it

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,350
because when you write it down you're

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,029
creating a narrative around this thing

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,589
that happened to you and that narrative

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,480
becomes part of your story you

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,670
contextualise what's happening to you

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,040
and you actually are able to explain it

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,560
and rationalize it in a way that makes

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,180
sense right you told a story right which

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,890
is one of the most timeless things we

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,110
can do as human beings like just tell me

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,060
a story right and it has to be your

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,010
story don't tell me someone else's story

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,790
don't tell me a movie you saw tell me

00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,320
about you

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,110
tell me about stuff that have

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,080
to you because that's real that's what

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,790
we're here for so another interesting

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,530
thing that happened to us we had an

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,510
early customer that was their site which

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,090
is exploding like it was unbelievably

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,800
popular the point we had to like charge

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,420
the more money basically and talk to him

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,410
about like moving up to bigger tiers and

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,090
all that good stuff I was like what are

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,590
these people even do this I I went to

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,830
their site and I looked at it and I

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,900
realized what they do is interactive

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,180
fiction so like they're in the business

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,100
of storytelling like literally right so

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,140
no wonder they love to discourse because

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,910
that's they already got it right they

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,680
sell these stories where you make

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,240
multiple choices and then you go through

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,280
the narrative and it's very much like

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,590
one of my you know favorite things that

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,970
choose your own adventure books which to

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,360
me these are early programmer books

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,560
right making choices doing jumps going

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,740
back to see what other choices you could

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,330
have made so open source so stack

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,130
overflow as I mentioned was not open

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,440
source and one of the reasons it

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,830
couldn't be open source is because stack

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,080
is a very strict tool it's a very it's

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,580
designed for when we launched it it said

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,860
like professional developers or

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,480
enthusiasts right we did not say bring

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,890
us you know people who don't know how to

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,780
program and we will teach them how to

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,130
program that was never the intent of

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,170
Stack Overflow is about people who knew

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,900
how to program but wanted to get better

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,160
at it right so it was about improving or

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,480
like you know sharpening your skills

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,340
right and it's also you know very

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,160
targeted and what it does so when we

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,660
gave people Stack they would actually

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,610
hurt themselves with it like if you gave

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,900
a kid a scalpel right this is kind of a

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,910
dangerous thing to do because it's a

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,640
tool for surgeons it's a tool for people

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,890
who need to cut very precisely so that

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,170
was frustrating to me so when when we

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,790
built discourse I wanted to build it in

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,980
such a way that I could give it to you

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,570
and you would not hurt yourself any

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,310
particular situation where you're like

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,410
hey I need a community I need people to

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,030
work together discourse is an

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,070
appropriate solution in a way that Stack

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,570
Overflow is not at all because there's

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,760
first of all there's down voting and

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,290
Stack Overflow you know like you can

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,020
actually say that that doesn't work for

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,000
me and I don't like that solution and

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,730
people don't like that right it's not a

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,560
great feeling to be down voted but it's

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,419
there for a reason so in discourse

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,449
there's no concept

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,459
down voting so I can give it to you as a

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,779
general building block of community and

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,220
you're not going to hurt yourself you're

00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,589
gonna have a good experience and you can

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,209
use a table knife to like open a box you

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,909
could use a table knife too you know of

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,409
course cut your food there's a lot of

00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,739
different scenarios where it's useful

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:36,659
and it is of course completely open

00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:39,419
source I feel that communities have to

00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:41,340
be open source because when you build a

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,889
community it's a trust relationship

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,629
right like I can't take this software

00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:47,580
away from you if you go and build a

00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:49,799
community on discourse and it becomes

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,559
very popular I can't then say oh now you

00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,629
owe s five thousand dollars a month or

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,429
you know goodbye to your community

00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:58,109
I think this trust relationship is so

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:02,249
essential to building community that

00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:04,320
when I when I started discourse the only

00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,850
option was open source that's the only

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,559
way that I think you can build

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,499
sustainable community is on a platform

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,419
that you own together right like we

00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,279
build this course we have 20 people at

00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,230
discourse now but you can help us build

00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,850
this course you can suggest things for

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,950
this course you can build plug-ins for

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,200
discourse all this stuff our spirit

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,029
animal was WordPress like I really liked

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,980
what WordPress did and I wanted to

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:28,230
emulate it some degree so github.com

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,590
slash discourse the complete project and

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,570
pretty much all the plugins are there so

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,629
comparing these two things so in stack

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,109
overflow is about being civil it was

00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:42,419
about useful information and practical

00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:45,149
problems that you actually face as sort

00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,460
of a developer in your daily life and of

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:49,289
course the data was Creative Commons so

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,749
discourse on the other hand it's about

00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,340
empathy it's about listening to other

00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:55,379
people and just sort of hearing their

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,139
experience and feeling their experience

00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:59,489
and sharing those stories you know and

00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,289
hearing this story of what's happening

00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:05,129
to these people and it is completely

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:06,480
fully open source so then the final

00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,549
question I got to was like okay I

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,299
realized in 2012 I build massively

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:14,940
multiplayer games for developers but I

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:18,570
was like is that all I do so recently I

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,739
was approached by the publishers of DK

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,330
I've actually bought some of these books

00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:23,460
for my kids and they said hey we want

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,039
you to do a little interview for kids

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,380
about programming and I was like okay

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,480
cool

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,070
I recognized the series I'll do that and

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,690
I did this and then I completely forgot

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,700
about it for months you know cuz book

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,530
publishing takes a while it's a great

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,120
book actually came out really nice so

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,250
then I went back when I got the printed

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,540
copy finally and I read my interview I

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,590
was like what did I even say to these

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,000
questions I don't remember you knows

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,250
it's an interview for kids I didn't

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,890
spend a ton of time on it and I realized

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,510
I had actually encapsulated the thing

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,300
that was most important to me in this

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,100
interview was that the reason we build

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,180
software right like why do we build

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,400
software you know is it because

00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,630
algorithmic purity is about you know the

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,490
feeling of building things and I

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,730
realized no to me software's about

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,460
building things that helps people be

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,350
better versions of themselves and I'm

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,650
starting with me right like I want to be

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,840
a better version of me so that's what we

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,250
do and that's what I hope you guys can

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,380
take away from this is like we build

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,920
open source software that encourages us

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,090
to be our better selves and that's the

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,790
point of this course that's the point of

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,890
Stack Overflow and all the things that

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,150
I've worked on so that's all I have for

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,150
