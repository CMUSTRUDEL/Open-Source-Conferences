okay so I've been thinking for the last

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,660
few years about sustainability of this

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,330
thing that we spent 20 years building

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,230
first of all nobody said it yet but

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,150
we're right right almost on the 20th

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,520
anniversary of the coining of the term

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,820
open source' everybody knows that it

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,890
sits in February but I believe at this

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,250
event will be the first sort of party

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,599
about that so and I'll have more about

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,640
that in my talk but I just want to be

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,140
sure you guys know it's been 20 years

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
some of us have been here that long

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,329
you've been hearing all morning about

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,860
people's resumes I have been here that

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,840
long as well I've been spending the last

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,760
five years going okay great we did

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,340
really well now how do we make sure it

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,570
doesn't all fall apart and I spend a lot

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,210
of time thinking about that

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,829
so that's none of what this is about the

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,629
way that I work in open source is

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,039
looking for problems and then trying to

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,989
figure out how to be part of the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,359
solution and that's what this is amusing

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,059
on so first of all I want to say that

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,000
people are amazing people are amazing

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,670
and open-source is amazing because of

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
the people it's you guys it's it's

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,290
everybody that's ever given a patch

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,479
right and you have to remember that

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,650
about open-source it's it's it's nice

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,299
that there are companies that are

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,610
appealing that's a good thing it's a

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,860
good engine but fundamentally this

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,990
started out being about people who were

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,509
really tired of the way that the

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,100
software industry was working right we

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,500
were tired of it we were tired of crap

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,479
software going out there and and not

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
being able to fix it knowing that we

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,869
knew how and not having access to the

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,180
source code because somebody wanted to

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,990
maximize profit and decided to hide the

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,360
code right that's why we did it so we

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,700
need to remember that hold on to that

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,500
memory because I am convinced that this

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,399
whole beautiful flowering will stop

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,170
happening if we forget this okay so I

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,049
remember what it was like working before

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,579
I worked for years at Apple before open

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,619
source became a thing

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,780
free software was already happening but

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,600
you know free as in you can't make the

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,459
living was a little troubling to me and

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
then I got involved in a project where I

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,970
couldn't my engineers couldn't see the

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,530
code that they were working

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,840
because of an internal struggle that was

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,670
happening inside of Apple oh my goodness

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,470
is that inefficient when your engineers

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,300
are black boxing code that they wrote

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,660
but they haven't seen recent changes on

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,130
and and I I said some things you've got

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,900
a change right now

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,580
let me establish that I believe that the

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,310
act of writing software is actually

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,180
closer to being an artist than it is to

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,220
being say a cog in a corporate wheel and

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,410
when you spent a lot of time building

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,790
something that you think is beautiful

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,860
that your friends think is beautiful and

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,110
the marketers and and legal people take

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,210
it and do things with it that you didn't

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,610
like you know that can be really

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,130
disheartening for the gentle spirits

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,720
that create this stuff and I saw that

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,090
happening in the bad old days as well

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,940
and a lot of this is what the

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,710
motivations for open-source was so we

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,620
used to explain open source to people I

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,420
spent 10 years replying around the world

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,510
explaining it to governments and and

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,900
this is what we got a lot like I don't

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,820
see how the economics of this works so

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,739
why would I believe in this you know and

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,080
it was really interesting because it was

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,180
by country like some countries were like

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,100
yeah this sounds really good you know in

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,540
other countries were like no I don't get

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,770
it like Switzerland it just went right

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,410
over their heads because they couldn't

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,239
follow a money trail that made sense and

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,550
it having them understand that it was

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,760
about more than that was really really

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:40,570
really hard so the good news is now that

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,580
open source has sort of won you know

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,010
people now all believe that it's

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,390
possible inner source has been happening

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,519
for a long time but you used to not

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,700
hardly hear about it because there

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,080
weren't companies that were prepared to

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,450
believe that open source was gonna win

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,220
now all of a sudden open sources

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,660
everybody knows that's the software that

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,310
you want and so how do I make that

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:05,739
happen in my company right whoops so I

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,850
think that open source is actually about

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:12,430
enlightened self-interest at every stage

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,890
so originally we had hobbyists they had

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,150
day jobs they worked at night on open

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,150
source because it was more interesting

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,739
than their day job now we have people

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,090
who want to get their resume out there

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,770
because they're hoping to get hired by a

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,360
different company or they want to show

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,620
off their stuff they want to jump they

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
want a job hop and get a

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,210
our job and having open source code out

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,760
there as a resume is a really useful

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,110
tool right but just remember there's

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,250
nothing wrong with enlightened

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,540
self-interest as long as it's

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,460
enlightened self-interest okay this guy

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,560
when I worked for Intel they didn't yet

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,750
think that canonical was a real distro I

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,460
was trying to get them to pick up

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,870
canonical and support it and maybe drop

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,720
a couple of the older ones that they

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,150
were holding on to and understand being

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,729
supported by Intel as a distro means

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,680
that you get all the chipsets to test

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,960
stuff on you get you know it's more

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,910
possible that you're gonna work well so

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,280
it's a good thing to be in that team

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,039
they were very curious about Marc's

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,770
motivations like okay the guy's been to

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,389
space he's got billions of dollars why

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,280
is he doing this thing for free like

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,780
what what is it why is he doing this oh

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,190
and he lives in the Isle of Man does

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,320
that mean he's money laundering through

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,479
this company great they really actually

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,979
wondered that and so I spent a fair

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,590
amount of time talking to him about his

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,990
motivations and it turns out the most

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,870
fun he ever had in his at that point

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,970
short life was coding and he just wanted

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,070
to get back to it but he also wanted to

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,810
give something back he felt gratitude

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,550
for the life he'd been given and he

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,039
wanted to give something back that was

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,570
his whole motivation and they didn't

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,139
believe it for a long time but we

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,150
finally eventually got there right so

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,880
when you when you hear people talk about

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,729
the money flow you lose this piece right

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,530
we used to talk a lot about gift culture

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,570
in the beginnings of open source we

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,970
commissioned a lot of research about why

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,550
people do it and remember this was back

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,050
when most people were not employed to do

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,970
open source these days most people that

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,610
do open source are employed to do it and

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,650
that's a good thing right but back when

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,650
it was a gift culture we talked about

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,470
the difference between an impelled code

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,440
give like like copyleft licensing you

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,810
must give up your changes versus a gift

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,460
of code like from a permissive license

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,710
like apache where you're not required to

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,190
but it makes your life easier if you

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,630
give up stream stuff back and and it

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,820
also makes everybody's world a little

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,099
bit better we talked about this a lot

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,260
and I think that we barely talk about it

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,330
now and that's really unfortunate

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,710
this was happening at the same time I

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,410
couldn't tell if you were gonna be able

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,710
to read that one figuring out that what

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:50,290
Right Livelihood looks like right when I

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,240
pick a company I try to do it based on

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,880
Right Livelihood not who's gonna

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,340
optimize how much money I make but am I

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,770
gonna feel good about this I have left

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,050
companies based on ethical concerns and

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,210
I've never been sorry about that

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,430
and I think that's also an open-source

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:11,830
ethic and as that gets diluted by the

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,230
influx of money I think we have problems

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,510
so we have to watch for that remember

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,760
you have a moral compass this is about

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,100
gift this is about generosity and giving

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,170
back for what you have and it's not

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,220
about how much you can get it's about

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:28,420
how much you can give so you know you're

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,370
not gonna be surprised to hear that I

00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,770
spend a lot of time in India and I

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,680
believe in saver saver is being of

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,830
service how can I be of service to this

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,300
community that has done so much and I

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,030
have some ideas about ways that you can

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,710
do that okay for me I got into it

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,810
because I wanted to be the change that I

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,180
wanted to see in the world I thought

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,120
that software engineering for pure

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,310
profit was pretty corrupted because they

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,680
had left out you know what about the

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,400
users oh well we'll just get them to

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,440
upgrade caching right that doesn't sound

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,530
right to me if they paid for it once

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,090
right if you see a defect in software

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,500
and you know you could fix it if you had

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,850
the code but you can't have the code

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
because that's gonna screw it with some

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,770
of these profit that doesn't sound right

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,590
to me that's why I got into it people

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,270
have different motivations right it

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,540
occurs to me that we did not do a good

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,180
job as a movement of documenting the

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,430
lessons that we learned along the way to

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,410
get to the place that we're at today and

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,360
so when I meet people that are just

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,099
coming to open-source a lot of times I

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,099
hear things that sound really dangerous

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:39,040
to me like how do we keep the VC's

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,540
interested like I promise you if you

00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,919
write interesting software the VCS will

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,990
figure out how to be interested you

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,150
don't need to pander to them not at all

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,790
take their advice maybe listen to them a

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,320
little bit but do not cross your moral

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,460
compass because it's going to make the

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,410
VC happy

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,170
right anyway I'm in the process of

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,810
working on a book that will be released

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,390
for Auslan in July next year

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,550
it's another iteration of open sources

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,100
open sources 3 this time because we do

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,140
one every 10 years apparently and this

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,270
one is meant to be an encapsulation of

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,230
the stories that are important like the

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,690
story about mark

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,590
like the story about you know anybody

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,090
coming into the project so I think it

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,800
would be good for you to think about

00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,510
stuff you've learned from your

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,370
involvement in open source projects and

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,160
maybe you have a story that people need

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,260
to hear in order to hold open source and

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,270
go forward with it properly and if you

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,740
feel like maybe that's the case then I

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,300
would love to talk to you about that

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,340
we're gonna be around for a couple of

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,200
days doing that but I hear some quick

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,870
ideas of things that anybody can do

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,650
anybody in this audience can do to give

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,650
back first of all mentor my god open

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:51,010
source skills are still really rare in

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,990
the larger scheme of things and that's

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,420
not good we need more people to know how

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,860
to do open source so mentor and

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,080
especially mentor underrepresented

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,980
people there aren't enough girls in this

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,140
room right or people of color serve on a

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,870
board this is the OSI Board last year

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,060
almost every big project has a board

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,530
behind it serve on it try to figure out

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,420
how to do that I've done a lot of this

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:17,860
it is really really enlightening and

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:20,560
worth doing this one is about that this

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,120
is a movie that we we do a movie at

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
pretty much every conference that we go

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,720
to and in order to get a ticket to the

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,450
movie you have to give to a non-profit

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,640
that's showing at the show so we try to

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,110
find ways to push people in the

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,420
direction that they ought to be going

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,160
anyway by giving the you know dangling a

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,050
prize I'm not saying this is the only

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,180
way to do that but think about ways to

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,400
hack the system so that people you know

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,310
behave better do their to their highest

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,680
cells and then hack your company if you

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,750
can I promise you that son had no

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,970
interest in doing OpenOffice for the

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,840
reasons I wanted to do it they wanted to

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,480
do it because it was gonna hurt

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,250
Microsoft I wanted to do it because

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,500
Microsoft only supported 13 languages

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,970
worldwide and I thought that was not

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,410
good for people that were trying to

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,060
learn how to do computing to have to

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,720
also learn another language human

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,090
language

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,650
and and this was an opportunity to make

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,480
the digital divide a little bit smaller

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,550
son didn't care about any of that they

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,380
just wanted to hurt Microsoft figure out

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,660
how to hack your company so that good

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,930
matches the greed that your company you

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,390
know encompasses and then try to hold

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,400
love in all of this I know it sounds

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,400
trite and then you know I'm obviously a

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:32,920
hippie so I'm gonna say that but try to

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,690
remember why it started okay this is

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,340
this is the other reason that I wanted

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,610
to get into it because I believe this

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,700
guy not everything he said but I was in

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,590
the Peace Corps right I wanted to be the

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,900
change that I wanted to see you guys can

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,750
all do this too and do well I promise

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,700
you and I know people are really younger

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,550
people now are really impatient to hurry

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,680
up and make money it will come if you do

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,370
the things that you love and you hold on

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,700
to your ideals

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,200
it really will so I'm gonna suggest that

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,760
you find the open source initiative

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,800
people at some point during this show

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,810
because I believe they have a time line

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,660
that you can place yourself on as a

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,180
first step towards creating a better

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,850
history of open source to help give

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,920
people guideposts about where to go in

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,990
the open source world next and how to

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,280
not give up the game and that's mostly

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,770
what I wanted to talk about thank you

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,770
