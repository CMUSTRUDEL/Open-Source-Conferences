00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,859
you haven't had a chance to stop by the

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,970
up with summer stock com booth I think

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,859
we've got a little bit of swag laughs

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,590
there's like 3,000 of you taken

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,730
everything which is awesome but if you

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,230
want to contribute I think the biggest

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,329
thing that I hear all the time is that

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,850
oh I don't have a story to tell or I'm

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,219
not a good writer but everyone has a

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,110
great story and and we have a great

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,280
platform for you to share your story so

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,829
these are ways that you can connect to

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,610
us the first link there is just a web

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,500
form to help start getting your thoughts

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,270
together you can email us at open at

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,969
open source comm and we're hanging out

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,920
on freenode IRC there's a few reasons

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,090
why people contribute we tried to make

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,049
up some stuff and then we figured we

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,549
should just ask people why they

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,470
contribute so here's a couple of them

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,790
whether you're growing your network if

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,280
you're trying to put some extra

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,200
spotlight on your place or project and

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,210
the best thing is you get free editorial

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,850
services so we've got a small team that

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,500
can help you if your words aren't that

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,369
great can help make them better and we

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,350
get a lot of feedback on that I wanted

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,360
to give a quick shout out we have a easy

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,369
contest we have a contest going on right

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,950

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,869
swag kit with the Raspberry Pi if you go

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,280

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,220
