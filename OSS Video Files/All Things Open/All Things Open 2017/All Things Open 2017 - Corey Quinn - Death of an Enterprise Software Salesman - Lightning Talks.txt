thank you all for inviting me to your

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,990
board meeting here today although upon

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,090
later reflection none of you will

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,700
remember actually having extended an

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,900
invitation don't worry I won't be

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,940
stopping to take questions you probably

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,160
have seen my company scattered around in

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,359
airports around the world advertising

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,060
with statements that make no sense

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,980
that's fine no one is buying anything

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,380
from a billboard it builds brand

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,910
recognition so when I identify myself as

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,489
being with a company here in this

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,890
conversation you smile and nod rather

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,530
than asking who the hell we are this is

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,719
the plan let me throw up a diagram of

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,030
how my system works if you don't

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,620
understand it I'm not going to explain

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,210
it to you and will instead imply that

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,079
you're the idiot

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,890
I will not expand my acronyms I will not

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,090
talk about how any of it works and

00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:00,449
frankly that's why we have

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,949
enterprise-grade slides I'm not here to

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,420
give you a ten thousand foot view I'm

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,589
not here to give you a sixty thousand

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,110
foot view I'm here to give you an

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,119
orbital view take a look at the broader

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,979
strategic landscape of your problems and

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,869
how I can potentially solve them for you

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:18,720
that's why I'm here that's why I dress

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,850
like this you may or may not agree with

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,369
what I'm selling but that's okay later

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,259
I will take the man or woman out to play

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,170
golf and make the actual who makes a

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,689
decision and then sell them that was a

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,460
joke this is a fortune 500 company board

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,009
meeting of course the decision makers a

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:42,509
man why would we value diversity in this

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:45,869
console now my system is probably not

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,710
going to solve your actual problem you

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,869
will be amazed astounded and grateful by

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,950
how little that actually matters to

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,360
anything

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,369
because when the finger of blame comes

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,130
to point at people it's not going to be

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,170
landing on you realistically it's not

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,600
landing on me either because you're

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:10,369
doing all the right things by going with

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:15,260
my company we're in the good part of the

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:19,580
Gartner Magic Quadrant this is why we

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,260
advertise it in flight magazines this is

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,330
a way to outsource decision-making

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,280
around things that used to be hard and

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,790
confusing this is why we write large

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,590
checks to Gartner what's your

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,239
alternative to hire some unwashed

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,940
open-source hippie who can solve your

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,760
problem technically in 20 minutes or a

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,980
team of well-dressed MBA graduates who

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,860
we can work 120 hours a week bill you

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,500
for 40 hours and they are wizards with

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,940
Excel it's really up to you but which is

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,470
the more defensible if it doesn't work

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,239
what those open-source hippies fail to

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,069
grasp is that the reason that this sale

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,870
is going to work isn't just my clever

00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,970
airport advertisements but it's because

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,430
of personal relationships we're all

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,650
friends on a board level that is how it

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,720
works in the halls of power this is how

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,910
decisions get made at enterprise scale

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,819
one group of people understand that the

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:17,450
other one doesn't

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:19,639
food for thought now yes there is an

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,620
ideological argument to be made here and

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,239
that's terrific but I'm here to sell

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,519
software and you're here to do whatever

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,109
the hell it is your company does and I

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,389
don't think that either of us is in the

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,709
business of saving the whales if you

00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,780
want to do that terrific

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,870
go work for Greenpeace they're not on my

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,670
client list the point here is that

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,440
making a sale today is good for my

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,260
company and it's good for your company

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,859
we all come out of this looking good as

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,859
a direct result of this the time is now

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,690
there has never been a better time to

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,070
partner one large enterprise company to

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,090
one large enterprise service provider

00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,930
unfortunately I will not be staying to

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,580
take questions

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,080
I found another prospect that

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,660
desperately needs the thing that my

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,690
company provides but that's okay I will

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,370
remember you fondly in fact I'll name my

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,920
yacht after you when I get home at the

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,320
end of the day out of respect for your

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,290
business and is a constant pernicious

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,070
reminder to myself that as board members

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:23,700
at a company like this you are all

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,700
c-level executives

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,119
