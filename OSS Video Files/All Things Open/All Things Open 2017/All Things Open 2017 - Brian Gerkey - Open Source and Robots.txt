good afternoon thank you for coming I'm

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,000
Brian gurkey I'm CEO of open robotics

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,580
we're located out in the Bay Area and we

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,080
make open source software for robots and

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,460
so what I'm gonna tell you about today

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,590
is sort of how we got here kind of the

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,480
the origin story for the project I'm

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,619
guessing most of you although hopefully

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,510
you're involved in open-source are

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,890
probably not involved in robots perhaps

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,210
except as a hobby so I'll tell you a

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,439
little bit about what the problem is

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,960
that we need to solve with

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,239
infrastructure software and robots talk

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,000
about how we got to where we are and

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,309
then if you'll indulge me I just have a

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,170
few ideas of about you know what has

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,230
made our project successful in the way

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,360
that it's been successful so to roll

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,210
this back to the beginning our origin

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,950
story for starting this open-source work

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,350
in robots has the same origin story that

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
a lot of open source projects do in our

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,899
case I was working in a robotics lab at

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,000
USC starting in the late 90s and we were

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,859
working for a couple of professors there

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,149
in the upper left Miami tartan gafsa

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,799
Katmai and then there were a few of us

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,460
students and postdocs in the upper right

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,479
and lower right who our goal was to do

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,040
science with robots

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,930
we had robots and we needed to do

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,509
projects with them to develop algorithms

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,640
test hypotheses write papers and so on

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,049
but to make that happen we needed a lot

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,939
of infrastructure software to run the

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,619
robot before we could do the science on

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,140
top and so we had robots like that one

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,200
you see in the lower right that's a

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,880
pioneer robot it its venerable robot

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,680
that's being used in lots of labs and at

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,450
the time that robot came with some

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,909
closed source software that was made by

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,040
the vendor the manufacturer of the robot

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,360
also sold you a license to its closed

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,090
source software that you used to

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,729
interact with all of its peripherals now

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,350
we were using that and but of course it

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,119
had problems and it had failings and

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,920
eventually we decided that we should

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,270
just build our own we're of course you

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,140
know computer science grad students we

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,659
can figure this out

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,610
so we wrote what became player and

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,100
eventually the player stage project and

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,290
player is a tool that's still used out

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,090
there now which basically gives you

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,380
access to a bunch of device drivers and

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,259
a handful of algorithms and some

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,179
developer tools to let you build what we

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,259
now think of as robot robot applications

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,890
at the time we were focused on

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,530
supporting science in the lab

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,270
and then to do this work you also need

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,770
really good simulation so players the

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,750
the middleware that runs on the robot

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,220
stage is the simulator that lets you

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,720
simulate those robots when you don't

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,160
have access to the hardware or you want

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,810
to run what-if experiments if you've

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,010
only got one robot and you want to see

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,080
what happens when you put ten in there

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,320
so stage you see pictured in the middle

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,120
and then we put it up on this old

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,170
fashioned thing which you know you may

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,420
or may not have heard of called

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,430
SourceForge and because we were rabid

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,010
grad students we licensed at all gplv2

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,180
and so we put it up there and we didn't

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,459
have any idea what was gonna happen

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,540
in fact in retrospect i now know that we

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,860
did that without officially going

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,630
through the university channels to

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,430
request permission to open-source it and

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,840
that that violated their rules but by

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,750
the time it became successful nobody

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,520
cared to ask about it so what we found

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,680
is that we got users and contributors

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,480
really quickly and other people in other

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,830
labs who were using other kinds of

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,410
robots kind of like the ones you see on

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,880
the right there they were picking up our

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,620
software and adapting it so that it

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,880
would run on their robots and that was

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,350
an eye-opener for us because we'd been

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,940
thinking about this a software that runs

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,040
this one robot and now we start to get

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,780
this sense of abstraction this idea that

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,880
robots just like other computers have

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,470
you can dump them into equivalence

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,989
classes or at least their components

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,459
they have lasers they have cameras they

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,080
have motors and those are all kind of

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,510
the same at some level and you can

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,980
abstract the details away put that stuff

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,860
in configuration files and then use

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,500
common software to control them so that

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,450
became a pretty widely used project

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,610
along the way some of my colleagues in

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,519
the lab Andrew and Nate started working

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,739
on a more advanced simulator and this

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,019
simulator become became called gazebo

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,810
and this is still a system that we

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,600
develop and maintain actively today it's

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,590
a 3d physics based robot simulator and

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,780
it's meant to be a general-purpose

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,299
simulator so you can describe the

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,920
kinematics and the dynamics of any robot

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,540
that you could imagine building you can

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,130
festoon it with sensors you can put it

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,660
out in a 3d environment and you can run

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,340
it around and that might be because

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,190
you're trying to test your new robot

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,750
design it might be because you're trying

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,459
to test your robot software we see

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,880
increasingly Gazebo used in continuous

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,919
integration applications so this is just

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,450
an example on the right of a compilation

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,979
of different applications that people

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,990
have done with Gazebo basically anything

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,729
that you can imagine as a robot it could

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,620
be wheeled it could be legged it could

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,919
be any kind of mccain

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,270
Nicolle structure real or imagined you

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,160
can model it and put it in an

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,979
environment that includes UAVs as well

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,840
and you can simulate it and our approach

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,460
to simulation with this tool is to try

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,470
to make it the best possible stand-in

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,790
for the physical robot so the same

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,740
software that you run against the robot

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,600
hardware you can also run it against

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,820
your simulation and that lets you

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,530
develop at your workstation without

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,180
access to the robot it also as I

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,710
mentioned lets you run headless

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,280
simulations to do continuous integration

00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:03,750
testing so jumping forward a little bit

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,270
we there was a for about a half a dozen

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,039
years in the Bay Area there was a funny

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,080
little robot incubator company called

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,139
Willow Garage it was a privately funded

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,850
R&D company whose goal was just to as

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,800
quickly as possible advanced the

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,740
state-of-the-art in robotics which was

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,350
an ambitious mission and it did that in

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,270
two ways one was to build a

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,560
state-of-the-art research robot platform

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,280
which you see in the lower right that's

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,229
the pr2

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,729
kind of a human scale mobile

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,130
manipulation platform it's on wheels

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,780
it's got arms it's meant to go into labs

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,669
so that people can do research with it

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,380
but we didn't want to ship the robot

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,910
just the hardware we wanted to have

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,710
great software with it so we didn't have

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,389
all these labs this robot was going out

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,370
to reinventing the wheel and building

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,660
all their own infrastructure software so

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,490
we took a lot of those lessons we had

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,200
from the player project we rolled them

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,539
into something that then became Ross or

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,669
the robot operating system despite the

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,810
name it's not an operating system it's

00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,370
actually a set of tools and libraries

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,770
that run on top of an operating system

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,300
so it's an SDK for robot applications if

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,520
you will and I'll say a little bit more

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,820
about that in a minute

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,919
along the way we ended up changing the

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,539
license we said you know Backlund you

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,270
know 20 years ago almost

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,639
it was robotics felt like an academic

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,130
enterprise and let's just do everything

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,570
GPL and we'll make everybody give back

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,520
and we'll build a big community like

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,050
that at this point we could see that

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,460
something was changing and people were

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,169
gonna start hopefully building

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,199
businesses based on this technology and

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,000
we wanted to have more uptake with fewer

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,320
obligations so we went with the BSD

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,460
license and that's what we've we've

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,070
stuck with I'll said a little bit more

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,180
about that later now to get a sense of

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,180
what people do with Ross

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,940
sorry one second let's try that one more

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,140
time there guess so to get an idea about

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,790
what people will do with Ross here's a

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,370
similar compilation from a couple of

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,130
years ago showing some of everything you

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,870
see here is using Ross and this is one

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,460
of the ways in fact we find out who uses

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,350
our software because as an open-source

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,760
project you don't have to tell us what

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,290
you're doing you don't ask us before you

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,320
download it we don't track who's

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,720
downloading it and if you don't tell us

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,610
we'll never know so every couple of

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,410
years we put out a call for videos and

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,850
we said we're gonna make a montage to

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,770
tell the community what it is we're

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,600
doing and luckily a lot of people who

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,730
work with robots like to show off their

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,710
videos especially once you've got it

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,750
working you immediately take a video so

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,430
we get lots of videos in and you can see

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,820
kind of the breadth of applications and

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,130
this is everything from you know crazy

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,170
humanoid walking robots that are used in

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,780
research to delivery robots that are

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,580
used in production to increasingly

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,140
outdoor robots by which I mean cars that

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,490
are on the road doing advanced driver

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,680
assistance systems and autonomous

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,720
driving because really all those systems

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,700
are fundamentally robots in the sense

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,460
that they connect sensors to actuators

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:59,220
with some algorithms in between so what

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,430
is Ross at its core like I said it's an

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,160
SDK so we take a distributed systems

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,870
approach to building the system and

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,030
that's why the the left-hand side with

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,980
the little arrows and ovals is meant to

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,100
indicate that it is a distributed system

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,000
so we look at solving robotics problems

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,520
as fundamentally a problem of

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,250
decomposing the the task into smaller

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,450
pieces and we follow the old UNIX

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,890
methodology of building small tools each

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,330
of which does one thing well and then

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,030
being able to hook those things together

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,470
to build composite systems so in a raw

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,810
space system you'll often see on a

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,130
complex robot dozens of processes

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,740
running one of them might be talking to

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,150
a laser one of them might be talking to

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,680
a camera those are your sensor drivers

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,300
at the front end that they're then

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,500
talking to some intermediate components

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,260
that are doing filtering that are doing

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,730
processing that are building models and

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,830
then that's going through to your

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,480
decision pipeline which is which is

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,250
saying okay here's our goal

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,260
let's make a plan to that goal let's

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,550
develop controls along the way that will

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,120
apply to the motors and then that goes

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,579
out to the motors and that's in the core

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,959
in the plumbing now that there are lots

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,550
of great middleware systems out there in

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,720
our case we built our own we think it's

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,829
pretty good there are other ones that

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,779
you could drop in and as I'll mention

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,490
toward the end we're actually gonna get

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,930
rid of our own bespoke middleware system

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,279
and adopt an existing middleware

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,540
standard because it turns out some other

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,970
people have worked on that problem as

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,740
well where we really shine with respect

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,050
to robotics is in the middle two

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,970
categories it's in the developer tools

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,699
and it's in the capabilities and by that

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,680
I mean for the developer tools writing

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,760
robot software is just as hard as

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,560
reading all the other software in the

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,480
world but you also have interaction with

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,279
the physical world you've got this

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,560
asynchronous environment that is

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
presenting your sensors with noisy and

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,089
uncertain information you have to take

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,980
that in and within some semblance of

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,149
real-time decide what to do and then

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,399
take action and there's always

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,260
uncertainty in your action as well so

00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,850
you've got this complex asynchronous

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,920
distributed system you need really good

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,680
tools to help understand what's going on

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,269
inside it so we put a lot of effort into

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,740
the tools that let you for example take

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,019
all the data from your robot and

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,360
visualize it in a consistent 3d frame

00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,440
that you can fly around and that's kind

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,850
of telling you what the robot is

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,529
thinking you can take all the camera

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,390
images all the laser scans all those

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,250
point clouds put all that together then

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,899
you can see what the robot sees and then

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,149
you can try to understand why there are

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,649
about doing what it's doing we also put

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,990
a lot of effort into data logging and

00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,420
playback and again into simulation which

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,890
is another kind of developer tool now in

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,810
the capability side it turns out that

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,339
this idea of abstraction can also be

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,339
applied to the algorithms because once

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,350
you've got a common sense of how a

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,300
camera image gets formatted before it

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,890
comes into your perception pipeline now

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,170
your perception pipeline can be

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,420
independent of the details of the

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,430
hardware and that means that we can have

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,529
well-understood solutions to common

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,690
problems and we can package those up as

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,250
open source reusable capabilities that

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,319
people can take off the shelf and put

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,850
into their product so we've gotten to

00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:52,949
that point now kind of our flagship

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,079
example of that is indoor navigation so

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,130
if you wanted to put a mobile robot in

00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,050
an environment like the one we're

00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,880
standing in here you wanted it to roam

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,920
around build a map keep track of where

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,970
it is and be able to go from point A to

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,889
point B without running into stuff

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,360
that's off the shelf and Ross you take

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,860
that you put it on your robot it will

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,060
work you may have to customize it for

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,339
the details of the environment but

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,290
you've got the beginnings of of an

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,879
actual product there and then it's the

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,589
our goal in building all this and

00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:19,779
putting it out there in open source is

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,100
to get you as quickly as possible to

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,569
being able to do your application

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,160
whether that application is doing

00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,990
research in an environment like this

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,790
whether it's doing education or whether

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,379
it's actually fielding a product and

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,060
then it's on you to figure out what's

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,319
that robot gonna usefully do as a side

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,389
effect of movement within this

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:38,829
environment there's a a sub community

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:41,800
within the RAAF's community called Ross

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,470
industrial this started about five years

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,910
ago and this game is a surprise to us so

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,310
if you think about robotics there's kind

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,079
of a new focus on robots now but robots

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,120
have been with us since the 50s

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,149
depending on exactly how you count it

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,370
and they were almost all robot arms big

00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,170
strong stiff robot arms used almost

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,879
exclusively in automotive manufacturing

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,069
where they have completely dominated

00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,470
that manufacturing process and they've

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,540
been really successful there's something

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,509
like one and a half million industrial

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,559
robots fielded in the world today

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,350
nothing compared to the scaled mobile

00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,569
device adoption of course but mobile

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,189
robots are big capex items and so you

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,589
you know you you buy them only when you

00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:22,209
need them but they had a limitation

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,040
which is that they had kind of an

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,529
old-fashioned programming model which

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,209
was that you would buy the robot from

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,529
the vendor the vendor supplied you with

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,870
a control system that had its own

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,250
embedded specialized closed programming

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,949
language and then you wrote in that

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,509
language in that system and you hold it

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:38,829
access to whatever it was they put in

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,629
the controller box that they shipped to

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,220
you and that controller box got safety

00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:43,540
certified by somebody ten years earlier

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,759
and there's no way that it has like a

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,370
USB 3 port on it so you can plug in your

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
do depth camera so what these folks are

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,120
doing is taking that system of an

00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,439
industrial robot that's electrically and

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,879
mechanically really capable an

00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,100
industrial controller box that's been

00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,540
safety certified and is rated and is

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,189
good at what it does which is real-time

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,980
control and then you pack another

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,360
computer on top and you run Linux and

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,709
you run Ross and you plug in your

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,899
sensors and you get access to all these

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:10,480
new algorithms and then you have that

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,220
that second box do supervisory control

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,870
of the robot so the robot is still doing

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,110
what it's meant to be doing but you take

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,060
all the reasoning up to a higher level

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,380
and then you can generate trajectories

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,690
and send those down to the robot tell

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,220
the robot what to do this gets you more

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,480
capabilities you could solve problems

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,519
that you couldn't solve before it also

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,839
makes your application portable because

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,390
one of the crazy things about the

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,250
industrial robot market is that you have

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,950
the old way of doing it is you program

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,839
in cucas language or a bebés language or

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,130
fanox language they each invented their

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,540
own programming language for their

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,209
robots which means you can make an

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,250
entire factory of automation with robots

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,079
and if you want to go from one vendors

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,310
are about to another you have to throw

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,620
everything away and rewrite it all from

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,089
scratch this is the the craziest kind of

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,820
old-fashioned industrial vendor lock-in

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,769
you can imagine so it's this is still

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,540
you know on the way up but I think this

00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,490
has huge promise for disrupting the way

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,990
that people build advanced work cells

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:07,410
and factories now more recently as we've

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,050
been developing Ross we've adopted the

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,540
that now tried-and-true model of putting

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,160
together distributions so Ross comprises

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,440
many many packages there are thousands

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,060
of them that do everything from sensor

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,220
drivers through algorithms and developer

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,920
tools out to planners and controllers

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,779
and it's not convenient to think about

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,040
all those packages independently and

00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,959
pick the versions that you want of each

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,390
one it's much more convenient like most

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,399
of us do with a Linux distribution is to

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,170
find one that has a codenamed release

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,760
that I like and I'll take that and I

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,199
have some understanding of what pieces

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,089
go in there and I have some belief that

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,769
the people who put it together checked

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,300
to make sure that all the Constituent

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,130
constituent packages more or less work

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,990
together so that's one of the roles that

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,230
we play at Open robotics in addition to

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,820
developing the core software we're also

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,500
making the distributions so if you like

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,360
it's it's almost it's it would be kind

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,519
of similar to us doing both the Linux

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,230
kernel hacking and doing the

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,329
distribution management like a canonical

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,040
or a Debian so we take all these

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,510
packages together we roll them out into

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,980
the distributions we give them code

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,140
names we give them turtle logos because

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,940
we like turtles and every year on May

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,470
23rd which according to Wikipedia at

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,750
least is world turtle day I don't know

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,519
if that's really that official we make a

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,810
new Ross distribution release we used to

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,790
do them every six months but we found

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,470
that people weren't taking them up that

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,240
fast anyway and it was a ton of work for

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,890
us and now we do them once a year and if

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,600
you find people using Ross they'll very

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,250
closely identify with these distros

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,170
they'll tell you I'm running on indigo

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,709
or I'm you know I'm hoping to upgrade to

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,709
lunar city

00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:36,869
in terms of penetration and community

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,639
size so one of the things I often get

00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,529
asked is how many people use Ross and as

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,389
all of you who are you know involved in

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,360
open source projects can attest that's

00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,529
almost an impossible question to answer

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,939
it's just by the very nature of the

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,230
system the fact that you can anonymously

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:51,059
take the code there's no registration

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,879
wall or anything like that we'll never

00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,619
really know but like all of you we also

00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,959
watch our server logs and try to make

00:15:55,619 --> 00:16:00,089
inferences about our community size so

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,980
one of the things we look at is how many

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,040
people are downloading binary Debian

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,749
packages from a server that we host or

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,149
actually we pay Oregon State University

00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:11,220
open-source lab to host in Oregon this

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,319
is packages rasta org and this is where

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,569
our build farm that takes in all the

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,339
open-source Ross packages converts them

00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,319
into source and then binary debs and

00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,059
shoves them onto the server that's where

00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,949
all that stuff goes and so we watched

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,339
the Downloads from there so literally

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:29,309
we're just parsing Apache logs here and

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:31,949
we can see that we're now something

00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:33,990
approaching a quarter million unique IPS

00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,730
per month that are accessing this server

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,189
and that's up almost a hundred percent

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,040
over last year so on the first point in

00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:44,129
terms of scale a couple hundred thousand

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,749
active IPs in a month that is on par

00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,579
with what we see in terms of unique

00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:49,170
visitors to our other services and so we

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,970
think that's about you know that's a

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,679
decent lower bound on our community size

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,970
but it is definitely a lower bound

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,829
because we don't expect everybody to be

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,329
active every month and also when we're

00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,980
not accounting for mirrors or plenty of

00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:01,290
mirrors of this package server of our

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,850
documentation server and so on so we

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,589
think we've got easily hundreds of

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,449
thousands of users which within the

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,909
world of robotics it's not that big a

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,199
community and so we think that it's you

00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,179
know we've got a lot of penetration

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,679
within this community I'll also mention

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,870
that the hundred percent growth year

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,029
every year I think is not due to just

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,889
people downloading these packages I

00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,270
think it's in part due to robots and as

00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:23,520
we've got more companies out there that

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,079
are selling Ross based products I think

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,179
part of their provisioning procedure is

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,010
probably fetching packages from us

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:34,770
flashing those on to the robots before

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:38,940
shipping them out in terms of geographic

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,409
reach we so we we also track Google

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,070
Analytics in this case we're looking at

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,230
who

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,240
looking at our documentation servers and

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,130
if we go back to when we started

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,200
tracking this about five years ago we

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,120
saw what at the time we thought of as

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,290
the kind of state of the hierarchy of

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,480
influence within the robotics community

00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,110
with the US on top Germany a close

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,240
second

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,560
Japan and then we might get others in

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,510
Europe and then we might get others in

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,860
Asia and what's happened over the last

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,990
five years when we look at our server

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,970
logs is we see something that reflects

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,470
also the new understanding within the

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,020
robotics community about where all the

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,250
activity is we now see China has jumped

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,110
to number two and if I showed you the

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,270
numbers you'd see that China is actually

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,120
within about 1 percent of the US and

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,220
probably about to overtake and in fact I

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,960
was in Beijing six weeks ago and

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,670
somebody pointed out to me that we're

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,560
we're almost certainly doing we're under

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,050
counting China because we're only

00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,850
counting those visitors that Google

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,410
Analytics scores is being from China and

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,630
a lot of those folks are exiting China

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,920
by way of VPNs and so we're under County

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,140
in the actual Chinese visitors and we're

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,940
over countering over counting their VPN

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,280
exit points which most of which are in

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,660
the rest of Asia for example if I showed

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,040
you the numbers Google Analytics

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,530
actually tells us that one in every

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,510
thousand people in Singapore is looking

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,920
at the Ross documentation which I find

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,570
it hard to believe that one in a

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,980
thousand people in any country is even

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,050
involved in robotics so I think they

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,230
have a lot of VPN exit points there but

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,900
still this kind of shows the the rise of

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,940
China in one sense but then more broadly

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,650
just the importance of Asia within this

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,120
community which historically wasn't the

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,740
case we've got six out of the top ten

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,650
the users of our software coming from

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,170
Asia now let's talk about commercial

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,270
impact so like I said when I get into

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,560
this in the late 90s robots were just I

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,480
thought they were way more interesting

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,040
than like websites and databases and so

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,540
I worked on robots I thought it was

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,390
purely an academic pursuit it would

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,370
never come to anything but times are

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,810
changing and we can look just over the

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,150
last couple of years and see a couple of

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,220
significant events to which I like to

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,960
think we had something to make something

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,330
to make in terms of a contribution so on

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,980
the left hand side there's a company

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,640
called here that was a division of Nokia

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,800
and they were doing mapping with cars

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,480
they they had cars that were not

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,950
autonomous you have a person drive it

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,750
but it's basically a Google Streetview

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:56,730
like car it's got cameras lasers GPS I

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,500
you other sensors perhaps it's taking

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,170
all that data in as you drive around and

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,840
then reconstructing that to build Maps

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,850
street-level photorealistic maps now one

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,560
day one of the people I knew it had here

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,150
contacted me and said hey I just want to

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,040
let you know that we've got a fleet of

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,750
these vehicles of a couple of hundred of

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,910
them they're running on six continents

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,790
seven days a week and gathering data and

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,020
it's all running Ross and I I mean I had

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,250
no idea right this is how you find out

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,460
people use your project is they just

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,750
tell you and I thought it was great

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,330
because it's a it's a really cool

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,190
example of how this is basically half of

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,770
a robot it's got all the sensor data

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,450
coming in and it's it's doing some

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,800
processing on that sensor data but it's

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,180
not actually deciding what to do but

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,980
that's okay they still found the tools

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,300
useful enough that they built the whole

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,220
system using Ross and then just you know

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,530
18 months after we or a year and a half

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,570
or a bit more after we wrote that kind

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,390
of disclosed that with Nokia they ended

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,160
up selling themselves to a German car

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,160
consortium for two and a half billion

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,170
dollars to not billion euros on the

00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,730
right-hand side you can see in a

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,230
different market precision precision

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,640
agriculture this is an area it's getting

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,200
a lot of attention within the robotics

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,780
community now especially in countries

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,600
where for one reason or another there is

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,820
insufficient labor to do food production

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,160
so now people are looking at robots as a

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,020
way to offset that issue as well as

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,510
perhaps make the whole system more

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,730
productive blue river is a company in

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:24,210
the bay area that makes a precision

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,220
robotic tool that does selective

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,510
thinning of lettuce plants so it turns

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,550
out when you plant lettuce you over

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,020
plant them and then you come back after

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,430
they've sprouted and you see which ones

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,810
look healthy and you get rid of some of

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,250
them in order to achieve an optimal

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,440
spacing this is a problem I didn't know

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,390
was out there but it's very common in

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,710
agriculture agriculture and the current

00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,660
state of the art to do that or before

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,280
these guys came along to do the thinning

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,990
process was to send people into the

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,130
fields with long handled hose and they

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,140
would implement this optimization

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,490
algorithm while walking down the row to

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
setting how to space them and and

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,240
physically removing the ones they wanted

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,500
to remove these guys came up with a

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,130
system where you have a person drive a

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,930
tractor it tows behind it an array of

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,970
these basically little robots it's got a

00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,650
camera at the front pointing down and it

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,179
looks at the plants as it goes over and

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,429
at the back of the same device you have

00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,259
a high concentration fertilizer sprayer

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:12,659
and so the now you've got a computer

00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,129
deciding given some look ahead buffer

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,629
which ones do I want to keep which ones

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,710
do I want to get rid of and you spray

00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,299
the ones you want to get rid of with the

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,369
high concentrator fertilizer it kills

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,659
them it's a little robot it's actually a

00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:24,210
whole array of them they get towed by a

00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,100
tractor and last I heard they were

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,299
processing something like ten percent of

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,340
all the lettuce grown in this country

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,169
has that those guys robots involved in

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,690
it and that's a Ross based robot that's

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,899
a little vision guided robot and they

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,009
just last month it was announced that

00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,450
John Deere picked them up for three

00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,919
hundred million dollars so I'm not

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,869
saying that if we write about your

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,419
company on our blog that you'll have a

00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:48,389
huge exit but I it's pretty likely it

00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,490
seems okay so now I thought I'd talk

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:52,769
about just a little bit on lessons

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,769
learned and so what what are the things

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,960
that we focused on along the way so one

00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,940
I hinted at earlier and and you're

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,379
you're all already immersed in this and

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,029
probably have strong opinions one way or

00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:07,950
the other I'll just kind of tell you are

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,999
are kind of origin story on this like I

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,690
said earlier we were doing everything

00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:14,610
with the GPL and when we started working

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,559
on Ross we explicitly wanted to make

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,950
this the thing that the industry would

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,649
build its products on and we decided we

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,789
would go with the three clause bsd that

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,299
was kind of the best guidance at the

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:29,279
time very permissive license lots of you

00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,799
know it's been tested a lot out in the

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,289
community more recently we've switched

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,480
over to the Apache 2.0 so all new code

00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,480
that we write is Apache 2 licensed we

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,429
keep the old code 3 Clause BSD we just

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,559
feel like the Apache 2 it has a lot of

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,539
the same protections and permissions

00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,190
while being a little more you know

00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:49,740
modern with respect to things like

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,419
software patents one of the other things

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,450
we did though because we didn't want to

00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:56,009
make this so I'll say that we in that in

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,200
those sentences is those of us

00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:59,549
developing the core of Ross we're

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,659
choosing that as our license but we

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,389
didn't want to put that on our whole

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,340
community so we did what many of you

00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:07,440
might take to be controversial or overly

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,379
complicated as we federated the whole

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,909
system and said we don't require a

00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:13,889
particular license attached to your

00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,539
package we divide Ross up into packages

00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:18,570
but you just have to declare what

00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,649
license it is you're using and so we

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,779
have a whole set of tools and

00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,110
infrastructure and websites that present

00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,660
this in

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,100
Meishan that allow you to put a manifest

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,750
file in your package you declare what

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,309
license it is our tools will go through

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,080
and pull that out and allow everybody to

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,390
find all the packages and understand

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,220
what licenses they are under and so that

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,890
lets you as the author maintain control

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,360
over what licenses are going to attach

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,620
also because you don't have to give the

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,970
code to us we're not gonna host it on

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,590
our server you're gonna put it up in

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,929
github or bitbucket or whatever you like

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,059
to keep code you get to control how the

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,890
development work happens on it when the

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,809
releases happen and so on so we really

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:54,450
try to Feder ate the whole developer

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:59,820
workflow for these packages as much as

00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:03,600
possible another thing is we spend a lot

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,540
of effort doing community support online

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,830
and we're I guess I could have mentioned

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,230
this in the beginning we're a small

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:15,419
organization our company is 20 people

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:17,160
and and most of us are doing hands-on

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,990
development all day we're trying to do

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,130
new development you know adding new

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,980
features to the platform we're also

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,799
doing maintenance you know pulling in

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,690
patches and so on but we're also doing

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,120
this kind of community mentoring

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,559
community management role and that is

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,790
taking care of things like our

00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,530
documentation site

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,620
it's our continuous integration server

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,090
that does pull request testing it also

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,880
does all the source and binary deb

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,470
generation and we also have our own Q&A

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,990
forum we use a spot which is an open

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,540
source alternative to things like Stack

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,650
Overflow and I just point this out to

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,090
say that if you're thinking about

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,320
starting a new open source community

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,150
this is something that you can't

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,450
possibly pay too much attention to that

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,530
the time and effort that you spend

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,870
interacting with the community answering

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,970
questions you know fostering newcomers

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:05,040
that's how you build critical mass and

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,870
if you you know if you don't do that

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,970
it's unlikely that you'll ever build a

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,700
substantial community I like to think

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:15,030
that in our case we we've gotten to this

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,320
success that we have now in spite of all

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,150
the technical mistakes we made along the

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,980
way there's lots of things in the code

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,809
that could be a whole lot better and

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,910
they are getting better all the time but

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,110
even though we got all that stuff to the

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,030
extent that we did we got that stuff

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,280
wrong we put a lot of effort into

00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,380
building a community and that in the end

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,990
is gonna be robust against any number of

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,179
you know technical choices that we might

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,520
need to go back and revisit

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,770
now as part of that community we

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,179
sometimes try to figure out who is

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,440
actually contributing to the codes this

00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,660
is my cot one of my colleagues till a

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,640
foot went back to our most widely used

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,799
Ross distribution this is Ross indigo

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,690
that came out a few years ago and he

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,250
went back and found for all of the

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,830
packages that were released in that Ross

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,220
distribution for all of them that are

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,740
stored on github how what are all the

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,350
names of the committers who made changes

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,549
that went into that distribution and he

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,760
wouldn't fit it on couldn't fit on on

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:12,910
one slide or two but it took three so we

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,160
have you know over 2,800 people made

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,950
actual code contributions that went into

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,870
this distribution that we a team of 20

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,530
people nominally kind of take credit for

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,090
and take responsibility for so it's we

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,650
couldn't do what we're doing without the

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,760
efforts of all those people and they

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,970
wouldn't do what they're doing

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,040
I think without the efforts that we put

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,809
in in terms of managing that community

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,240
and that's that has everything to do

00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:40,870
with those online interactions but also

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,000
in-person interactions so we actually

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,650
did we organized our own conference we

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,820
call it Ross con it's a Ross developers

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,760
conference we've done it every year

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,710
since 2012 we just finished up our last

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,260
one in 2017 it happened last month in

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,330
Vancouver and that's a group photo that

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,040
we took at the end of the show we do it

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,960
as a two-day very technically oriented

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,660
developers meeting it's a it's a

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,280
singletrack event I encourage you to

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,559
come if you have any interest in robots

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,330
we'll do another one next year but what

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,309
I want to point out here is that first

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,380
of all who knew that you could get 500

00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:12,940
people as we did this year to spend two

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,440
days talking about open-source robot

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,940
software I mean it seems like such an

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,049
incredibly niche topic that you would

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,090
never get that many people who are

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:20,650
willing to travel and do that but they

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,720
do in fact they're super passionate

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,919
about it and that's one of the goals of

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,360
a meeting like this is to get those

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,010
people together to have them share their

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,870
passion with each other that's how we

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,520
all get recharged and we go back to it

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,740
and we keep you know doing this

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,750
development for our day job and in our

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,460
spare time and we take all the really

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,070
frank feedback that people give us

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,380
online about our our decisions and about

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,210
our suggested patches and it's we we

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,309
know we kind of remember how good it

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,419
felt to all hang out together and get to

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,980
know each other

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,299
tons of those those classic interactions

00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,889
you do at medians even like this one

00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:52,389
where you run into somebody and you

00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:54,009
realize that that's that person you've

00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:55,299
been working on with on the internet for

00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:59,350
10 years and you never met that person

00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:01,059
before another strategy that we've

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,489
really embraced is to bridge to

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:05,679
everything so ross is not the only thing

00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:07,330
out there for doing robot software there

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,679
are things that came before including

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,970
systems like the one that I built when I

00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,100
was at USC called player that I

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,840
mentioned earlier there are other

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,789
systems that are being built now as well

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,480
and some of them are very popular in

00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:21,009
specific communities like the one on the

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,049
on the left over there called moose is

00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,669
very popular with underwater vehicles

00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,220
it's it's a distributed communication

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,359
system but it's very sparing with the

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,710
number of bits that it uses because

00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,499
you're going over acoustic modems in

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,720
that case so there are these like narrow

00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:37,570
systems that that get popular in certain

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,309
areas and we've never tried to displace

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,259
those things we just connect to

00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,669
everything we say well we don't we're

00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,629
not trying to tell you to use Ross if

00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:45,399
you've got a thing that works really

00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:47,169
well then let's figure out how to just

00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:48,999
make the most minimal bridge possible to

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,470
connect your thing to my thing so that

00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:52,299
you can use the tool that you want and

00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,679
then eventually maybe it becomes a

00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,299
hybrid system or maybe you end up

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,950
adopting Ross wholesale but that's

00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:58,659
that's been a core aspect of our

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,519
strategy is not to think about this as

00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,200
any kind of competition we just want to

00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,549
make connections to everything and

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,549
reinvent as little as possible

00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,679
something else it's helped I think a lot

00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:13,299
has been the access to common hardware

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,279
and this is something that has resolved

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:19,330
itself in the rest of the IT industry

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,519
pretty you know naturally with the

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,009
growth of common workstations and

00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,830
laptops and now mobile devices kind of

00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,389
it's they all have common components

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,669
that are all similar enough that you

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:32,169
don't really you know if everybody has a

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,759
laptop in the room we can all do

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,809
development but it's a little bit

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,220
different with robots because you have

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,289
this physical body which can differ

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,609
dramatically from one robot to the next

00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:42,190
and well you can abstract a lot of it

00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:44,320
away it's really really hard in a lot of

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,940
cases to directly share like all your

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,580
high-level code from one robot to

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,809
another if they're not pretty similar so

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,249
one of the things that we worked on at

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,320
Willow Garage back in the day was the

00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:56,139
pr2 robot and what you're seeing on the

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,080
left there are is the the photo of the

00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:59,850
first 11 of those robots

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,399
that we built at Willow Garage and then

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,649
gave away at no cost to some of the top

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,750
research labs all around the world the

00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:08,730
idea was let's get them all to have the

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,110
same robot with the same software and

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,149
it's all the software is gonna be

00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,769
completely open-source and let's see

00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:17,039
what they do and let's get them actually

00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:19,200
sharing their results which as much as

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,570
you'd like to think that science is

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,519
built on sharing of results and

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,289
reproducibility reproducibility of

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,370
experiments what you'll find is you ever

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,830
get very much in the experimental

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,960
sciences that'll that's not as true as

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,149
you'd like it to believe and the idea of

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,100
having somebody else in another lab be

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:37,649
able to directly reproduce your

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,049
experiment maybe refute your results by

00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,639
using your code that historically has

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:43,440
not been very popular and that's one of

00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:45,299
the things that we tried and I think

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,750
made some effort to made some effective

00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:52,380
changing with the pr2 program more you

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,669
know recently and on at a lower size are

00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,929
the turtle bots that you see on the

00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:57,419
right

00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,179
so the pr2 is a great robot you can

00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,399
still buy them they cost about $400,000

00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,230
u.s. so not everybody can have one

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
probably and so for those of you who

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,940
can't we decided that we should have

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,820
something that still runs Ross and is a

00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,440
first-class supported platform but it's

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,909
gonna be a little lower cost so we came

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,380
up with a turtle bot the top two or the

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:18,600
turtle bots one on the left and the two

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,039
on the right there based on repurposed

00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,510
vacuum cleaner bases the one on the

00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,429
left's the iRobot create which you might

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,990
have played with when when it first came

00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:27,929
out and it's just come back as well and

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,130
then so those run about two thousand

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,899
dollars and the idea is that this is a

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,460
mobile robot it's got a depth sensor on

00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,230
it it can do all that indoor navigation

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,450
stuff that I mentioned earlier it runs

00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:40,019
Ross as a first-class supported platform

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,370
but it's $2,000 which means you you prop

00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:43,139
me you might not buy it for a hobby

00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,809
project but you might get your lab to

00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:47,429
buy it for you know research purposes or

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,470
you might get a teacher to buy a handful

00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:51,059
of them for educational purposes more

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,519
recently we worked with robotics which

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:55,440
is a robot company in South Korea to

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,490
build the turtle bot 3 which are on the

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,200
bottom there the one on the left is

00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,289
called a burger the one on the right is

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,149
called the waffle and they are much

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,039
smaller so the the burger I could hold

00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:08,419
between my two hands like this and then

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,800
the waffle is about this big and that

00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,690
those run about 500 and about

00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,950
$1500 each something like that so we're

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,780
trying to push that price down to make

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,790
this whole thing more accessible with

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,830
the theme being that we make these

00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,140
systems as open as possible so with the

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,120
turtlebot trees for example not only do

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,100
you get a single board ARM based

00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,930
computer of some kind that runs Linux

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,490
and runs Ross and has you know pretty

00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:34,500
much all open-source software on it but

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:36,330
you also get an a an arm cortex-m

00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,040
microcontrollers a smote err controller

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,540
board that is also totally open so you

00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,980
can reprogram all the motor controller

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,300
firmware if you think you know how to do

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,060
servo control better than the people who

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,070
built the servos so that is we we make

00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,230
all that stuff open all the way down we

00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,550
give out a platform that you can that

00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,980
allows you to actually share your

00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,480
applications across robots and then from

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,220
that we hope to see growth in the space

00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,700
of these shared applications something

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,070
also we did is we took decided to take

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,140
neutrality very serious seriously so as

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,000
I said when we started the Ross project

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,580
we were at a company called Willow

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,490
Garage which was ostensibly a for-profit

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,500
entity that just happened to be spending

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,000
all almost all of its resources building

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,980
and giving away robot hardware and robot

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,470
software and that's really cool that's

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,640
really great and a lot of people you

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,230
told that to they'd say wow that's

00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,820
awesome how do I get more of that but

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,650
then sometimes the more serious people

00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,090
in established companies say wait a

00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,730
minute that sounds like your free lunch

00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:35,310
I'm sure that eventually you're gonna

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,360
compete with me or or if you keep doing

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,800
this you're just gonna go out of

00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,510
business or something else right they

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,679
were you know asking themselves why is

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,030
it that you're doing this I kind of

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,470
don't understand the motivation and

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,040
there were some folks out there who did

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:49,260
not adopt Ross exactly because they felt

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,820
like there wasn't a neutral steward to

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,490
the project and so that's what we did in

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,650
creating open robotics which is an

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,600
umbrella brand that encompasses the open

00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,990
source robotics Foundation which is a

00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,910
501 C 3 public charity as well as an

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,610
open source robotics corporation which

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,280
is a subsidiary body which is a taxable

00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,450
entity and that's that's the entity

00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,250
through which we do work with industry

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,540
so if you're familiar with the way that

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,460
Mozilla ended up organized were

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,520
organized in a fundamentally similar way

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,530
but the key thing there was even more

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,120
than the nonprofit versus profit was to

00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,990
have a company that was dedicated to

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,670
stewarding the project and that's

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,650
in creating open robotics and that's how

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,480
we can go out and tell the world this is

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,430
what we do we make open source software

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,730
for robots and we want all of you to use

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:35,740
it I guess I don't have to tell this

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,930
group this but I truly believe that

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,630
openness accelerates whole industries

00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,830
I'm showing you here kind of a highlight

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,230
of some of the products and services

00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,210
that are out in the world today that you

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,860
can either you know buy or get

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,930
prototypes of or at least experience in

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,430
some way that are using Ross and that's

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,140
everything from on the upper left you've

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,550
got agricultural applications coming

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,710
down through self-driving vehicles

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,900
delivery applications of various kinds

00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,430
on the right side you've got the the

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,050
whole logistics space there's a whole

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,720
new generation of robots that are

00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,890
roaming around factories and warehouses

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,080
moving stuff from one point to another

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,670
now they don't need lines they don't

00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,200
need wires buried in the concrete or

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,840
fiducials on the walls they can navigate

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,119
around just fine by themselves a lot of

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,560
those are running Ross I would guess

00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,850
it's a majority of the new entrance to

00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,280
the market but that's sort of hard to

00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,080
measure you've also got some security

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,300
applications as well as some emerging

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,500
consumer products people are still

00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,359
trying to figure out what a home robot

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,950
should do everybody seems to want a home

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,480
robot home robot or they want to build a

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,859
home robot but we're still trying to

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,090
figure out once it's in your home what's

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,150
it's actually gonna what's it gonna do

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:41,050
for you if it's not you know vacuuming

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:45,700
so let's see what is next we are hard at

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:47,800
work on Ross - so the details of that

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,630
are beyond the scope of this discussion

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,790
to get into like what we're changing but

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,109
fundamentally we want to cover some use

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,790
cases that we didn't really cover the

00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:57,520
first go-round now we've got almost 10

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,720
years of experience to look back and see

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,369
what are the things we would have done

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,050
differently and now we're going after

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:03,640
some smaller systems some bigger

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,260
distributed systems and things like

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,200
real-time control in a more serious way

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,450
as well as just pushing for easier and

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,250
better product development as I've

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,420
argued we have plenty of companies out

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,100
there now that are shipping products

00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,070
based on Ross but they're also some that

00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,150
are not yet and we're trying to try to

00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:23,859
close that gap as much as we can

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,690
we're also hard at work on the next big

00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,600
version of Gazebo and they're we're

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,160
focused on doing cloud hosted simulation

00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,920
this is this is one of those tasks that

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,050
lends itself really naturally to being

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,240
put in the cloud it's it's a

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,670
kind of application it tends to be

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,620
platform dependent it's the kind of

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,260
thing that it works best if you run it

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,640
on a Linux system with an NVIDIA GPU and

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,110
a correctly configured set of drivers

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,580
and that's just one of those things that

00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,440
you don't always have right in front of

00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,700
you so it's much easier if you can do

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,430
that up in the cloud and we've we've

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,290
done a lot of things using gazebo what

00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,940
for cloud hosted simulation actually for

00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,230
a bunch of government R&D projects and

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,670
various domains and now we're looking at

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,350
how to make that just more broadly

00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,540
accessible so people can use it in

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,670
everything from continuous integration

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,260
to education if you want to have all of

00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,150
your students suddenly be programming a

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,320
very realistically simulated robot we

00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,110
can just do that all in the cloud and

00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,260
they'll have some web interface to it

00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:19,900
and then finally I'll mention kind of

00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,770
the the next the next big thing I don't

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:29,950
know if you've heard about this thing

00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:32,230
called autonomous cars it is there we go

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,550
okay so you know everybody and their

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,990
brother has an autonomous car startup

00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,690
you should all go start one right now

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,490
and you can sell it next week but

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,610
seriously there is a huge amount of

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,310
activity in autonomous cars and advanced

00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,380
driver assistance systems and

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,750
increasingly they're using Ross which

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,790
was surprising to us at first because we

00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,470
built Ross to run on you know research

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,660
robots in labs but then when you think

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,140
about it those cars are also just a kind

00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:01,570
of a robot that happens to be outside so

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,670
two examples I'm showing you here are of

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,830
open source self-driving car

00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,450
software stacks that are completely

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,370
based on Ross so this is taking those

00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,350
tools that I described earlier then

00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,120
layering more capabilities on top and

00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,310
then releasing the result is open source

00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,840
so on the right side is one called Auto

00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,170
where it's from a company in Japan

00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,930
called tier 4 and that's a system that

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,300
will more or less do what they call

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,160
level 3 autonomy out of the box with a

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,440
correctly outfitted car it's not a

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,750
product it's not safety certified you

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,570
should totally not rely on it but it is

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,920
the thing that will get you going toward

00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:40,060
your self driving car product or service

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,770
similarly about the same time on the

00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,780
left hand side Baidu

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,900
which you the company you probably know

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,470
of release their Apollo suffered

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,480
self-driving car stack

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,650
this is also completely based on Ross in

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,390
fact they made a ton of really

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,980
interesting core changes to Ross which

00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,170
we're now talking with them about how to

00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,359
upstream and they've released all of

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,010
that open source so this is Apollo is

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,750
that a large team or Baidu has had a

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,480
large team working on Apollo for the

00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,090
last several years and they're now

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,790
staging the release of Apollo with new

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,670
features in it with the hope of getting

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,440
an entire industry taking this basic

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,109
self driving car functionality as

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,450
something off the shelf and then

00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,859
customizing it testing it certifying it

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:26,000
and rolling it out into products and

00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:29,030
again it's all based on Ross so I'll

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,540
just leave you with one last little

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:34,040
teaser here this is something we do and

00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,650
hold this is an industry we definitely

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,980
want to support is using Ross in serious

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:42,800
ways in cars and also we want to do good

00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,790
simulation of cars and Gazebo as you

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,260
might have seen from those earlier

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:49,130
videos one of the big knocks on gazebo

00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,740
is we did a we were at a conference one

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,030
time and we had a we had a demo where we

00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,890
had gazebo outputting to an oculus

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,210
headset and so you could put it on and

00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,800
then you could experience this fly

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,349
through experience with this quadrotor

00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,030
and we showed it to like a nine-year-old

00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:03,440
and he he did it for a while and then

00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,830
took it off and said that that's pretty

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,270
cool but your graphics suck and I was

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,150
like but the physics are really

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,830
carefully simulated and that's this

00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,660
that's the trade-off we have right as we

00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,920
focus on we come from a robotics

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,599
community where we want to get the

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,300
physics right we want to get the sensor

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,040
models right we're not you know game

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,320
makers or movie makers so we haven't

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,920
historically focused a lot on making

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,970
everything look shiny and photorealistic

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,230
so this is something that some of my

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,270
colleagues did actually just over the

00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,830
course of last week is to you can see

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,540
some of the laser data being simulated

00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,460
there so this is a rough model of a

00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,070
Toyota Prius running through a cityscape

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,330
that we built and here we're basically

00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,250
just taking a bunch of the off-the-shelf

00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,930
game techniques and throwing them in

00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,250
there to bling the whole thing up now in

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,080
part that's just to make it look cooler

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,339
and you should not underestimate the

00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,170
importance of that because making it

00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,580
look cooler will totally you know

00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,349
influence the decisions of people who

00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,690
are going to use it or not but there's a

00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:58,790
serious use here which is that we know

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,560
these cars are going to be using cameras

00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,160
as a key part of their decision-making

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,170
pipe

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,880
and to believe that that system is going

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,099
to work well we need to be able to test

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,349
those systems with realistic sensor

00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:11,180
input and that means that we need to

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:13,460
have and because we know we're never

00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,809
gonna test these cars in the physical

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,420
world as much as we need to we need

00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:19,819
simulations that will produce realistic

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,009
sensor data including camera data to

00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:23,839
feed into these systems to both help

00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:25,549
train them and to test them as part of

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,019
as part of the certification process as

00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:29,059
well as many other aspects of the whole

00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:30,559
development pipeline so this is an area

00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:33,289
where we're starting to put a lot of

00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,309
resources with gazebo is into getting it

00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,230
to the point where it can do

00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:37,940
photorealistic rendering rendering so

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:42,440
that we can support all these new

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,550
applications so with that I will stop

00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,550
and just say thank you

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,550
