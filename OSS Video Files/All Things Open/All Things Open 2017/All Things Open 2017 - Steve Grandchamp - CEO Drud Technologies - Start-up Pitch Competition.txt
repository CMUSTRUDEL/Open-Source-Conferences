good afternoon I'm Steve grant champ I'm

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,450
CEO of dread technologies I can really

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,920
see that's well out there so I see a

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,250
show of hands how many of you in the

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,330
audience are developers okay Wow okay so

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,400
a bunch this would be a good audience

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,910
for me then okay how many of you manager

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,859
rely on developer teams okay so some

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,210
managers and some developers okay good

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,010
news and bad news I guess for everybody

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,960
in that realm the web isn't getting

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,669
simpler for any of us today solving the

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,100
web problem has created a

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,960
multibillion-dollar and still growing by

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,750
the way industry that most of us here

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,030
are part of in some way or another so if

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,160
you run multiple projects on multiple

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,710
versions of multiple text ax with

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,750
multiple hosting providers and of course

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,879
you do or probably your company does the

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,789
hard cost today of environmental setup

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,570
configuration and project switching can

00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:01,070
easily run into two or more hours a day

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,329
per developer so just think about that

00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,220
per developer doing things the

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,020
old-fashioned way doesn't even take into

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,450
account the cost of new developer

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,280
onboarding compatibility problems bug

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,740
fixing and other deployment issues if

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,240
you work on a small team maybe you're an

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,250
individual maybe you work on a midsize

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,259
team maybe you're even working on an

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,110
outsourced team it really doesn't matter

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,790
for teams and businesses all of this is

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,280
costing you it's costing you the

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,070
opportunity for innovation the chance to

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,170
solve higher value problems causes long

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,689
maintenance and innovation cycles and

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,430
for you developers in the room this is

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,079
why your on page of duty you got a bunch

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,670
of unplanned work don't you love those

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,860
fire drills you're part of all the time

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,979
your weekends or nights may be where you

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,229
could be doing different things the end

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,420
of the day on a typical team you could

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,829
be losing a quarter to half of your

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,380
productive developer time to

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,689
environmental configuration issues now

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,820
the containerization paradigm is here

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,770
and it can help I mean who doesn't love

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,939
docker and kubernetes and we heard some

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,130
of that earlier today but they're

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,890
complex right they're not that easy to

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,629
do our self-contained EDF environment

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,660
management tool gets all that complexity

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,860
out of your way you can work on exact

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,960
copies of your product

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,310
Hosting code and its environment

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,350
smoothing you're testing your

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,660
collaboration reducing all the

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,860
deployment headaches you run into

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,620
driving the wrists down while improving

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,620
your product consistency and quality I

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,810
draw it we glue all these technologies

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,330
together we keep them up to date and

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,390
running for you so stop wasting your

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,370
time on configuration compatibility

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,430
issues turn your attention to more

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:51,000
interesting problems delivering a higher

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:53,850
value higher order work by the way this

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,739
is not some day you can do this and our

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,570
partner agencies today hundreds of

00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,770
developers are using drought and EDA in

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,050
production today and they're building

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,870
more than a thousand client websites and

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,870
the productivity increases are really

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,790
are remarkable drug tools have reduced

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,520
the onboarding time for new team members

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,340
and and so we define onboarding as the

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,440
time to deliver a developers first

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,620
production commit so your first

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,269
production commit goes from weeks

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,430
literally two hours and when done of

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,420
those in the United States and they

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,150
don't have that problem so I'm

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,209
responsible for a couple of engineering

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,360
teams okay the problem that you

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,220
presented at the outset is the problem

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,500
which is the Internet's getting more

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,799
complex and I have to have an expert in

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,500
everything and it's bankrupting us so I

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,280
have a little goofy test here you know

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,920
it's I'm not the CTO more than half of

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,440
your audience put up their hands as

00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,030
developers right can I get a show of

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,250
hands on that sixty second intro video

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,620
which was going to explain the whole

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,720
value to this and which to me as an old

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,910
typewriter salesman meant absolutely

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,579
nothing how many of you guys did that

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:19,380
60-second video resonate with versus

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:21,030
just confuse you come someone must have

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,520
gotten some value out of it

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,169
don't be shy put up your hands please I

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,650
can't see it I have my glasses on

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,830
interesting

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,020
okay good enough thank you that was very

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,330
helpful to me because it looked like

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,310
Greek to me but then it resonated with

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,419
at least a subset of your developers

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:44,830
that there is a good thing thank you so

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,780
if I'm a customer how do I get involved

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,360
with your tools so a lot of these

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,460
projects and my perception is a lot of

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,350
your competition and has more of a

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,610
consultative approach to getting to

00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:02,020
their customers so how do I get started

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,750
how does your sales guy introduce what

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,389
you can do to somebody simply so that

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,560
they can start using it without going

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:13,479
through some you know difficult speed up

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,639
process education process to get there

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,870
what how does all that work well the

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,880
first thing you do is you can download

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,340
the tool for free any developer can

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,630
download it today and github and you can

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,190
begin using it for free it's a full

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,160
function tool that's not a crippled tool

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,970
and so the adoption piece will lead to

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,830
the monetization conversation so I I'm

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,960
running a business I download your tool

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,550
what am I gonna use it on first to test

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,530
it on something that won't break before

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,380
I put it on something that it might

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,700
break so how do I you know what's the

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,770
process through which I start to

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,690
understand the value so I can actually

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,280
put it on something that matters so that

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,780
I decide to actually want to pay for it

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,820
I think the first target there would be

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,650
are we a Drupal shop or are we a

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,180
WordPress shop those two technologies

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,970
together drive about half of that

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,349
websites on the web today so our target

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,780
will be let's go after Drupal let's go

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:04,120
after WordPress first it's very easy to

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,099
create a value prop and a set of kind of

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,500
how to's we know where these people live

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,690
we know how to get at them and we can

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,190
get you a jump started in a hurry if

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,410
you're a wordpress developer and you saw

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,360
that 60-second demo it would make total

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,310
sense to you so from an investor's

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,460
standpoint you said you've raised six

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,979
million dollars right today and I can't

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,690
remember if you're raising additional

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,270
dollars we will be we're not currently

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,800
but we will be okay and then

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,710
what are your revenues look like just

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,240
projection wise

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:42,050
years from now and who's your who's your

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,640
potential acquire any of those people I

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,250
put up there as competition could be our

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,950
potential acquirer anybody who's in that

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,450
hosting space anybody who's in the droop

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,150
roll the word press space those are

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,150
potential hire those for sure

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,010
what is your ASP it's about we're

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,870
projecting it to be somewhere in the

00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,870
$25,000 range right for customer yeah

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,110
just one final question we've talked a

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,820
lot about how you approached the

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,160
agencies are doing the web development

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,290
work right

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,050
what are your relationships like with

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,850
the hosters that may be hosting all

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,070
these websites I mean are they a source

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,570
of business for you are there

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,790
relationships the ones you need to play

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,620
on how does that work in yeah I would

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,390
describe it as almost a little bit of a

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,760
coopertition all right so there's a

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,130
couple of them who specifically come to

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,050
us and asked for access to the local

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,840
development tool the first tool D dev

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,460
and so I'll give you a story of a

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,810
partner in Germany that we're working

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,570
with right now and I can't name them

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,090
quite yet but there's an open source

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,760
content management tool it's not Drupal

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,800
it's not WordPress it's called typo3 and

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,390
think of any open source CMS plugging

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,070
into the front end the hosting provider

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,330
in the back end can't be the cloud in

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,970
Germany with the privacy in the data

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,410
protection so Asscher is actually

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,190
contracted with a company called T

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,140
systems to staff a local data center in

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,150
Germany only with German citizens so

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,560
we're building out an API to connect

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,300
typo3 on the front end to the azure

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,040
deployment on the back end that products

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,810
gonna be OEM and white labeled by them

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,790
into Germany so that hosting provider

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,090
can actually be a go to market partner

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,090
for us

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,909
I think our time is up but thank you

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,178
very much to you thank you very much

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,178
