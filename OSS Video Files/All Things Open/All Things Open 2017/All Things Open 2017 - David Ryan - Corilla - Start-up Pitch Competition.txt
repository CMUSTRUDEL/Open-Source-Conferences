it's really great to be here I have a

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,529
quick question any other technical

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,779
writers in the house any documentation

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,960
team I see some hands you gonna like

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,730
this to remember this sound that was the

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,620
sound of software documentation being

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,570
delivered a couple years ago the louder

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,100
that sound the happier your program

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,960
teams were and I can see all the doctor

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,060
people nodding the problem was we

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
started to ask ourselves does just

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,779
making a large book of documentation

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,670
make the lives of our users better does

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,740
this improve our development cycles is

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,050
this even being read is the cost of

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,670
making this book effective well the

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,989
interesting thing we learned was no what

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,579
we learned was that technical writers

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,930
have been forced to yield to use tools

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,700
they hate to create software

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,620
documentation that customers were no

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
longer reading any developers in the

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,390
crowd yeah we've got you too so what's

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,910
interesting is we hear the same thing

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,170
over and over and over every single year

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,449
in this case we have a Stack Overflow

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,430
survey this year the same as last year

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,320
over 80% of developers site that they

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,449
learn how to code through official

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,879
documentation and of course we hear that

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,280
over 34% of them one third of the total

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,890
global population of developers in the

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,350
world complaining that documentation is

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,110
incomplete or that it sucks let's move

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,270
to github again over and over and over

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,299
again we see the same survey every year

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,040
over 93% nearly a hundred percent give

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,320
or take of developers are complaining

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,610
about documentation so this is a problem

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,009
through whatever lens you look at it

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,729
technical writers are unhappy developers

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,049
are unhappy customers are unhappy that's

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,310
the problem so here's the solution

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,110
that's called Carillo we make

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,329
collaborative documentation for software

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,009
teams what's kind of interesting about

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,229
what we do is that we're looking at it

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,970
through three lenses one is that we

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,560
build an environment to write and

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,119
collaborate so think of your Google Doc

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,460
experience you're either paid experience

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,009
for for those of us in open source we

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,509
look at the way to manage our content we

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,490
think of it as putting the em back into

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,590
CMS and then we look at how can we also

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,729
bundle a publishing experience why are

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,890
we getting our technical artists to

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,200
learn how to code now I love git and I

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,820
love Jekyll but if you've ever managed a

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,170
team of technocratic know that it's a

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
waste of time getting to learn how to

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,310
code on a command-line simply to write

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,629
and publish documents so let's do a

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,629
run-through let's have a look at this

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,050
this is korilla so we're going to do an

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,180
auth

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,710
work flow here this is the view where we

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,480
can see all of our existing content

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,850
think of it as like your Google Docs

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,680
view or a file server we're gonna make a

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,180
new piece of documentation it's teaching

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,700
my team how to use Trello for our

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,350
roadmap now once we've made this you're

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
familiar with these kind of editors you

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,380
write your mark down on the left and you

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,510
see the the real-time render on the

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,010
right check this out though as technical

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,840
writers we do a lot of documentation

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,610
screenshots so we're just going to do a

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,050
screenshot simply right there and what I

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,610
love about this the tech pros you're

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,530
going to love this as we simply copy and

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,540
paste it directly into the editor it

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,360
gets uploaded to a version controlled

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,650
file server and there it is if you've

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,630
ever done a screenshot we've just saved

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,570
you about five to ten minutes and 300

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,920
cursors next we just save it it's a

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,140
version controlled we push a commit

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,940
message and there it is we can see we

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,700
have full version control in revision

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,780
history inside the tool next we have

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,730
something that you're going to love it's

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,020
called collections instead of saving

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,690
your files in separate folders a

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,190
separate repo so there's one repo on the

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,410
left you have all the existing content

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,820
on the right is the table of contents of

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,070
the documentation or the package you're

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,380
creating think of it as these books that

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,850
we used to do in our case you create

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,290
your documentation you just drag and

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,140
drop the topics that you want to put

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,850
inside of this collection what I love

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,110
about this in managing teams we can see

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,820
where that collections been published

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,830
how many people have read it full

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,660
analytics suite behind it and the

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,900
coolest bit with one-click

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,670
forget Jekyll this is real time so in

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,800
about three seconds we've live published

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,600
all of that documentation suite directly

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,250
to Kirill is onboard our knowledgebase

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,209
and documentation portal oh yeah and you

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,930
can see that we were on proto-punk

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,670
recently

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,830
so let's actually take a step back to

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,120
appreciate what we've just done we've

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,650
got three elements here we've got a

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,080
writing interface that lets your team's

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,550
distributed globally come together and

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,440
write in the single instance together

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,030
we've got a full management platform

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,310
that allows your team to come together

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,840
and put the em back into CMS it gives

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,209
you a way to take your existing content

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,860
search for it reuse it and make the best

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,300
value of the content you very paid to

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,280
create and we've got an inbuilt

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,810
publishing platform you can export it by

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,940
our API stew any format or any

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,669
destination you want or use our internal

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,020
documentation portal now this is kind of

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,790
cool because this isn't the first time

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,740
we've done this any Red Hat is in the

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,060
room

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,770
none they're all having the free lunch

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,900
so I used to work for a company called

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,520
Red Hat and this is like family to us

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,050
and while at Red Hat we created

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,640
something called press-gang we thought

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,470
of it as an internal startup we're

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,390
solving our own challenge of how can we

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,620
as a distributed team more efficiently

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,480
and more effectively create software

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,910
documentation and collaborate with the

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,890
developers whilst doing that we took

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,360
over about 2/3 of Red Hat's global

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,950
software documentation teams in our

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,270
first year and we started to get

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,880
feedback from the external community

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,470
that this is great but it's very hard

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,210
for our teams to let us to install

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,130
software documentation tools on our

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,260
server can you just maybe let us use a

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,300
credit card can we have a SAS product so

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,040
we joined a startup accelerator in Paris

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,260
France called Numa as a part of the

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,430
textiles family and in that experience

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,140
we learned that there's a massive shift

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,030
happening in our industry we're no

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,500
longer using XML file formats are moving

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,650
to markdown we're no longer making

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,820
things via command-line and compiling

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,890
laborious infor there's any Red Hat crew

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,460
from my old team laborious methods of

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,830
shipping documentation so we're a SAS

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,300
company we listened to our customers we

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,010
went through the process of leaving Red

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,390
Hat becoming a startup doing all the

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,010
hard things of learning how to get up on

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,169
our feet and we came up with this model

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,110
so we have a monthly model for three

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,630
sets of teams at the $25 a month range

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,280
this enables small the medium teams to

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,410
basically use that workflow that we

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,000
introduced about $45 a month we

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,770
introduced custom domains custom

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,020
branding all the things that a medium to

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,070
large-sized team would use and 95 in

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,280
upwards is when we tack on the

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,910
enterprise market so we tackle this in

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,100
three phases

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,990
initially the phase one was to target

00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,669
where our expertise was what other

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,680
Technic riders what are the teams out

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,390
there like our team at red heart existed

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,040
and this is a space that we're quite

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,230
well known within we have a lot of

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,630
experience within we moved into Phase

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,340
two recently we shipped our MVP we

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,050
started onboard customers and we're

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,430
noticing something very interesting so

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,930
interesting that I've relocated from

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,730
Australia and now live in the San

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,470
Francisco Bay Area just to see this

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,390
thing happening time and time again that

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,160
our existing users when we meet them

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,260
bring their marketing teams and they

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,030
develop advocacy teams in to say we're

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,220
using this product - can you show us can

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,540
you add these new features phase 3 will

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,669
be very interesting for us how to

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,560
increase our ACV how to increase the

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,450
revenue from existing customers by

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,629
getting larger in the enterprise realm

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,550
what they called land and expand

00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,810
so in terms of traction we have over a

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,090
thousand teams in over 80 countries

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,919
currently using korilla a team can vary

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,750
between two people in an open-source

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,470
project and I should add open-source is

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,750
free for life

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,819
the police jump in and those teams can

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,889
also go up to you name at any number

00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,659
what's also kind of fun if anyone here

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,520
knows product hunts we were surprised by

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:01,349
our service getting absolutely smashed

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,060
not too long ago we had to do the

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,319
all-night product hunt thing and I was

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,060
very surprised for a documentation

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,409
product to realize that we're actually

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,419
one of the most popular products that

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,250
day so we made the the short list of hot

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,340
products which again for a documentation

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,050
product is pretty surprising um in terms

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,819
of a team as you might imagine there's a

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,500
whole heap of us X Red Hat is in there

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,840
we love the support we have from our

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,190
community we've decided to refocus our

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,719
attitude rather than just being a bunch

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,810
of technical writers we've become very

00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:30,240
heavily obsessive about UX and UI think

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,300
of us is like what Trello was - JIRA we

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,979
are - confluence and that is korilla

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,169
collaborative documentation for software

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,100
teams jump on korilla comm today and I'd

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:45,989
love to hear your feedback thank you

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,989
[Applause]

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,850
so thank you great presentation so I

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,490
guess you used to beep all games team

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,490
right yeah yeah way back when so quick

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,350
question of the 12,000 people teams you

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,340
you refer to earlier that's using your

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:08,330
product how big is the biggest team

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,490
we've had a team of 60 just for sake of

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,690
not being too public some of the names

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,340
and we had a large team that has

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,050
something to do with rocket ships that

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,539
jumped in we we learned at the time that

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,940
we weren't an able to capable to serve

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,590
that larger user base so we started to

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,910
move back down market into the smaller

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,539
software teams that you might find

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,180
around the Bay Area in the startup space

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:30,560
gotcha how many pay customers you have

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,810
interesting so we launched the various

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,310
pricing so we used a series of tests to

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,289
split test different pricing friction

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,360
and on the site we've always displayed

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,250
certain pricing variations and usually

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,930
how we get our high NPS is I usually

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,940
jump in in the trial period and we roll

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,529
them across onto freemium what we have

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,940
done is we've really surprised that some

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,410
of the teams especially in San Francisco

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,610
demanded that they keep paying because

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,560
they managed to convince their boss to

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,810
pull the credit card out so we have

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,540
around 20 paying customers in various

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,860
spaces and for a freemium company we

00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,810
found that interesting because we're

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,459
saying this is actually free we'd like

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,930
you to use this but we're very surprised

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,700
that people actually wanted to to keep

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,589
the credit card rolling that's great and

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,480
the final question is of your 12,000

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,800
teams I bet some of them probably use it

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,250
for a period of time and then just leave

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,410
it behind shelfware what cost that yeah

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,610
that's really been interesting um we had

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,700
to struggle with this at first we were

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,170
very strict with monthly active users

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,620
then we found out that that wasn't such

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,120
a bad thing

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,529
teams would come in before a software

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,850
release cycle similar to what we used to

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,010
do at Red Hat once or twice a year

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,600
there'd be a big burst of activity we

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,820
get a lot of support requests then they

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,870
chip their documentation then go idle so

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,190
we were worrying about our monthly

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,600
active users and recessing because

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,400
obviously being in the bay we wanted to

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,080
speak to VCS eventually and have great

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,790
numbers then realize what a boon it was

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,529
to actually have this this spike in

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,029
these trends so the challenge became

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,680
more about instead of just addressing

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,360
churn was addressing additional value

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
and saying how can we is there a value

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,180
for you to keep active in this or should

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,440
we just leave you alone which is one of

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,100
the interesting challenges as we come

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,410
out of the MVP

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,090
I think is it is it actually useful to

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,020
keep you collaborating and active or is

00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,280
this enough that you've actually

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:05,120
published your content and you're

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,350
satisfied I didn't quite understand your

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,900
pricing slide but you're definitely not

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,330
charging enough that I'm sure of

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,800
I wanted to talk a little bit about how

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,960
you see the competitive landscape

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
because I imagine a lot of people are

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,520
building stuff in-house a lot of people

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,550
are turning to a more traditional less

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,950
documentation centric CMS tools you have

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,480
that really neat trick with a quick

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,880
screenshot and I'm sure there's some

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,180
great stuff for code snippets walk me

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,040
through what you see is that sort of

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,890
wedge of differentiation that's highly

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,410
relevant to the documentation staff and

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,090
then help me understand particularly as

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,880
you go to software teams or marketing

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,620
teams with the platform how relevant

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,420
that stuff is that's a great question is

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,910
actually some of my favorite areas our

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,930
biggest learnings so the greater sense

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,820
of value was something that we

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,010
experienced at Red Hat so we were

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,290
shipping something called EA p6 we're

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,520
refactoring the entire product our team

00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,960
was spread around the world so we needed

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,820
a way to have all of our writers using

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,110
the one interface and in fact not just

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,420
different versions but the exact same

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,220
live experience and give them a way to

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,110
publish through that what we found

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,670
interesting in that process was other

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,960
teams started to move in say the

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,730
marketing teams would see the way we

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,260
version control and having all your

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,570
marketing assets version controlled was

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,430
not a planned instance in the beginning

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,470
as that start to rolled out we realize

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,380
there's a larger collaborative play in

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,240
there in terms of pricing was that your

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,500
your first part pricing has been really

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,960
interesting and we're definitely coming

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,150
in under market which for a bootstrap

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,220
team with a little bit of angel has been

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,080
quite an interesting prospect but in

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,460
terms of competition again being in the

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,930
Bay Area we had something funny happen

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,370
where I was sitting with the team and

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,690
they brought their developer in and the

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,090
developer actually had built his own

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,950
instance using get books using jackal

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,150
and while we're sitting there talking I

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,650
just asked one question it was a little

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,830
bit rude I said can you tell me like

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,500
what's your wage means wage is about

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:56,420
160,000 us cheap for the bear in cheap

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,710
to the Bay Area exactly and I couldn't

00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,120
help at us and say can you tell me how

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,040
many hours a week you think you're

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,320
actually configuring this documentation

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,980
portal that the things we've bundled for

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,290
$45 a month if it's

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,029
than 1 hour a week then why not just

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,139
move to a SAS provider like this and

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,880
that's actually become our sales pitch

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,769
as we come in and we're quite well-known

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,300
just in that first go to market segment

00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,220
where people say look we're tired of

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,649
doing Excel selves we like doing it devs

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,910
love making dev tools but the problem is

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:25,699
saying oh that's very expensive

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,699
especially in the US great thanks Norris

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:33,240
what happens when a customer stops

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,220
paying is it like Apple music where goes

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,290
away anything you've downloaded and

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,480
because it seems like they own that I

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,920
mean that's their that's a good question

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,680
you know the trick about that question

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,779
is now people know because we've

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,089
actually debated this a lot is what do

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,230
we do in there's there's as UX designers

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,029
we're very big on patterns what are the

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,920
usability patterns that exist and we

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,860
chose to be as generous as possible

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,389
so as how we got over those thousand

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,339
teams some teams came in and wanted to

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,810
shown away even from freemium or some of

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,490
the early paying ones and we basically

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,470
said well your documentation will stay

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,269
because your Docs has the powered by

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,470
Carillo down the bottom so that actually

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,329
has a marketing value for us for the

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,130
time being and I think I'm looking at

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:12,990
something like the slack model where if

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,970
a user is inactive on slack they

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,319
prorated the cost back to you and we

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,029
thought that's how we want to tip a file

00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,740
company we come from Red Hat there's a

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,660
certain culture we represent and as long

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,889
as that we can pay our bills and we're

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,329
talking the majority of our bills of

00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,610
storage which is a race to the bottom

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,319
these days with Amazon and Google cloud

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,790
that we decide actually let's make our

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,649
point a difference customer service and

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,540
obsess about making sure that experience

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,829
is joyous so if you use korilla for a

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,690
while you pay for a few months and you

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:41,730
turn off your documentation will remain

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:44,060
there at least for the time being so if

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,980
the core value proposition is around

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:52,019
technical publication and documentation

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:54,350
of software what's that I mean I can

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,569
understand how making that easier is

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,760
intuitive right but what's the value of

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,860
that market today what are what is the

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,680
market that you've chosen spending on

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,260
that and and you know what does that say

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,209
about your opportunity if you were you

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,610
know if you were X percent cheaper than

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,430
the leader today given that you're doing

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,800
aggressive pricing in a freemium model

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,959
what's that leave for you to take

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,399
manager that question used to keep me

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,110
awake every single night during our

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,209
accelerator program and there's a really

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,769
good one what we felt was in the first

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,330
phase of the company building the MVP

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,980
getting the prototype up and running and

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,529
getting some paying customers to prove

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,120
the validation we felt that in this

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,430
phase we would learn the insights that

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,540
would let us tackle the next step and

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,190
thankfully that happened so when we

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,290
started to sit down and I'd have lunch

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,579
with the team say I basically live in

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,050
South Park and all our customers are

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,040
sitting around there and we'd have lunch

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,839
with them and the marking team would

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,339
write up say hey can you show us how how

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,839
your images are so easy to copy and

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,850
paste that saves us like literally an

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,560
hour a week and we started thinking okay

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,019
this is interesting the opportunity is

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,089
there so as I say that the phase one is

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,440
just just maximizing the narrow niche

00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,360
that we have we thought we want to focus

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,890
on an area that there's very few teams

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,450
that have the expertise we have as

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,550
technical writers we're seeing some

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,950
companies competitors only focus on that

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,660
space where I'm seeing like a tee action

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,220
happening the land and expand is once

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,170
we're in there we're seeing developer

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,269
advocacy teams growing now I like that

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,709
one is a far greater total addressable

00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,060
market because the number one thing

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,800
growing in the universe right now is

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,560
that total headcount of developers and

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,750
as I said if 80% of those complain that

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,130
80% are forced to use the documentation

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,360
to learn how to code and that's the

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,740
number one growing thing then that's

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,839
definitely good space to be in front of

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,520
if we can improve the ability for them

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,560
to loan to create documentation together

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,839
then that itself is that serviceable

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,480
market becomes tangible then as we go up

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,860
market to enterprise now startup some

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,930
meant to be a little bit of bravado I

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,610
like to be realistic at that phase we

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,529
know as we learn phase 2 will loan

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,880
Enterprise after that we don't want to

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,290
promise the world in this space but

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,850
we're very confident as we move out of

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,470
the technical writing space that we know

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,270
enough about that growth pattern that

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,640
expands organically that we really want

00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:01,610
to dominate the land and expand last

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,740
question I'll just make a comment if

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,930
you're at the point where you're you are

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,890
securing revenue and you also have

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:12,529
investors it seems like if someone stops

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,810
paying there ought to be some pain I

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:19,130
mean they can have the data but maybe

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,600
find something that that they want so

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,339
that they keep paying from from a

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,320
retention standpoint you don't lose the

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,060
customer if I can just a quick comment

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,279
in that um we do think very heavily

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,300
about stickiness what we've seen is the

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,040
existing products the end

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
yes ratings are terrible so there's this

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,830
to markets happening here there's the

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,270
existing and I'm sorry if anyone's from

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,050
Adobe I'm about to rubbish your product

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,790
frame-maker

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,170
I can say publicly it's terrible as a

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,180
technical writer I've been forced to use

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,010
that my whole life NPS is in the rubbish

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,450
bin so when you see people like us and

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,560
some of the other startups coming

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,960
through in our space we're all motivated

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,970
by the experience in the UX and as we

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,070
start to bolt on analytics grammar

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,480
checkers collaboration tools machine

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,520
learning to analyze patterns in your

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,130
publishing those things become sticky

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,870
and I'd rather bind us to our roadmap

00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,880
and our ability to ship things that make

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,770
lives better then to lock you in Oracle

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,480
s can say screw you have to pay or we

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,620
kill your docks I want to be in that

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,589
business not that business something if

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,750
you have investors because they they

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,550
want to return at some point luckily you

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,160
stay in bootstrap it on your own you can

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,900
do whatever you want okay the investor

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,400
conversations one we can have off likes

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,890
is a very interesting space but thank

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,750
you for your feedback all right David

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,730
thank you very much

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,730
