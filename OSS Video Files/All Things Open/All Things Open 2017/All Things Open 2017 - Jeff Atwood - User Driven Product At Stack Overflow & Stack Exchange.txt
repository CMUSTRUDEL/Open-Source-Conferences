okay I'm gonna go ahead and get started

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,509
thanks for coming everybody I apologize

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,280
the name of this session actually turns

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,200
out to be a little wrong and actually

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,540
kind of backwards so this is gonna be

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,580
more about driving users with product

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,730
design it's a little bit of both

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,960
but I'll explain as we proceed so if you

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,240
don't know who I am I introduced myself

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,640
in the keynote but I had a I had this

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,480
blog coding horror which I've run since

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,420
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,880
I still sporadically write and I'm

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,710
co-founder of Stack Overflow which is a

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,149
Q&A site for programmers which you're

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,140
probably familiar with so this talk

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,660
isn't gonna be about those two things

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
this is gonna drill pretty deeply into

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,180
my current project which is discourse

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,829
and I was very excited to get the word

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,989
discourse as our name because first of

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,520
all naming is very difficult you've

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,980
probably heard the old joke there's two

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,199
hard things in computer science cache

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,059
and validation naming and off-by-one

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,129
errors so I was happy to get the name

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,710
that kind of made sense but it's also

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,210
kind of a fancy name like you'll see the

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,710
word discourse come up I get excited

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,390
because when I read news articles we're

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,979
talking about discussions like they'll

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,900
use this word I'm like yes that's the

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,390
word that's that's why I started this

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,490
project is how can we have actual

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,409
discourse with other humans without it

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,560
breaking down into like the howling of

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,729
wolves and that is why the actual name

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,189
of our company is civilized discourse

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,740
construction kit incorporated in other

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,049
words I want to give you software that

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,810
lets you have civilized discussions with

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,829
other humans so this is the somewhat the

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,570
soft work and it looks like this is our

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,100
homepage and you know there's a lot of

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,970
sort of hand-wringing that goes on

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,640
around you know what's happening right

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,799
there's a lot of polarization but

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,780
there's a lot of fun opportunities to

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,250
for the stored discourse to appear and

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,570
these are the kind of problems that I

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,890
was trying to address when I started

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,810
this course like I want online

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,880
environments where people aren't telling

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,340
me don't read the comments I was like

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,049
well the comments are the people right

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,670
like I mean what's is there something

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,890
wrong with people that we don't want to

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,569
read what they're writing like I feel

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,790
like this is a software problem the

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,349
software should be able to help us have

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,950
discussions where people aren't going no

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,780
no don't read the

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,739
comments he'll just you know end up not

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,739
wanting to be part of the human race

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,830
anymore so this is also very timely

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,209
because when I started in 2012 we didn't

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,810
have the current political situation but

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:30,030
it's become deeply polarized to a degree

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,580
that I think nobody anticipated in the

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,930
world and you know there's this other

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,220
ring that goes on of people where it's

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,110
like these people believe a different

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,730
thing than me and you know they're

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,140
essentially the devil right like we have

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,599
nothing in common or they're not even

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,549
human right like we've gotten to such a

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,830
weird place in public discourse that

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,900
like I'm happy that I started on this

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,989
but it also it's very daunting problem

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,420
to take on in software but those are fun

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,980
problems because I feel like software is

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,329
people at some level right like that's

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,660
what's interesting about software is

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,069
that it helps you you know become a

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,150
better person as I mentioned in my

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,220
keynote that's kind of the ultimate goal

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,569
this is one of my favorite quotes Marc

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,739
Andreessen eventually deleted his

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,840
Twitter accounts this is not there

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,060
anymore but I love this statement

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,980
because it does emphasize that you know

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,790
this the people who do software kind of

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,980
want everything like everybody carries a

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,230
supercomputer in their pocket with them

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,540
on their person almost every waking

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,730
moment now this is a world I would never

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,829
have envisioned as like a young week and

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,810
we're kind of like the dog that caught

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,940
the bus like we don't really know what

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,019
to do with what we have I mean a lot of

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,670
the news that's currently happening

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,609
around Facebook or on the election

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,319
around Twitter it's kind of like the dog

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,569
they caught the bus right we have this

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,180
situation where everybody's interacting

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,060
software like every possible moment but

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,739
is the software really helping them do

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,600
what they need to do is the software

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,060
like helping them make good choices as

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,040
humans and I would argue kind of no it's

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,120
not and that's kind of what I was trying

00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,859
to get into with this course is like how

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,519
can the software help us make better

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,410
choices so you know that's the good news

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,510
we're infinitely connected in ways we

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,400
never would have anticipated ten even

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,260
ten years ago right like this idea that

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,530
any given moment you could contact

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,359
someone instantly having nearly instant

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,299
responses is kind of nuts right like

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,229
over like chat software so that's the

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,849
good news is that we're infinitely

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,150
connected but that's also kind of the

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,409
bad news because you're gonna find out

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,360
things about people that you didn't

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:31,050
maybe want to know

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,360
and that you shouldn't have known so

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,449
getting back to discourse when we when I

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,800
sat down to design discourse I one of

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,630
the frustrations for me with forum

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,610
software was that it spends so much time

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,930
on just stupid stuff I don't care about

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,490
like here's how you make something bold

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,660
you know here's how you make a post

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,160
here's how your reply to a post it's

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,110
like those aren't the hard problems in

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,850
forum software the hard problems on

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,169
forum software are why is this person

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,270
trolling me where are these people

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,250
yelling at me why won't anyone come here

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,380
those are the hard problems in forum

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,580
software not how do I make a thread

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,050
right or how do I put it in the right

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,430
category so they're worried about

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,990
completely the wrong problems they're

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,840
worried about mechanical software

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,550
problems that are really simple and the

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,020
people problems are deep and hard and

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,550
that's where it's really interesting to

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,130
me like that's what I wanted to spend

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,350
time on is you know how do you get

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,510
software to teach you to get along with

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,160
people because that's the goal isn't it

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,780
that's what we're all here to do we're

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,669
not really here to make things bold

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,949
we're here to kind of figure out how to

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,570
get along with each other so the first

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,850
step on the road to figuring out like

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,950
how to get people to get along together

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,050
is of course rules right and programmers

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,419
love rules that's what the computer is

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,190
is a giant system of rules that execute

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,050
constantly right so all we need is a

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,729
good set of rules if we just had a good

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,160
set of rules everybody could get along

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,720
together so here's a picture of a set of

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
rules this is a picture I actually took

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,169
it's a McDonald's that's close to where

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,960
I live and it's interesting because

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,430
everything on this list if you look at

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,139
the list it has what I call the no

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,389
elephants rule which everything on this

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,090
list is is probably there because that

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,039
happened before and it was a problem so

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,440
it was a reactive rule somebody brought

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,789
an elephant you're like dude don't bring

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,590
any elephants right so now we have a

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,500
rule please stop bringing all your

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,880
elephants to McDonald's right so every

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,979
rule that's there is kind of their

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,200
reactively it's not really an

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,340
inspirational s it's like just you know

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,870
a list of things you should do and

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,450
nobody would really eject to these rules

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,919
these are simple clear rules and yet at

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,020
the same time when you go to McDonald's

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,030
pretty well understood commercial

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,710
interaction they still have to print the

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,889
rules because some people are gonna run

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,599
afoul of these very very simple rules so

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,550
we have that a discourse we spent a lot

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,550
of time when we launched the project

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,070
saying look let's have a simple like not

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,740
too long list of like just

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,570
things you can do to have you know

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,010
positive constructive interactions with

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,660
other people and discussion right and

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,490
it's a great great list it's like maybe

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,320
I don't know six seven paragraphs it's

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,570
not really long but then you have the

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,280
challenge of like okay we have rules but

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,050
how many people actually read this right

00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,670
like you know like they come to your

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,200
site they're not really there to read

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,600
about your rules they're there to do

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,700
something so they don't care about your

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,960
rules so you got to think from a

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,670
software perspective how can I get

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,860
people to at least look at this and

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,090
acknowledge it and to be fair maybe they

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,470
saw it somewhere else maybe they've seen

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,330
the discourse rulesets like okay I

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,890
already know this because I've been to

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,380
five other discourse sites and the rules

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,060
are always the same so one way you can

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,250
do is we have a badge right if you

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,930
actually read the rules now I can't

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,760
guarantee you read them you scroll to

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,170
the bottom of the rules let's say you

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,820
get a badge for that now there's a bunch

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,260
of other badges you can get but this is

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,790
a way to encourage the right behavior

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,020
which is at least hey did you even look

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,230
at the rules that we have before you

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,640
came here the other thing we do is on

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,410
the hamburger menu where you can hide

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,270
all the other options in your software

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,010
we put a little indicator on the fact

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,480
which is the rules that indicates hey if

00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,820
you want to if you're the type of person

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,080
that likes to clear indicators which you

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,640
know I'm OCD so I like to clear

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,530
indicators then you can clear this

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,290
indicator by clicking here and read

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,120
about our rules so those are some ways

00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,110
to you know get people to at least look

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
at the rules but you got to acknowledge

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,910
the rules are not really the full

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,010
solution they're sort of a linchpin of

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,620
your strategy but they're not how it

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,840
gets done so here's an example of air

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,190
B&B like I had to something happened to

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,540
my Airbnb account I don't understand

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,750
what happened but I had to sign up for a

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,910
new Airbnb account and when I did at one

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,590
point in the sign up it basically said

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,870
okay look you're signing up for air if

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,910
you start forcing rules on people you're

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,820
gonna find some behaviors that you

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,440
didn't anticipate and some of it will we

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,520
need your rejection of the rules that

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,099
you're putting in front of them there's

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,479
a really great oatmeal on the backfire

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,280
effect so if you search for just go to

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,120
Google with that backfire effect oatmeal

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,680
and I love the oatmeal style of

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,390
narrative comic explanations so I

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,700
encourage you to read through that to

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,170
understand it also kind of tries to

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,120
explain what's going on in the United

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,860
States at this point at least some parts

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,440
of it so I think it's good to understand

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,780
the backfire effect now that said

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,670
you still want to have rules because if

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,290
you don't have any rules if you don't

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,240
have a list of like things that you

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,940
stand for then you don't stand for

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,570
anything okay and at that point anything

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,540
goes

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,340
so you still need the shining statue

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,930
like look these are our goals these are

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,150
the things that we believe in it's why

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,130
this conference has a you know code of

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,900
conduct right I mean hopefully you don't

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,850
have to enforce it but you need to have

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,620
it because it says this is what we

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,840
believe in it's the same reason people

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,190
get married and take public vows to stay

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,920
married even though sometimes they

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,480
probably don't they wanted to right you

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,740
have this lofty goal yes we will be

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,660
married for the rest of our lives maybe

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,430
it doesn't work out that's okay but you

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,340
still you want to have these lofty

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,620
aspirational goals because not having

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,380
lofty aspirational goals is just a dark

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,690
place to be in life now once you have

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,880
the rules then the question is okay well

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,010
how do you get people to follow the

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,570
rules right without nagging them without

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,610
like feeling people feeling they were

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,850
forced to follow the rules how do you do

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,870
this so there's a great book on this

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,310
it's called the honest truth about

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,400
dishonesty all of Danny Early's books

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,840
are really genius I highly recommend

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,430
this one one of the things you learn

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,020
from this book I'll spoil it for you see

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,840
don't you have to read it it's really

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,870
two things one is that if you want

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,370
people to be honest you have to remind

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,800
them to be honest at the time of

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,020
temptation okay at the time when they

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,970
see a tale with tons of money that's

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,220
just sitting there that is the point of

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,950
what you need to remind them hey do you

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,350
want to you know do you really want to

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,600
be considered a thief right so ethics

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,760
classes from ten years ago not effective

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
a bunch of policies they probably didn't

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,300
read not effective the only thing that

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,550
really works is reminding people at the

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,970
time of temptation to sort of again be

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,790
their better selves and there's another

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,050
subtlety to this so it's not just the

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,550
gist in time nudges that's really

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,750
critical and we do this a ton in

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,110
discourse I'll give you a bunch of

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,440
examples in a minute an interesting

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,570
study they did this is in England they

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,580
they had a big problem with stolen

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,510
bicycles bicycles getting stolen so what

00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,160
they did was they put up this sign

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,260
psycho thieves we were watching you with

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,180
a pair of male eyes and all they did was

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,980
literally put this sign up and they did

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,150
it at some locations and other locations

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,220
they didn't but if you look

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,930
patience where the sign was up there was

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,750
like a sixty-two percent reduction in

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,760
stolen bicycles all because of the sign

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,950
now you might say oh that's because they

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,600
saw the sign and they realized oh if if

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,760
I steal a bicycle I'll get in trouble

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,390
but it doesn't actually work that way in

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,730
dan Eyre Lee's book he defines the

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,350
reason people don't steal is not because

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,670
there's a rule against stealing they

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,710
don't give a crap about your rule

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,460
against stealing they do not want to

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,170
think of themselves as people who steal

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,360
that is critical to understanding the

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,670
lesson in the book and that's also why I

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,500
think this works people are reminded by

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,570
that signs of Koji's if I steal this

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,640
bike I'm a person who steals bicycles

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,290
from like somebody who needed that bike

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,430
right like or maybe they can't go to

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,100
work or maybe they can't go to class

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,560
right I'm kind of a bad person if I do

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,850
that and that's the reminder that you're

00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,830
actually giving them with a sign it's

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,540
not I will punish you because they don't

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,850
give a crap what they give a crap about

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,880
is themselves and how they think of

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,130
themselves so that's that's I think

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,510
really an interesting application of

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,050
this now when it comes to the internet

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,700
this is xkcd 386 to me the most classic

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,400
xkcd because I deal with this on an

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,090
ongoing basis as a person right somebody

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,830
is wrong on the Internet so this is the

00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,820
point of temptation right so that was

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,890
one of the key insights I had a

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,940
discourse it's you're reading a topic

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,230
you're reading something it doesn't

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,280
matter and you get to a point in the

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,620
topic you're like whoa whoa whoa whoa

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,020
whoa what you just said right there is

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,940
some BS right and I'm gonna tell you why

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,640
so this is the point that someone is

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,930
wrong in the Internet so what I do what

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,420
we do in discourse at that point is at

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,860
the moment you start typing we're like

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,640
okay now you're telling people that

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,530
they're wrong on the Internet you

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,590
started typing I'm about to tell you how

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,020
deeply wrong you are at that point I

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,510
want to remind you to be your better

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,690
self right are you just yelling at

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,250
people are you attacking a person versus

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,110
an idea it's okay to actually attack

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,260
ideas but it's not really cool to attack

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,280
people and are you actually improving

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,350
the conversation or you just here to

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,120
rant and rave or is this gonna be like

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,950
interesting right for other people to

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,470
read at some level like at least be

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,720
funny at some level so that's I think

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,150
one of the things we try to leverage in

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,040
discourse a lot is this idea of the

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,260
just-in-time like when is the

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,170
at which we can intervene in software

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,710
and remind people to do things that are

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,230
kind of in their best interest anyway

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:34,020
another example of this is the like

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,070
button so one of the goals I had in

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,760
discourse is I don't really want people

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,500
to type like yes no cool you know

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,510
one-word replies that's a chat system

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,800
we're not really a chat system maybe you

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,600
can kind of use it that way but it's not

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,630
really the intent I want people to type

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,340
sentences and ideally paragraphs if

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,630
you're up to it but at least a sentence

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,400
right like give me a sentence we're

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,890
having a conversation give me a complete

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,120
sentence that's like a thought right so

00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,880
how do you incentivize that well first

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,620
we suppress we won't let you post by

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,620
default in discourse if it's less than

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,760
15 characters and people hated that we

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,680
had a whole design issue where people

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,900
who are complaining constantly that I

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,430
have to take 15 characters oh god you

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,440
know how can you possibly make me type

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,450
15 characters when all I want to type is

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,860
guess exclamation point right and you

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,620
have to explain them over and over so

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,600
rather than doing that we added some

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,640
education look okay cool you just want

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,380
to say the word cool well we have a

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,790
button for that it's called you know the

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,290
like button for which for us is the

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,690
heart which is about empathy which I

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,610
talked about hey maybe you could push

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,950
that you know and then you're expressing

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,120
the sentiment without you know

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,250
cluttering the discussion with another

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,600
reply that's just the word cool right so

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,890
that's another way to sort of step in at

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,870
the motive temptation I want to post a

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,850
really short reply what do you really do

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,680
you really want to post just one word in

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,540
a discussion like does that add to

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,950
discussion so ideally you start thinking

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,230
about the stuff with these little nudges

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,240
that we're giving you about the software

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,220
right and about improving discussions

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,090
between people another thing that I put

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,930
in and I actually put this in for me I

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,360
found that one thing I would do in

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,130
discussions is I would sort of find one

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,560
person and essentially argue with that

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,180
person you know like I would be in a

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,260
conversation and there's I don't know 10

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,940
people in conversation but I'm just

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,800
focusing on that one person I'm just

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,930
replying replying applying to that one

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,460
person so I wanted to add something in

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,260
discourse and I don't think my copy here

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,090
is particularly good I need to talk to

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,560
Seth Godin and get something good here

00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,850
but what I want people to do is realize

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,160
like you know don't be that person

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,160
that's sort of haranguing another person

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,690
like it just a good conversation is full

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,340
of diverse voices

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,930
and when you're applying the same person

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,610
three four or five times in a row is

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,780
that really adding the conversation or

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,290
is that like two people sort of

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,880
bickering with each other right and

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,770
there's a lot of places you can do this

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,650
you can think okay think of situations

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,480
and again this is a lot about me like I

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,890
I want to be better at this stuff like I

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,050
don't want to be the guy who argues with

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,160
people all the time I don't want to be

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,470
the person that's making a discussion

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,630
worse I want to learn to do this better

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,790
and I want the software to help everyone

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,000
learn to do this better so some other

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,140
scenarios where this is helpful is if

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,220
you're posting a link that's already

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,290
been posted earlier in the discussion

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,420
well gently say hey that's a cool link

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,100
but you know Joe already posted it two

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,900
days ago are you sure you want to post

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,370
another link to this thing because it

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,200
kind of implies you didn't really read

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,700
the conversation if you're posting a

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,090
duplicate link I mean you might have a

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,830
valid reason but that's one reason not

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,480
to do that or if you're just replying to

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,940
the same topic over and over like you go

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,230
to a site unless it's like a

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,210
single-serving site where all they do is

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,220
discuss that one topic and you're only

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,600
replying to one topic well maybe there's

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,730
other things you could discuss there

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,490
with people right like are you sort of a

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,580
one-issue person are you here to give us

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,470
like talking points so I think there's a

00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,570
lot of opportunities to intervene and

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,810
think about like again the gist and time

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,490
when the exact thing is happening how

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,130
can the software step in and sort of

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,590
help them adapt that behavior and they

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,150
can be the person they want to be rather

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:03,090
than the person that their emotions are

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,180
kind of making them be at that moment so

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,130
I really I'm a huge fan of this example

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,959
so there's this this site called next

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,020
door it's essentially Facebook for

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,130
neighborhoods so the idea is that

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,630
everybody on your street would be a part

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,939
of this network and you would go on it's

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,260
like oh this is the Elm Street group

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,050
right and we all talk about things on

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,420
Elm Street and so that's what next-door

00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,100
is essentially so my wife had actually

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,300
joined next door and one of the things

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,040
she remarked to me is like man she's

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,530
like our neighbors are like super racist

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,700
and I was like what are you talking

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,050
about she said man they just going next

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,420
door and they're just posting like super

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,900
racist stuff I was like well that's kind

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,180
of weird

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,150
so next door realized they had a problem

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,740
with with sort of casual racism in this

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,290
way and it's usually in the form of a

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,150
crime report so what you would want from

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,100
a crime report is like oh I saw a bad

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,370
I break into a car and steal car not I

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,380
saw a person of a color that I'm not

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,500
familiar with on my street and that made

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,240
me think there was crime going on so so

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,060
the question really asking is can

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,700
software help you be less racist without

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,680
saying please be less racist so they did

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,540
this in an amazing way first of all when

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,130
you start with a crime report there's

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,600
this you know EULA we talked about okay

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,370
click and now you get the you love like

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,420
here's some things we're gonna tell you

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,880
before we let you do this

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,350
you know focus on the behavior

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,450
descriptions of hair not just the skin

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,010
color all the identifying parts of that

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,170
person their clothes their height all

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,300
that stuff and also please don't be a

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,490
racist right but here's the brilliant

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,730
part when you start doing the crime

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:36,360
report they require specific things

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,490
about that person you cannot put I just

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,260
saw a brown person on my street you have

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,120
to put I saw a person wearing this hat

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,760
these shoes of this height of this age

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,620
and they're actually teaching you to

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,990
make a better crime report any police

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,210
person would tell you a good crime

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,650
report a good like you know incident

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,630
report is gonna have all the identifying

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,850
features of the person not just race

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,140
that's not a good crime report so the

00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,580
beauty of this is you're not saying

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,740
please don't be racist you're saying

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,010
you're saying please make a good crime

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,740
report and along the way maybe we can

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,360
teach you to be a little less racist so

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,340
you know that I thought was amazing and

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,110
this is I think in the modern era this

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,300
is what software should be doing it

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,010
should be teaching people how to be

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,500
better people not like you know how to

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,980
deal with the software there's this

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,630
other great book called nudge so the

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,160
just-in-time reminders are great like at

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,960
the time the specific thing is happening

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,670
you jump in with just the advice they

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,680
would need specific to that time

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,260
there's also gentle nudges you can give

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,120
like all the time and an example of that

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,740
it's kind of the opposite of every

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,440
supermarket checkout Lane you've ever

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,240
seen where the junk food for kids should

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,790
be up high so they can't reach it as

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,130
easily and then the healthy food is at

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,630
eye level and like easy to reach so the

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,430
incur the thing you're doing here is

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,900
encouraging people say hey you can

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,970
choose the junk food but it's a little

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,830
bit harder it will be easier for you if

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,190
you just grab an apple right which is

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,320
right there at eye level so I think you

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,070
can also do this on software or what

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,780
you're saying is look

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,300
want to make the right thing easy to do

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,560
and I'm not gonna say you can't do the

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,780
wrong thing I'm not gonna say no you

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,580
can't have junk food but I'm gonna make

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,960
it more awkward for you like I'm gonna

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,390
put that in kind of an out-of-the-way

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,040
area that takes five steps instead of

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:22,230
the one step of the easy thing that I

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,400
that I really want you to do so the

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,510
other thing that's kind of scary about

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,450
this is I talked about our hyper

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,630
connectedness so when you go to next

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,640
door you know we how many interactions

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,770
with my neighbors do I really have on a

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,510
weekly or monthly basis I mean I might

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,750
see them in the driveway I might see

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,550
them on the sidewalk and say hi you know

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,770
but when would I have the opportunity to

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,290
really learn their feelings and their

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:49,110
actual you know thoughts on you know

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,110
important issues of the day and that is

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,570
why Airbnb became kind of racist is

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,180
because we're all hyper connected now

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,340
when you were renting from if you sew

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,230
Airbnb the function of Airbnb is to find

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,090
a place to stay right so if you go to a

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,190
hotel a hotel is not gonna be racist

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,740
because that's bad for business and it's

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,060
also kind of legal on some level but

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,390
it's not illegal for your neighbor to be

00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,210
racist right I mean maybe it should be

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,260
but it's not so what you're finding out

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,760
is once you unlock all these

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,220
peer-to-peer connections all this hyper

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,290
connectedness you may not like what you

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,550
find out about some of the people that

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,350
you meet that you wouldn't have ever

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,030
known I would never have known this

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,800
stuff about my neighbors from just you

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,800
know months of waving from the driveway

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,760
so one thing that you see a lot on sites

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,600
and another I think great gentle nudge

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,070
and so many sites do this as you're on

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,090
the site for a while once you hang out

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,380
on the site for a while

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,700
you start giving a little bit more

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,050
nudges to people because they're clearly

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,920
interacting with the content like

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,170
they're reading it they're scrolling

00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,090
like discourse for example measures read

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,320
time like I can tell you exactly how

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,260
long everything was on your screen

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,030
because I because well the next slide

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,550
because reading is fundamental because

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,290
it's so critical to what we're doing but

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,880
as you hang out on a site and stay there

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,840
more it's okay to start nudging people's

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,220
like hey it looks like you're enjoying

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
this did you want to share this content

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,680
or do you want to sign up for our

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,480
newsletter I think that's a really good

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,330
pattern because you're doing it based on

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,740
a behavior you know the user is hanging

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,340
out there and actually starting to

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,409
interact with you

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,029
but reading if you think about

00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,320
discussions and like the high level of

00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:22,230
what I was trying to accomplish with

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,600
discourse any good discussion involves

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,860
just as much listening as talking I mean

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
right now I'm giving a presentation so

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,460
it's all me talking but if we're having

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,440
conversation I just never shut up is

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,909
that a good conversation for you was

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,679
that a good conversation for me I would

00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:36,150
argue no it's not there's a lot of

00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,010
reading and listening that needs to go

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,630
on and the sad thing about traditional

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,600
forum software is they got this so

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,580
deeply wrong every forum software I can

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,809
ever think of the first thing they show

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,820
next your name is like how many posts

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,710
did you make right like that's the thing

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,570
we're gonna incentivize the number next

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,250
to your name is like yeah it's my post

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,440
count and you want that to go up right

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,029
because big numbers are good and the

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,470
numbers next to your name so a big

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:01,020
number next to your name must mean

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,429
you're really good right so what are we

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,789
incentivizing we're incentivizing

00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,320
talking and that's the opposite of what

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,240
you want in a discussion you want to

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,640
incentivize listening and reading right

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,460
you want talking but in proportion to

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,960
the listening so that was a that was so

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,690
disturbing to me in software is like

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,549
just how wrong they got it was that this

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,230
was like accepted and we still have

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,760
people come discourse like I need I need

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,500
to show a post count next to the

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
username I'm like no you know you're not

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,820
gonna do that you're not gonna do that

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,559
now I'll explain to you why but um yeah

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,159
it's just scary how wrong they got that

00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:38,010
and not only that but you know the

00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,799
carpet-bombing of talking points has got

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,270
to stop right like I get that you know

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,770
everybody has strong feelings about

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,039
issues and there's certain

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:48,960
understandings of issues but like you've

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,120
got to really listen not just wait for

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,740
your turn to talk and it should be

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,140
really your story I don't think people

00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,760
want talking points they don't want like

00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,559
that they want your experience some of

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,110
those powerful interactions I've had in

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,399
this course have been like people who

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,309
with a very different background than

00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,690
mine telling me a story about their life

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,059
like Boeing Boeing for example has a

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,980
huge community of transgender people and

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,539
I didn't know anything about transgender

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,740
people and they were just talking about

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,649
stuff that happened to them in the

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,690
bathroom and I was like holy crap I had

00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:22,919
no idea the bathroom was so dangerous

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,840
for people you know that have gender

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,960
transitions like I just didn't know as a

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,570
white dude who just

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,919
the bathroom I had no idea so it was

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,019
really illuminating and that was their

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,549
story right it was them telling me what

00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,720
had happened to them it wasn't talking

00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:36,490
points like listen to this thing that

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,279
happened to me let me share this story

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,440
with you right and that kind of changed

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,590
my mind in a way that carpet-bombing

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,659
talking points would not so Ars Technica

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,119
did this really cool experiment

00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,399
I don't want year it was but they posted

00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,570
a an article about gun control so

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,769
already you're in controversial

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,869
territory right you're dealing with

00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:58,809
people are gonna have strong opinions on

00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,999
either side in paragraph seven it's in

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,879
the middle that little green circle they

00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:06,399
put the words in if you read this far

00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,999
please mention bananas in your comment

00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,220
below

00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:10,869
we're pretty sure ninety percent of the

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,999
respondents this story won't even read

00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:17,080
it first and then the comments start so

00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,279
you can see it starting here on this

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:26,249
page I'm going to scroll down so here's

00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:29,679
the comments still going still going and

00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:31,440
finally you have one person I mean how

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,629
many pages with I don't even know that

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,340
actually read you know paragraph seven

00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:37,869
of this article which said you know

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,379
mention bananas this article is kind of

00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,059
a test right so are people even reading

00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,710
the stuff that you're putting on the

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,999
page before they comment right they're

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,450
not they're taking their preconceived

00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:48,460
notions

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,409
maybe it'll read the title and then

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,879
they're just gonna start dropping

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:53,080
science on you whatever they view as

00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:54,399
science right there's gonna like here's

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,840
my opinion about this thing that I

00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,629
didn't even read but I'm just gonna tell

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,669
you some stuff right now so how do you

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:03,309
get people to actually read well first

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,740
of all I hate pagination like I feel

00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:07,899
like pagination is one of the worst

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,289
things we've come up with I mean maybe

00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:13,090
it made sense in like 1999 but this idea

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:13,869
that you gotta paginate content and then

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,879
when you scroll the bottom you click

00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,309
next page is immediate friction to

00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:19,779
reading if you want people to read make

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,269
it easy for them to read so when you

00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,950
scroll down you know stuff just keeps

00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,200
coming right you don't have to click

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,700
next page you just scroll Scroll scroll

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,409
and as you scroll you get more stuff

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,139
right that was built into discourse from

00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,029
day zero because I want people to read

00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,529
the stuff that is written here so the

00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,509
more barriers I can remove from their

00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:39,429
reading the the more they're gonna read

00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:41,379
statistically right

00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,179
now since we did this I noticed a lot of

00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:45,039
sites have started doing this YouTube

00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,690
has started Auto playing the next video

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,919
I'm sure you've seen this where you'll

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,749
play a video it's like YouTube's like

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,239
hey cool here's another video kind of

00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,529
like that one just BAM right and you're

00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,940
like whoa I didn't really sign up for

00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,599
that but hey it's kind of cool so I

00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,489
don't know

00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,950
and then news sites like this is a new

00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:01,779
site I think I was reading that first

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,769
circle and then I go so god I scroll to

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,080
the bottom of that article it's like

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:07,629
here's the next article here you go you

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,799
know enjoy and I didn't really pick that

00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:11,679
article but I was like okay whatever

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,330
right that's another way to do it just

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,889
start immediately feeding the next set

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,219
of content which may or may not even be

00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:20,679
related another cool thing you can do

00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:22,269
like if you want to if people post a

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,469
comment and you kind of want to know did

00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:25,029
you actually read the article

00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:26,799
well first you could test them you can

00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,879
put in the banana test right like did

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,099
you mention the word bananas then I

00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,749
actually read the article you could show

00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:34,179
the amount of time they actually read

00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:36,009
the source article steam does this for

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,330
reviews so if you're a paste posting a

00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,190
review of a steam game and you played it

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,049
10 minutes you're like this game sucks

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,029
and it says right next to that person's

00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:45,369
name ten minutes played it's like well

00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:46,719
what kind of opinion can you have in ten

00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:49,210
minutes of a game that's not really even

00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:50,559
enough to give it a chance or if it's

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,659
300 hours that might be kind of

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,509
disturbing right depending on the game I

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:56,950
don't know so one thing you could do is

00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,960
show like how long they actually read

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,609
the article when they post their comment

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,690
discourse does highlight new users

00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:03,309
because new users are kind of like

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,779
you're not sure about them yet so their

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:06,279
name is in grey but one thing you could

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,509
do we haven't done this yet a lot of

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,279
stuff we're still experimenting and

00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,099
still figuring out is you could show

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,320
read time of the topic the other thing

00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:16,779
you could do there's this startup civil

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,559
comments before you can leave a comment

00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:22,509
you have to rate other people's comments

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,450
so you put you post a comment you click

00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,589
Submit and then sort of a you know Lucy

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,989
with the football moments like okay and

00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:30,700
we can post your comment but first we

00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:33,339
you have to rate these other comments on

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,389
quality and civility and it's kind of a

00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:36,249
cool thing because you go through and

00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:38,349
you rate and then there's a twist you

00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:40,359
rate two comments and then you rate

00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,549
yourself which i think is brilliant

00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,249
right like I'll be like whoa now I'm

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:47,080
writing myself well how civil was I is

00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:50,529
this actually contributing conversation

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,009
it's a really neat design so you can do

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,009
stuff like that

00:28:53,579 --> 00:29:00,789
so we talked about just-in-time

00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,769
we talked about nudges and then there's

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:04,809
really basic level of reinforcement

00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:07,809
which I'll just get to the spoiler which

00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,609
is the basically dog training which is

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:13,809
you reward the behaviors that you want

00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:18,369
and you ignore everything else so I do

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:21,699
think that works there is one caveat to

00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:24,579
this which is I think some human

00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:25,959
behaviors can be so negative that I

00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:28,089
don't think they can really be ignored

00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:30,219
so what I like to do is what I call

00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,959
suppress and redirect where if you have

00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:34,059
a discretion a discussion that's really

00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,919
just going off the rails like it's just

00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,449
it's in a bad place right this

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,579
discussion is not going anywhere good

00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:42,069
you can kind of shuffle that discussion

00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:44,139
off into kind of a protected or a hidden

00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:46,419
area of your site so it's not like on

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:48,219
the main page anymore right there's the

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,139
thing I forget I think one forum

00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,059
sufferer calls it's sinking it's like

00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:53,409
the AAB opposite of bumping right when

00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,940
you bump a topic you reply and then it

00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:57,190
goes to the top will you sink a topic

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,769
that means replies no longer bump it

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,229
meaning it'll just tend to flow down the

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,879
list of time and does is no longer

00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:05,259
following the normal rules of physics

00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:06,609
and the discussion which is you reply

00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,949
and it goes back up to the top Bob's

00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:12,609
back up like something floating in the

00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:15,999
water so I do think you have to ignoring

00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:19,989
it's not really enough it depends on the

00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:21,719
the type of behavior so unrewarding

00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:24,459
behaviors you have to be really careful

00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:26,639
that you're actually rewarding the

00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:29,469
behavior that you think you're rewarding

00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:31,959
by that I mean every time you give

00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:34,569
someone a positive reward every time you

00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:37,539
you have a badge every time you put a

00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:40,209
number next to someone's name you need

00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:42,249
to think what if I was an insane person

00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:45,099
with an unlimited amount of time whose

00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:47,289
only goal in life was to get this number

00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:48,039
to go up what would I do and what would

00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,769
that look like

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,899
right because that is ultimately what's

00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:54,190
going to happen eventually and you need

00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:55,839
to plan for that it's what I call

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,669
designing for evil but it's not really

00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,559
just evil it's just people can be

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,989
incredibly motivated by numbers next to

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,879
their names and that can cause them to

00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:05,560
do things that are very surprising to

00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:08,620
you as a person

00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,110
building software so I think the

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,540
takeaway here is to put yourself in the

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,700
mindset of an attacker kind of with

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,530
every feature that you build how will

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,630
this feature be used against me

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:22,240
how will this feature be used against

00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,920
other people in this discussion and if

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,870
you can't come up with plausible answers

00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,230
for that you need to rethink what you're

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,230
doing

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,410
so other little tiny things that we do

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,120
in this course like one thing that

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,500
always bugged me was you're reading a

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,750
discussion and you want to start

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,550
replying so cool let me you know I know

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,520
you said this and let me reply to that I

00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:45,100
wanted replies to be organic in the

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,080
sense that you're you continue to reply

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,780
as you're reading like reading is so

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,210
important that I don't want replying to

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,360
take away a lot of old-school software

00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,490
when you click reply it teleports you to

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,530
like oh now you're in a reply mode you

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,230
can't read anymore you're just composing

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,700
your reply right now modern software

00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,500
doesn't do that so that problem is kind

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,650
of phone by the wayside but the the the

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,570
logic is sound you you want replies to

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,680
live alongside reading nothing should

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,270
interrupt your reading so you can see

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,010
here it's like an expandable panel I can

00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,500
bring it up I can put it down I can

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,090
reply and read at the same time because

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,340
that's how important reading is I don't

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,890
want anything to be in the way of that

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,840
so another positive reinforcement thing

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,780
is things users are gonna do anyway

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,700
which is like paste links there's this

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,230
standard called a Open Graph and Oh

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,230
embed which has become very common since

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,000
2012 it means any web site will have a

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,950
basic set of tags and an image so you

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,280
can like summarize a link so when

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,870
someone pastes a link into a discussion

00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,320
you grab that link and format the

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,790
content so you know the user basically

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,320
feels awesome it's like wow cool I

00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,610
posted a link and look how cool this

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,020
link is and I didn't have to do anything

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,790
I just pasted a link like I would

00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,440
normally I mean what is the web except

00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:59,020
for a bunch of shared links like to me

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,970
this is very essential critical behavior

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,800
for any web based thing it's like a link

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,440
right that's what we do we link things

00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,790
together so having that happen

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,730
one thing we actually added recently to

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:12,970
discourse is what we call a mini one box

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:15,190
where internal topics rather than the

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,450
raw link will put the title in there and

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,310
essentially construct that for you you

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,240
don't have to like rather than looking

00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,920
like a long URL

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,750
like the actual title the page that

00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,280
becomes automatically hyperlinked that's

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,429
in addition to the what you the one

00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:30,280
boxing slack calls this unfurling but

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,870
it's a great technique so the other

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,600
thing about discussions particularly

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,220
modern discussions is again discourse is

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,870
not chat and I spend a lot of time

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,550
explaining to people that you know

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,929
discourse is about structured discussion

00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,490
it doesn't have to be like super long

00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,200
discussion but the unit of work is

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,880
really the sentence it's not the word

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,610
like it is in chat where you like yep

00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,170
nope you know cool emoji that's that

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,520
slack that's chat system so that's not

00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,110
really what we do it's great it's

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,950
wonderful you need it but it's not what

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,809
we do it's a different it's

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,000
complementary to what we do so that

00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,980
being said people do expect sort of a

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,540
real-time almost

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,360
interaction with people at this point so

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,830
it has to be fast and it has to be

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,690
updating in real time so when we built

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,970
this course we built this message bus

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,250
technology so that when you're replying

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,389
and you get a reply like you'll see it

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,350
happen kind of in real time like if

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,730
you're reading a discussion and new

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,649
stuff comes in you'll see that happen

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,119
like you'll see new replies come in if

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,280
somebody edits or reply you'll see that

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,200
edit like res in in real time so it

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,060
feels very organic it feels like this is

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,159
not like a static web page that I have

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,109
to press refresh and you know I'll come

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,210
back in a few days it's like if you want

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:33,010
a real-time ish discussion we can give

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,419
that to you because sometimes that's

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,520
what discussions need they need to be

00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:39,580
rapid-fire they need to be going you

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,889
know pretty fast because it feels more

00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,230
like a dynamic like real discussion at

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,060
that point versus I send an email wait a

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,000
day for a response then you send an

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,119
email another day goes by right so we

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,139
wanted that real-time effect and some of

00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,540
the badging stuff that we're doing

00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,310
showing up is 90% of the job like I feel

00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,770
like this is true of parenting like

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,810
raising children is very very difficult

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,040
as I covered in my keynote there's a lot

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,530
of things you can do wrong but the good

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,240
news is 90% of the job really is just

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,770
showing up and being present for your

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,880
children not that you said the right

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,800
thing now that you did the right thing

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,600
because you probably won't but that you

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,550
were there right you didn't miss the

00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,410
thing right you were there with them and

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:20,950
I think that's also true of communities

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,320
people who show up consistently are kind

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,210
of the backbone of your community and we

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,369
actually have a streak badge now since I

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,990
put this slide together we have github

00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:30,730
does this stack overflow when I was

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,869
there we had this you know you get a

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,130
badge for being there 10

00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:35,349
days in a row you get a badge for being

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,720
there a hundred days in a row that kind

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:40,029
of stuff has been added and the more

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,009
you're there the more we trust you like

00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:43,839
the person who hangs out with us all the

00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:46,089
time we feel like we know that person

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,829
and you actually get an ambient increase

00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:50,589
in your trust level based on simple

00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:52,990
repeat participation even if you don't

00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:54,579
actually post you do have to read but as

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,799
long as you're reading and hanging out

00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:58,390
there will trust you more

00:35:55,799 --> 00:36:02,140
so obviously rewarding content I mean I

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,569
think this is you know bedrock stuff if

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,749
people are liking the the content that's

00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:09,759
posted you know special awards for that

00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:11,680
acknowledgments for that on the user's

00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:14,499
profile page we're gonna show off sort

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,569
of your best work right you'll notice

00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:22,990
here this person has visited 1,500 days

00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:24,819
in the discussion and you know we have

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:29,890
all these stats about like how much have

00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:31,569
you actually read so just to contrast

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,359
with this this was Stack Overflow for a

00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:36,700
minute so Stack Overflow we sort by

00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,710
reputation score so what you're seeing

00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,970
here is like the weekly reputation

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:45,549
scores for people the sorting here is

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,739
very important in discourse what we do

00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:51,609
it's not a system of competition it's a

00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:52,960
system of collaboration like competition

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,099
you know it's deco you want your answer

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,720
to be the best there could be more than

00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,400
one but you're still competing at some

00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,019
level but in this course you're

00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,759
collaborating so what you're seeing here

00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:03,759
is the ambient sort is now based on

00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:06,130
likes received but also likes given

00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:08,259
because you're not supposed to be

00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,640
drawing all the emotion out of the room

00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,170
you're supposed to be giving some of it

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,970
back right so what you're seeing here

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,220
we're not saying this but the sort says

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,869
it for us is oh look these people have

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,640
given as much as they have received

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,480
right and that's kind of the goal of the

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,859
committee when you go to the user

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,410
directory it's like that's the primary

00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,180
sort order is how much you've given and

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:29,040
almost how also how much you've received

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,420
so

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,150
my main pieces of advice for you know

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,310
driven user design you definitely need

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,350
aspirational guidelines not having a

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,090
list of things that you believe in means

00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,030
that you technically don't believe in

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,440
anything so you do need that but it's

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,480
not going to be as useful as you think

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,160
it's gonna be because it's all about how

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,690
do you get people to actually do those

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,950
things that's the hard part of this

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,620
coming up the rules is not the hard part

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,910
so for getting people to do it the

00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,130
just-in-time nudges and again I highly

00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,590
recommend the Dan early book the nudge

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,430
book there's a lot of places I want you

00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,500
to think when you're designing your

00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,660
software when is the moment in my

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,790
software where I can speak to the user

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,650
and give them really good advice about

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,400
what they maybe should do next right

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:16,680
that's the thing to think about and then

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,060
from a general design perspective the

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,830
things you want people to do that are

00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,550
positive make that like unbelievably

00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:25,530
easy to do and focus all your effort on

00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,810
just like creating this really simple

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,680
slide you know fall into the pit of

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:33,660
success and do the right things and and

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,430
focus on those so that they'll be easy

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,190
for people to do and then of course for

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:40,550
reward positive behaviors but also

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:43,770
suppress and redirect negative behaviors

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,540
that's a little more challenging but I

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,820
think those are the four things that

00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,350
I've learned from building discourse and

00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,080
you know hopefully they'll be useful to

00:38:49,350 --> 00:39:00,830
you as you build software and I think

00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:00,830
that's all I have for you thank you

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,890
do we do questions I guess we don't well

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,340
if you have questions come up and talk

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,810
to me I'm happy to do 101 I'm not in a

00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,830
hurry to leave so feel free to come up

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,830
