hello this is a one-hour talk in five

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,760
minutes so let's go go go I'm gonna be

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,710
talking to you about impostor syndrome

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,120
an individual competency but more

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,310
importantly I'm gonna be talking to you

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:20,189
about my slides not working at all not

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,109
even remotely there we go

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm gonna be talking to you about brains

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,670
I love brains I'm a former teacher and

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,730
the thing you need to remember about

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,920
brains is they're terrible these are wet

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,930
bags of meat inside a bone prison and

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,790
they give you everything you care about

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,129
that thing you're afraid of stupid meat

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,500
bag that thing you love stupid meat bag

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,739
and your stupid meat bag loves to learn

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,480
but it needs specific things the zone of

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,940
proximal development is an educational

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,559
concept saying if stuff's too easy for

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,360
you and you're working on it you can do

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,210
it you can do it alone but you won't

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,399
learn anything if stuff's too hard you

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,350
can dip up there with extra help but

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,510
you're not getting any learning done you

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,579
need to be in this absolute sweet spot

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,489
the zone of proximal development to

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,229
really learn and that's fantastic your

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,290
brain just needs to be right here to

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,850
learn that would be perfect except that

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,250
your brain is terrible at

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,040
self-assessment you need to know how

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,820
good you are your brain has no idea how

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,820
good you are because I'm lazy here's the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,689
Wikipedia definition of a cognitive bias

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,530
where did a talking about my

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,479
second-favorite cognitive bias but my

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,729
husband gave me a much better definition

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,640
it's when your brain takes garbage data

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,799
it male builds a terrible conclusion and

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,939
it falls in love with it because it made

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,890
it just for you

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,350
like a little kid with a macaroni

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,909
picture your brain loves this garbage it

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,310
made you imposter syndrome is my second

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,090
favorite cognitive bias and I define it

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,439
as this sick sad cold wet feeling that

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,030
you have no idea what you're doing

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,579
you're gonna get caught and it's all

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,149
gonna be terrible for me I don't know

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,579
what I'm doing

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,009
oh god my coworkers are gonna find out

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm gonna get fired I'll lose my flat

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,020
I'll have to live outside and because I

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,970
live in England it rains your process

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,329
may vary

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,730
what does imposter syndrome do I'm some

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,379
clamps back in 1978 studied high

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,959
achieving women and coined the term and

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,939
they found that imposter syndrome gave

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,260
people feelings of inadequacy and that's

00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,829
kind of in the definition we're fine

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,680
with that also you would avoid displays

00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:34,000
of target skills and they found that

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
people who suffered from it would use

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,349
social skills to get around that and

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,739
they will actually work harder in

00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,959
response to imposter syndrome who's

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,790
impacted by imposter syndrome your

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,530
options here are to raise your hands or

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,879
yell in 1 2 everybody quickly look

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,959
around it who does not have their hands

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,579
up this is great in two minutes of

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,069
course all of you who did this like just

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,659
just just fix it how do I fix it I want

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,159
to be able to fix impostor syndrome for

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,790
other people you're nice people you want

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,720
to fix it for other people first right

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,680
there's somebody right here who's like

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,510
no the first thing I would warn you is

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,180
never tell anyone they have impostor

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,829
syndrome this is so dangerous they can

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,989
be telling you I have a serious problem

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,000
there's a work culture fit people are

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,190
ignoring me a real skills gap if you

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,709
come up and say oh that's just impostor

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,609
syndrome I am NOT responsible for your

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,739
murder do give positive and meaningful

00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,449
feedback whenever you can who here

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,949
complains about something when it goes

00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,769
bad on an open-source project there's no

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,410
documentation y'all are lying or

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,030
super-nice who here says something

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,840
really nice when stuff works perfectly

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,730
oh maybe y'all are just really nice give

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,099
people positive meaningful feedback give

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,250
them the feedback their brain needs to

00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,870
know they're doing okay and this one's

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,209
not risk-free when you get a chance to

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,269
talk about your own fears talk about how

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:05,199
it doesn't always work for you fix it

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,569
for yourself assessment if your brain

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,090
doesn't know how good you are give it

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,760
the data say hey who here's taken a very

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,290
valuable industry certification who

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,290
here's taken an industry certification

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,670
they're not only super valuable but

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,620
giving your brain some feedback to say

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:27,840
hey we're 80% not crap is all right

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,120
you can also interrupt that ah feeling

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,280
for me it's I don't know what I'm doing

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,910
I'm gonna get caught I told my designer

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,450
what I actually do to de-stress and she

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,620
decided to draw that and that was fine

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,690
normal human being should not eat cake

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,420
in the bath I'm told I'm told people

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,220
play video games read a book go running

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,180
do the thing that interrupts that

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,690
horrible ah cycle then posture syndrome

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,070
you can't debug your brain but you can

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,890
give yourself the space and the

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,750
forgiveness to walk away and say this is

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,160
terrible but it's just a buggy error

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,440
message I'm fine everything's okay thank

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,300
you very much

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,300
