hello

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,000
I figure wake up the guys at this time

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,950
so hi my name is Gabe Ranga I came here

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,049
to talk you tell you about rocket chat I

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,580
think is the fastest growing open source

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,380
collaboration platform so I think nobody

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,970
can argue that one of the greatest

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,949
achievement of the Internet is the way

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,869
he connected all of us how easy was to

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,960
send a message to anyone

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,149
there's on the web and I think no one

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,739
can argue that the underlying technology

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,489
behind all this and most of this was

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,460
email or this newest email but email is

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,290
as old as the internet and I guess the

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,870
user experience is already showing its

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,030
age so it kind of created this vacuum

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,640
where all this app that were far too

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,340
familiar with came to be and started

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
creating this new interaction all the

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,850
collaboration tools slack whatsapp

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,699
messenger which at telegram but they

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,400
kind of forgot or they left behind the

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,920
beauty of the email like how open it was

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,810
how everybody would could own their own

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,030
data how they would connect to any other

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,909
server and it created all these silos

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,229
where the big value is because they hold

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,530
all the communication on their

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,990
infrastructure so that was born rocket

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,740
chat because we wanted to bring all this

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,799
new user experience all those new

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,570
features in a world where you don't need

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
to depend on those those organization so

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,570
we build it with three key

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,390
differentiators one we figured out all

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,180
the components of the the application

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,750
from the server side the client or even

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,670
a UI should be implementing them using a

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,860
structure that you could change or add

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,500
they implement your own channel types do

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,659
a whole branding of the UI at your own

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,790
BOTS but create also different types of

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,280
widgets guess once you have a channel of

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,990
your team on in and you have this

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,549
authentication and you streaming of

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,590
later you should be able to create

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,509
different message types need new types

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,220
of attachments new ways to react to

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,129
message there are new actions or

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,069
messages you could be able to customize

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,689
what data you want about each user

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,879
and all the other components should

00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:20,540
change regarding this so it's really

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,819
thinking if we start off with what those

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,709
tools that we already know as a starting

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,950
point how can we dream or like what else

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,780
could be built so we figured that like

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,670
being an open-source was just obvious

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,099
because all those ideas when you start

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,069
talking to other customers would be the

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,799
greatest product and also thought this

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,870
needed to be a decentralized as email is

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,700
we needed to be server spread everyone

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,579
can only Amir they can host on their

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,480
private cloud AWS so on but it needs to

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,049
be a decentralized application so the

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,239
idea really

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,909
I got attention we also were featuring

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,469
Rocky news product counts in a couple of

00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:01,280
months you could see Rockets had been

00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:03,590
used from presidential campaign from one

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,609
of the largest transport company in the

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,319
world by tuba and even the Brazilian

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,840
Space Agency they were using rocket jet

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,799
to discuss about the designs of the

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,470
Brazilian rockets

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:21,829
I got translated into almost 50

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,269
languages and our container was one of

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:26,720
the most downloaded containers for

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,180
business apps on the docker store even

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,680
annuity people all over the world using

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,949
rocket jet as an example how to do

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,659
devops chat ops and just as being away

00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:39,169
of so easy was to integrate into

00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:41,780
everything we got awarded of we got

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:46,819
recognized like for info roll the Black

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:49,549
Duck owt has some awards of innovations

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,790
and his ability and even got showcased

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,889
by Google on the new Google next cloud

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,609
in San Francisco early this year as one

00:03:54,889 --> 00:04:02,599
of the day startups using the Google

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:05,150
cloud platform so we got a really good

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,219
adoption buying and a community there

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,519
was created around rocket chat will now

00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,620
have about 600 developers commuters to

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,940
the project it's getting close to five

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,799
fifteen thousand stars and we tracked

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,079
the number of servers being deployed so

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,099
now you're reaching 150 thousand servers

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,710
which they all together have about 10

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,200
million users

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,390
and about that idea that we have that

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,960
people should be able to customize and

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,670
do whatever different use cases we found

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,790
on the wall that it that really happened

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,700
that is a stockbroker in Sweden that

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,100
created a rock chat where they they used

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,810
to talk to their clients and there are

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,760
whole new features for when you're

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,420
talking about one specific stock or a

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,740
fund they get the news they get

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,050
different graphs about the progress or

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,720
can even give orders to by himself from

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,180
inside the chat we have this this other

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,970
company that we help them to build chat

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,600
for universities where each student each

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,490
teacher becomes the moderator of each

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,550
channel so I have a very separated

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,590
access layer and they have submit papers

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,510
and then can discuss the papers discuss

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,010
the work that students are doing we have

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,850
this other company it's called

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:25,360
steam steam connect and they also build

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,310
a rocket chat for hospitals so every

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,580
patient then becomes a channel and then

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,250
invites all the doctors invite all the

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,200
the x-ray machines and they so all the

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,300
exams get posted into the channel and

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,940
they get to discuss and talk to nurses

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,650
order more exams so it really proved

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,260
that we have traction in different

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,930
industries so by the end of next year we

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,669
got approached by NEA who made an offer

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,430
and we closed the deal in series a round

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,860
and they invested five million dollars

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,270
that was yeah almost a year now so we

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,690
have been focusing since then in

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:05,140
creating sorry a SAS platform sorry

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,570
created a SAS platform and also started

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,560
have some company started like

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,530
contacting us because they wanted to pay

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,110
for support and have a cell a B NDS is

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,780
one of the largest banks in Brazil we

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,640
have a boom tool also has a server and a

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,180
support contract when you're doing a

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,220
work if they're PwC and even like Sony

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,350
the guys came to meet us they have 400

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,940
developers on the PlayStation platform

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,500
maybe the older customizations to

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,560
integrate with the single sign-on from

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:39,520
inside Sony but the way our vision is

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,639
they receive all this this changing from

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,250
the how you consume all the services

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,380
rather than having a PC and like having

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,970
on your website or then people go to

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,069
smartphones and became the new platform

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,509
you can see me in services via apps we

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,310
see now more and more than people are

00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,919
actually starting to consume services as

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,380
bought the leaf on whatever chat

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,039
platform they're consuming so looking at

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,949
this paradigm shift we see on the long

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,590
term creating the largest marketplace

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,900
for those apps BOTS and services so

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,020
that's how we can we see you can still

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,659
give away the core of our platform for

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,139
free can keep open source and you create

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,970
the ecosystem for a very very large

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,180
marketplace we already have 10 million

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,639
people and it's growing really fast so

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,919
this is the team today we have 25

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:34,470
developers plus 600 contributors

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,940
worldwide and we want you like not just

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,289
investors but other developers other

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:44,979
companies who are looking to be used and

00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,590
the next generation of collaboration

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:50,469
platform and invite you all to board our

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,680
ship and rewrite or write a new chapter

00:07:50,469 --> 00:08:02,830
or collaboration platforms in the web

00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:05,139
thank you so congratulations and I

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,409
really really like what you're doing my

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,330
big problem with all the new tools is

00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,650
they're all proprietary tools and

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,550
they're really good they're so much

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:19,449
better than email but email is still the

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,479
trusted open platform you don't have to

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,569
rely you don't have to trust slack to

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,360
manage your emails and and the trust

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:31,000
element drives the internet it is what

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,130
allows the internet to work okay so I

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,149
really like your embrace open source

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,680
thank you here it comes now so and the

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,419
other thing I really like about your

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,159
presentation is you talk about your

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,050
adoption curve and you have an

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,270
impressive adoption curve and that's

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,079
very exciting so my question is boils

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,970
down to who the hell are you guys so

00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:54,759
where are you based out of

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,910
whose idea was it and who's who am i

00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:01,709
trusting at rocket chat to manage this

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,240
project through to success so I'm

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,819
Brazilian so the company the

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,310
headquarters or the Development Center

00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:11,589
is still in Brazil most half of all of

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,220
that team is still based in Brazil Porto

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:18,189
Alegre familiar for you down south

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:23,500
the idea behind was mine I'm the founder

00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:25,660
and the CEO and I guess I always been

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,819
passionate about open source since

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,680
University time when I published my

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,810
first open source project and that

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,970
attracted some guys from IBM to go all

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,709
the way down to Brazil just to meet me

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,899
and I was to university they wanted to

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:41,350
meet me and see if I could work on a

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:43,959
project for them writing on what you see

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,620
is what you get editor on the web early

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,050
days and I was running my or company so

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,879
I've I was flattered but I still kept

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,519
running the projects and then I guess

00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,529
years later when I had the opportunity

00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,730
to build something that I think ok those

00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,129
guys are build something great but I

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,439
agree view like we need to bring this

00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:04,899
back to open so it can be ubiquitous I

00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,269
think email is a big witness because

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,680
there's pretty much no barrier for entry

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,899
right if you want to host your server

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,089
you host it if gonna get Gmail get Gmail

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:16,089
if I want to send a message and only to

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:19,959
ask you what platform are you in and we

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,149
believe we need to bring these and the

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,399
new UX and messaging apps together and

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,490
that was like our problem we build it

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,319
because we wanted to see that happening

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,360
the community got really excited and I

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:34,019
don't know it's a very organic thing

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,149
that is happening and we always are

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,639
going for MIT license in all the stuff

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,579
every building or we are building a SAS

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,730
because we want to remove one of the

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,809
barriers for entrance we help other

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,389
hosting providers to actually offer

00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:51,220
rocket shell even though we have

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,829
containers being publishing all the

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,110
major container marketplaces we just

00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,420
want this to spread and keep the license

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,579
and we think the marketplace is then the

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,959
key to really generate revenue we have a

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,179
lot of people developing plugins and

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,860
extensions and all those bots they're

00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:07,170
coming to us

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,720
we want to be able to your users the if

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,610
they need about to do customer support

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,350
we have this bought and then we have the

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:19,650
marketplace for all those those add-ons

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:21,780
and extras for the you know you should

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,840
some pretty large enterprises up there

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,600
you know Bennett a and Citibank and some

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,760
others what was the entry point I mean

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,310
obviously they all still have email yeah

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,540
right they probably have some internal

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,610
collaboration platform for publishing

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,910
information if they're anything like the

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,730
one I work for so what's the entry point

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,040
and how do you start to grow within

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,750
large customers to drive a you know what

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,710
I would call a reliable revenue base I

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,320
realize you're giving away at the

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,610
platform and benefiting from the

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,200
affiliates who come in and use your

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,880
platform but how did how do you get the

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,810
ball rolling with major customers so

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,080
like only being a BMDs example they they

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,420
had some hackathons on in the bank and

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,880
over and over you're trying to build

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,830
collaboration platforms so in one point

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,220
the dev team the IT teams all right it

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,510
must

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,660
there must be something out there that

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,720
we can use they tested a few options

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,030
they on the only chose rocket chat they

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,280
installed and really only after they

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,530
were about already a few hundred users

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,880
they called us and asked like will you

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,410
have been using your platform for quite

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,240
a while we want to know who you guys are

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,160
can you come over and do a presentation

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,570
for me so then I arrived there I thought

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,450
it were going to be a small meeting they

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,700
actually had a room for like 200 people

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,890
from the bank then wanted to hear who we

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,110
were obviously the fact that I'm also

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:44,250
Brazilian but I'm very happy and excited

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,660
about this but and then all they are

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,260
running on three thousand people and

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,740
scaling gradually Deutsche Bahn the

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,470
that's by far the largest company they

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,810
have three hundred thousand employees

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,760
only a hundred thousand 150,000 they say

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,060
you use actually use computers because

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,280
they have drivers and and so and then we

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,830
started scaling because they also they

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,780
found us and then came they came to us

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,670
saying wow we have this problem they

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,520
were building actually way for the

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,470
service

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,600
customer service team to talk to the to

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,420
the passengers and they want to have a

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,070
very easy way so they want to use SMS so

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,280
we did an integration rocket chat where

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,830
people traveling can SMS a number and it

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,830
falls into a channel then it gets from

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,380
the queue a specific agent and they and

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,950
also for them was very important it gets

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,710
the message piped through language

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,860
interpreter and then formulates a query

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,840
goes into five different knowledge bases

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,570
and then gives the answers for the

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,940
service team and they have just click

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,560
choose one and then they can add it if

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,800
you want and then set it back and then

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,170
the system you know if you came via SMS

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,970
I should reply by SMS if came by email

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,670
reply by email now I have Facebook

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,170
integration and Twitter and so we start

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:08,660
the community start building all those

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:12,510
bridges but if all of them was they had

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,850
this requirement then the proprietary

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,430
solutions could not address and they and

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,840
when to finally open sirs and they chose

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:24,810
us after trying a few different options

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:28,740
okay so so great presentation two-part

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:31,680
question first is tell me about how you

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,600
manage your role map the challenge was

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,890
managing a product used by 10 million

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,990
people and use it all slightly

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,430
differently role map coming out with a

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,110
standard set a role map that pleases the

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,270
crowd is actually very challenging

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,980
obviously open source have some features

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,510
that you can offer with that from the

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,400
community but I'll like to hear that

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,440
about your process is the first part of

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,450
a question second part of a question on

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,100
a different tangent is that what's your

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,600
revenue model not that is super

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,310
important for you right now but I'm just

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,240
curious how you guys are thinking about

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,760
that so the first part is the

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,630
architecture help us make the roadmap

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,300
more flexible and because we have a

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,920
component architecture there are other

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,080
people come and ask I will need this

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,670
feature so sometimes you just need one

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,280
of the develops to tell him down how to

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,750
build and then it can create that

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,070
feature as a as a plugin so we have our

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,670
roadmap things that we're gonna use our

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,080
developers to do but we dedicate a good

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,820
part of our day or help in the community

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,520
building the features that they want and

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,550
then they actually do the pull request

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,040
and edit and we have for instance one of

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,560
the biggest poor request was from the

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,410
Department of Defense in us we didn't

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,020
have a layered enough customizable

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,700
enough access and Rosen permission

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,010
system and they were like wow we need to

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,100
comply with the DoD five-o whatever

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,270
there was a pack so we helped them to

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,760
build it and then he did a pull request

00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,430
of all the api's and all the parts

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,650
wasn't on our world map so it was a

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,600
really great collaboration and our our

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,570
architecture allowed us to do this most

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,700
of times the second part sorry he was

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,970
talking about the road map the revenue

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,010
model so now we have about 20 companies

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,170
paying for some larger companies being

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:20,160
for support and SL A's

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,050
some companies pay for the specific

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,650
professional services and developing

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,780
plugins but the end goal we have some

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,490
companies paying for the SAS and by the

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,200
end goal I think we want is the

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,520
marketplace but it's not just a single

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,650
revenue motive it's not just as a source

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,740
just the support or it's kind of a mix

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,550
between other things and maybe because

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,250
some people tell me like you should

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,980
choose one and folks in one but the way

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,840
we see is each one of them if we don't

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,340
have it it becomes a barrier for

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,830
entrance if we don't have a marketplace

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,290
the to not be complete if you don't have

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,940
a SAS some people not use because they

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,760
don't want to deal with the complexity

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,920
so it was almost trying to address the

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,170
reasons why people would not use rockets

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,630
yet and we're finding we want to have

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:10,170
your bifidus we want to be as broad as

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:13,160
email so oh great Gabriel Engel the

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:16,449
rocket man from rocket chat

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,449
