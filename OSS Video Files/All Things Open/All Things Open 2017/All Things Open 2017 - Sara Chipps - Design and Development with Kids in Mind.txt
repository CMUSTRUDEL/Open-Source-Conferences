thank you up thank you Alex

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:15,360
mm-hmm alex is so kind he didn't say

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:16,859
that I just called him Matt twice thank

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,510
you guys so much for coming and for all

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,080
the kind words today everyone has been

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,119
really awesome this is a this is and I

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,939
can only act can you see me I can only

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,740
attribute it to the city in New York

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,960
when people come up to you and start

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,279
talking to you you have to it's a little

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,309
scary sometimes they're trying to kidnap

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,140
you so it's good it's nice to be in a

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,010
city where people say hi to each other

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,660
not in a scary way all right so I'm not

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,340
gonna if you were if you saw this

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,399
morning I'm not gonna we go over the

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,820
same stuff I wanted to dig a little bit

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,250
deeper into how we built the hardware

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,890
behind jewel bots what our philosophy is

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,870
around teaching a little bit about our

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,329
journey going from software to hardware

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,659
which is a crazy thing and teach a

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,670
little bit about how that stuff works so

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,720
you have the official afternoon talk

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,700
longer than 15 minutes a lot of you

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,830
probably know this stuff of your parents

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,600
but there are a lot of parents that

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,909
really want their kids learning how to

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,310
code and schools are trying desperately

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,710
to keep up I talked to parents and

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,020
teachers all the time the problem is

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,530
that software developers make a lot more

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,200
money than teachers in general and if

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,869
you know how to build software and your

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,090
option is becoming a teacher and making

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,100
maybe a third of what you would make as

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,200
a software developer it's not even

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,710
really a question you know you have a

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,619
family to you so a lot of schools are

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,850
struggling to find ways to teach kids

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:03,290
how to how to code I know in New York

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,670
City we are working I think it's by 2022

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,530
they've committed to have every school

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,039
have a computer science program that's

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,820
five years from now that's like forever

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:17,840
and so

00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,640
working hard to get to get these

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,260
programs in schools has been great for

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,930
us we've had a privilege to work with

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,360
Girl Scouts and girls who code and

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,000
teachers and things like that and so

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,730
often and often it's them we're teaching

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,780
or parents we're teaching that our new

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:39,860
coders which is really neat so this is a

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,590
timeline of what a little and it's a

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,920
little bit of a salesy slide I'm sorry

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,720
bill and I did say we're cool I need

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,770
everyone to know that

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:55,370
so Joel watts kind of started with me

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,050
saying talking to women and hearing them

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,450
say you know I didn't know what an

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,060
engineer was until I was in college and

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,010
by then it was too late and I didn't

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,480
know you know people knew what they were

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,710
doing I didn't know what I was doing how

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,360
do and I didn't know how to get involved

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:15,350
so I started hacking on Arduino which is

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,150
a gateway drug to consorting a consumer

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,310
product because what ends up happening

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,250
is you do something with Arduino and

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,530
you're like this isn't hard at all and

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,440
how hard could it be to make a consumer

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:31,280
product turns out really hard it's not

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,220
the same thing at all but so it was me

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,390
just hacking on Arduino and I was

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,430
working on a great company called

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,080
Flatiron school which I don't know if

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,269
you saw today sold till we work which is

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:48,170
pretty happy for them and and I went and

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:50,330
so it was my it was my side project and

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,280
and then I had a friend named Brady

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,900
Forrest who had started a hardware

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,800
accelerator called highway 1 and

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,720
basically the way they work is if you

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,720
apply to highway 1 if you get accepted

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,019
they give you some seed money for your

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,220
company and they have people there that

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,590
will help you with things like

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,860
electrical engineering and industrial

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,290
design firmware development which was

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,690
really neat for us because I didn't know

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,980
any of those things however somehow that

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,850
didn't scare me I don't really know why

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,560
and so I did a lot of user research

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,280
there and I'll and I'll and I'll go over

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
that

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,100
a little bit then we did some take your

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,340
daughter to hack days which we based on

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,260
Arduino platforms and we had people come

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,240
to New York and San Francisco bring

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,980
their daughters we built some neat stuff

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,340
with Arduino we're now doing those with

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,260
jewel-box which is really fun and then

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,570
we did our Kickstarter that I'll go over

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,430
a little bit we did an accelerator

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,100
called TechStars that helped us was the

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,020
business side of things

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,690
we signed a manufacturer we raised a

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,550
seed round shift our pre-orders just

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,990
talking to someone before about that

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,240
feeling when you when you have a funded

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,280
Kickstarter it is both the best and the

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,440
worst thing in the world because you're

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,150
so happy and then you're like man I hope

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,740
I was right about all those things I

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,760
said it's really hard and I really have

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,430
a lot of empathy for you know people who

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,050
who whose projects are late and all

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,470
those things it's really it's it's

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,330
really difficult and so and then after

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,140
that we shipped our pre-orders we went

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,979
on target.com

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,950
we went in the wired store Microsoft

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,290
stores gave us out this year they one

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,520
day Microsoft emailed us and it wasn't

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,680
even Microsoft it was like their

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,750
marketing team and was like how many do

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,640
you have and we were like I don't know

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,470
we have like 800 and they were like can

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,160
you just send us all of them we were

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,419
like yeah and it turns out they like

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,860
gave them out as part of a weekend

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,660
program but that's something that you

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,010
learn you really can't predict that so

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,650
we were two months without inventory

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,870
because Microsoft just bought everything

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,830
which is which is awesome and awful at

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,020
the same time so at highway one we

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,600
learned a lot about I have a clicker

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,860
here I'll just use this learned a lot

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,650
about user research they I've mentioned

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,270
this a little bit before my idea was I

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,530
was gonna make a bracelet you could wake

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,060
up in the morning you could be like oh

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm wearing blue today and I'll turn my

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,370
bracelet blue and that'll be really fun

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,690
but what we heard from girls is that

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,030
they really weren't into that and I'm

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,470
glad that we asked them when we got to

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,240
highway 1 they told us all kinds of

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,130
stories about like companies that had

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,320
spent millions of dollars developing a

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,820
product that no one wanted

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,160
it's not the same as software because

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,930
software you can prototype almost

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,360
anything in six to eight weeks right

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,360
like six to eight weeks you've got an

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,650
MVP of something and that cycle in

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,920
hardware is nine to twelve months so

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,450
things that take nine to twelve months

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,860
you're spending a lot of money a lot of

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,780
resources so if you don't do it

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,740
correctly you're in for a lot of trouble

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,750
so what we did is we reached out to

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,120
schools in the area and we were like hey

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,610
we'll come teach your kids

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,440
intro to electronics intro to

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,270
programming if we can ask them some

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,970
questions and teachers were stoked they

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,710
were like this is a great opportunity we

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,800
got to go meet kids here from them which

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,660
is really neat and as I mentioned this

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,250
morning the friendship thing just came

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,660
up over and over and over and over again

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,370
we were like what can we build for you

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,800
and when we started saying a friendship

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,780
bracelet that reacts to your friends

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,940
that's when they were like oh my

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,860
goodness that sounds so excited which is

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:47,660
really great um I don't know this guy's

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:51,230
working okay so we took all their

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,960
feedback we wrote it all down we met and

00:07:51,230 --> 00:08:00,470
we talked about what that would look

00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:03,170
like my to my chagrin so we knew was

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,240
gonna be a bracelet because it would be

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,070
too big of a ring because of how big the

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,590
electronics would have to be be this

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,720
crazy ring and if we got like a necklace

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,520
and it had notifications you might not

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,810
see it right like it's not right in

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,030
front of you so we knew it was going to

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:22,700
be a bracelet we sketched probably about

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:26,240
40 or 50 different designs and gave them

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,750
all out to vote on them I hate the

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,430
flower I hated the flower I you know I

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,840
really didn't want to come and say we're

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,610
gonna teach your daughter so code with

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,650
this flower you know I but we sent it to

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,300
them the flower but we had pinwheels and

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,450
stars and all kinds of things the flower

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,080
won by like a landslide and so here we

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,560
are with the flower but stuff like that

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,670
has been really neat for us since the

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,209
beginning because you think you remember

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,889
what it's

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,540
like to be twelve-year-olds you really

00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,249
have no idea you totally forget all

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,259
those times when you were 12 when you're

00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,759
like I will never when I'm an adult I

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,279
will never do this I will always

00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,569
remember you don't remember I found

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,149
myself standing in front of a lot of

00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:09,920
classes saying just so you guys know I

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,100
may be an adult but I'm one of the cool

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:19,579
ones we just tell you they don't believe

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,459
you and I'm not so that was that wasn't

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,709
he that was a new process so after our

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,749
research and talking to them we came up

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,889
with the functionality of Joule baths we

00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,569
wanted to have an active online

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,600
community where they can share with each

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,819
other because they love talking about

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,860
sharing with each other and learning

00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,660
from each other and just fellowship and

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,459
community in general is something that

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,689
was super important to them so we knew

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,600
that this was going to be an important

00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:46,910
aspect of what we built the sending

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,809
secret messages thing was huge they

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,119
liked to come up with their own

00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:52,369
languages like I talked to this one

00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:54,290
developer whose daughter was using

00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:56,050
cuneiform to communicate with her

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,249
brother

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,110
cuneiform isn't like really big with

00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:02,449
them but coming up with languages that

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,100
are all their own it's a bit it's a big

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:07,279
thing so that was an exciting part for

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,199
them and then just the superpowers with

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,449
code right like we want to make you a

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:13,369
cool thing without the code you don't

00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,660
have to code it so people aren't like oh

00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:19,459
I don't want to set this thing up but

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,769
make it cooler if you code it so we

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:23,600
worked a lot on different designs and

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,230
prototypes and what I learned about

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,540
building hardware is that you start with

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,610
two kinds of prototypes one that's

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,589
called a looks like prototype which is

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,709
this is what I want my product to look

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,610
like in the end if you look at these

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:43,069
pictures the the one with the blue

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,600
bracelet that was our original looks

00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:49,549
like prototype so in my in my dreams the

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,959
the electronics lived inside there we

00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,730
had this like little silver button on

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,499
the top that you can't really see but it

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,110
was tiny I mean this really nice band

00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:59,230
and and then you have a works like

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,410
prototype which is where you take the

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,910
electronics and make it work like your

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,910
product that you want it to look like

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,610
and work like in the future and

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,770
and then you proceeded to iterate on

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,300
making those two things closer to each

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,540
other and then you have your finished

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,790
product you know this is so with your

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,230
works like product so you can test it

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,330
see if it's interesting to people or

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,930
works like prototype is that big old

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,000
that big silver one at the bottom it's

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,590
like as big as your hand but we got to

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,060
take that to people and be like does

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,550
this fund does this feel fun would you

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:38,410
like to play with this so that was a

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:42,280
neat process we experimented a lot with

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:46,300
different looks and feels so that

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,790
initial bracelet looks really great and

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,110
I loved it we learned two things when

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,350
you pull them apart when you pull the

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,940
snap apart quickly it breaks which was a

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,190
big thing and we figured we could fix

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,310
that until we figured out that little

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,010
girl's wrists are very different between

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,900
the girl like between your five-year-old

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,670
wrists to a thirteen-year-old wrist it's

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,420
like night and day it's like a world of

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,650
difference so I we had to go with

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,350
something that was a little more

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,520
sizeable the first thing we thought of

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,650
were these guys those are hair elastics

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,630
right they wear hair elastics around

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,010
their wrists already so we were like oh

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,960
cool they'll be excited about this the

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,490
kids really liked it but parents were

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,080
like that looks really cheap to me and I

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,150
wouldn't want to spend money on that

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,340
that looks like a cheap product and so

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,640
finally we ended up with a nylon band

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,200
that I'll talk about in a few minutes so

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,760
those are the different things we

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,430
learned about you know when we were

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,220
iterating our looks like prototype as

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,040
far as our works like prototype that

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,900
board in the middle is our first board

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:57,160
it has a standard ARM based RF do we

00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:00,160
know module on it that square thing and

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,890
then so that does that's a standard

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,860
something you can buy off-the-shelf it

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,800
has Bluetooth and some other things in

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,640
it as well and as a button a motor and

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,550
the RGB LEDs and then we iterated on

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,589
that that is a little closer to our

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,440
board the round one that's right next to

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:23,380
it the thing that takes up the moe

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,570
space and our device is the battery we

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,410
learned that batteries need to be big in

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:34,360
order to have a lot of you know battery

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,860
life and so we that's one piece of

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,580
feedback we get sometimes is making it

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,980
smaller

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,360
the only from parents so far like kids

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,470
don't kids don't say that the parents

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,250
are like can you make it smaller so

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,840
we're working on it um so after after we

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,970
got to this point where we had our works

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,360
like prototype we had our looks like

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,030
prototype we did our Kickstarter and

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,510
this was a neat process Kickstarter's

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,710
are not especially now like as things go

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,210
it used to be you could like have a

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,240
phone camera and be like I want to make

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,410
a potato salad and that's like an

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,020
exaggeration that could that what's

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,340
crazy but um it used to be it's like you

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,110
could be like me and my friends want to

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,490
make a board game and you could film

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,750
that and put it on Kickstarter and it

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,800
would get funded because people believed

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,270
in you

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,060
but Kickstarter's have gotten

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,610
increasingly harder as people up their

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,550
budget of how much it takes to launch a

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,110
Kickstarter right like you know people

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,520
are spending like thirty to sixty

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,000
thousand dollars just on their

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,910
Kickstarter campaign which is wild and

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,610
we were we put our campaign together for

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,080
under $10,000 and then included the

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,240
video and things like that but took a

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,340
lot of work it was over several months

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,170
um so there's nothing easy about doing a

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,360
Kickstarter it's just a different form

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,610
of fundraising and so my plan for

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,380
Kickstarter was I knew our goal was

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,550
thirty thousand dollars and thirty

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,310
thousand dollars would have gotten us a

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,880
much uglier version of what we have now

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,980
but thirty and probably that big ol

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,980
prototype just strapped it or under it

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,630
and and so I knew that I had to get a

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,830
thousand dollars a day so I was like

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,750
Sarah you don't get to go to bed until

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,880
you get a thousand dollars every day

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,350
this month and you can do that you need

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,820
to email people you need to call people

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,850
and then we fund it in the first day

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,100
which was so awesome that was actually

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,680
really cool and unexpected we were

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,990
really happy with that and we got

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,350
several times our funding goal about

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,880
halfway through the Kickstarter process

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,980
Bill Nye was also running a Kickstarter

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,580
at the time and I just got this email in

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,770
our mess

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,890
box with the video from Bill Nye being

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,240
like jewel bots are cool and I like just

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,780
screamed like in the middle of the

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,790
office I was like so great so that was a

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:51,100
really cool experience Kickstarter is a

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:53,080
great community they do they do get you

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,670
started with a group of people that

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,980
really care about your project we were

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,280
four months late for five months late

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,930
five months later our project we

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,180
communicated as much as possible which

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:09,940
is important things that made us late

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:12,280
the laws of physics so so it turns out

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:16,120
so I'm gonna talk to you a little bit

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,610
about our board but our microprocessor

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,960
that we used but our microprocessor was

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,600
sold to us by a really awesome

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,760
salesperson very good at his job what

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,060
that salesperson did not tell us was

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:32,200
that the board was not even in alpha

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,360
when he sold it to us so when we were in

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,650
the process of development and we went

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,080
to order okay now we have to make a

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,880
hundred units for testing we learned

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,320
that all of our micro process it was

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,330
totally sold out everywhere because

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,650
other people that were using it for

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,450
testing and people were buying them up

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,830
because they really liked them and there

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:53,530
was an eight week lead time on on the

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:56,320
board so that means there's eight weeks

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,060
where you're paying engineers and you're

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,250
not doing anything and there's nothing

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,380
you can do about it and people asked

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,790
often you know everyone says Hardware so

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,560
expensive what's so expensive about

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,480
Hardware like is there gonna be a big

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,100
cost that's like a surprise no there's

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,680
no big cost as it's a surprise it's just

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,380
time you just never think oh this is

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,300
actually gonna take a year you're like

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,320
this will take four months and then you

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,089
have you know you have a team that

00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,680
you're supporting during that time and

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,250
that's how Hardware can get so expensive

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:30,820
but in the end we were able to do it we

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:32,080
shipped last November and it was it was

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
really awesome to know that they were in

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,290
the world we held our breaths that day

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,030
and we were like God if we hope all

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,790
these work we're pretty sure that they

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:43,030
do we tested them a bunch our initial

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,830
units it was kind of a bummer and if you

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,169
were a Kickstarter backer I apologize in

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,859
person we had to have people

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,690
update the firmware so the what we

00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,799
learned what you learn about firmware

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,710
and I'll talk about that a little more

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:59,470
as well is imagine the world of software

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,779
if open-source never happened and that

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,999
is the world of firmware there's no open

00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,679
source and firmware it's like very very

00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:09,580
rare you see an open source firmware

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,619
project and so the firmware was actually

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,119
the hardest part of building for us it

00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,429
took a lot longer because sometimes

00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,369
documentation is just wrong right it's

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,989
just wrong like and you work on the same

00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,090
thing for three weeks and there's no

00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:24,580
Stack Overflow I mean there's there are

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,570
sites there's like EE Stack Overflow but

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,200
everyone's working on different

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,450
processors and the problems people are

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,299
running into are so different that it's

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,769
not like I'm working with jQuery and I

00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:40,389
need to know how to load an image you

00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:42,279
know what I mean so that was that was

00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,470
difficult so we had to ask people to

00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,450
update their firmware by plugging it in

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,889
and uploading with Arduino IDE so that's

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,769
some of the pains of early hardware so

00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:52,869
if you did that I really appreciate that

00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,730
we also offered to if people want to

00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:58,749
mail it to us we'd do it so some people

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,369
did that which is nice so the product

00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:04,919
that we ended up with were these guys so

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:07,330
the bands in charge right charms are

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,070
interchangeable which is fun we're

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,409
working on new bands and charms for that

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,259
as well and that's been the design from

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:18,279
the beginning we ended up with these

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:20,259
nylon bands you know they're sizable we

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,539
have so many different sizes for so many

00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,879
different wrists which is great you can

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:26,739
throw them in the washing machine

00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:28,059
important when you have kids and also

00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:29,619
something I learned is part of this

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,720
process of how many different kinds of

00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,159
plastics there are there's all kinds of

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,899
different plastics that you can use with

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,539
different flexibilities and things like

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:41,049
that so that was a neat part of the

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:44,220
process and then the jewel box hardware

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,230
lives in this piece of plastic and the

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,940
combination of the charm and the

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,999
hardware housing makes them

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,259
water-resistant so we had lots of tests

00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,389
where we're just like throwing it in

00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:57,429
buckets of water to make sure that it

00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,620
that was okay so if you end up doing

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:07,740
that your jewel BOTS will be fine

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:11,519
so on our board is our is a button each

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,559
duel bot has a button for RGB LEDs the

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,659
primary colors of light if you don't

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,700
know are red green and blue not red

00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:21,870
yellow and blue like the primary colors

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:26,130
and between those you can make 2.7

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,720
million colors we have a microUSB port

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,899
so that's how you plug them in and you

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,090
charge them that's how you upload code

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:38,190
and this is our microprocessor the NRF

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:42,149
51 by Nordic and the cool thing about

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:45,690
the NRF 51 super-new and the reason why

00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:49,769
it's so forward-thinking is because the

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,059
way Bluetooth works is devices your

00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,519
devices that you have at home are either

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,409
central or peripheral devices meaning

00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,230
they're either receiving messages or

00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:00,440
sending messages and most of them can

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,090
only do one at a time if not all of them

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,480
they can either receive a message or

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:09,990
send a message one of those two things

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,380
the NRF 51 allows your microprocessor

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,880
over bluetooth to have eight

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,169
simultaneous central and peripheral

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,779
relationships so that means a java can

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,899
talk to three other Jule bots and your

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,360
Alexa and your phone and a drone all at

00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:28,679
the same time and I don't know why

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
you're communicating with the drone

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,909
maybe it's following you maybe it's just

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,120
taking pictures of you as you walk but

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,220
that is those are the capabilities of a

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,230
dual Bop so that's been a fun part of

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,389
the process it's really hard for us

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,940
actually to stay focused on the here and

00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:46,830
now cuz because we're like what if Alexa

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,419
you know says hey welcome home Sarah

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,760
when you get home and it's you know text

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,590
your mom and it's like hey I'm home so

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,039
I'm just putting those ideas out there

00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:01,110
you build that cuz we're we're doing

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:03,600
we're focusing on the small game so we

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,029
also built an app I talks to your jewel

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,980
but right now the app will connect your

00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:09,330
jewel bot and tell you here are your

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,120
friends here's how many friends you have

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,190
of different friend groups and we have

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,830
more features planned for the future

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,269
lets you set up your device easier we

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,799
made the instructions easier on your

00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,269
phone we built it with cordova ionic

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,779
basically partially because I love

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:30,840
JavaScript and haven't donek objective-c

00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:33,269
partially because partially because they

00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,759
have a really good Bluetooth library so

00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:40,190
if you're working with Bluetooth it's

00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:43,200
better than the native iOS and Android

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,600
applications and but we're only on

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,809
iPhone right now

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:55,950
open-source as I'm a pull request

00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:57,960
welcome so alright so this is a little

00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,070
bit about how hardware works and these

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,990
are all things I've learned over the

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,279
last four years so if you don't know

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:07,590
this stuff welcome so just like central

00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,230
and peripheral devices over Bluetooth

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:14,389
your microprocessor your printed circuit

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,980
board sends messages in between your

00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:19,169
microprocessor and the components on

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,080
your board so there's a copper pore

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:24,629
which is the the little the copper that

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,720
you see and it sends messages using

00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:30,679
electricity using a clock master and

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,610
slave out and master and slave out

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,029
component to microprocessor

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,539
microprocessor to component and that's

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:42,080
how those things work the documentation

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:47,120
for building on stuff looks like this

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:51,000
and as I spoke before we knew we had to

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,720
stay with C and couldn't fit a compiler

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,350
on jewel-box cuz it's so small and so

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,450
how do we make C something that kids are

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,230
going to be comfortable with can learn

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:07,649
can right we had this big chasm between

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:11,090
okay they can code it versus they want

00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:13,710
to code it so all our code uses this

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,740
function it's basically how you

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:22,919
communicate from a central peripheral on

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:24,960
the printed circuit board and so we had

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,759
to take that and abstract it out and

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,900
make it something that's accessible for

00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,280
kids

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,309
so we've been working on that for a long

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,320
time and now we host events with them

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:36,680
and this is how we teach them okay this

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,520
is going to be an interactive session

00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm going to put something on the screen

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:49,370
and if you know the answer to what it

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:57,720
says raise your hand do not yell it out

00:24:49,370 --> 00:25:06,540
okay what does this say I love tacos so

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:14,450
great what about this one slide to the

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:14,450
moon exactly and what about this one

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:21,330
great you guys are really awesome at

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:24,390
this so what does this have to do with

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,240
anything so what and so when we teach

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:30,660
about what functions are functions are

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,690
kind of like emoji and the way that um

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,700
you can use three emoji to say I love

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,770
tacos so you could use ten letters and

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,300
the reason why we use functions is

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,040
because we don't want to have to write

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,380
the same things over and over and over

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,170
again so when we find ourselves having

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,170
to use the same commands again and again

00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,690
and again instead of doing that we just

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,220
write a function and we name our

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,809
functions all kinds of things in our

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,100
events that's the cool thing about

00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,750
having code that doesn't have to be

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,950
scalable you can have a function called

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:06,059
unicorn or jewelry or giraffe and that

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:11,309
is super fun when you're a kid or an

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:14,010
adult actually the so we have several

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:16,110
different things we teach like this sure

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,090
if they went to work at Oracle tomorrow

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,490
and said I know about functions because

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,710
they're like emoji people would be like

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,090
no that's not true but also your 11 year

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,700
old is not going to work at Oracle

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:30,929
tomorrow so it's okay if they understand

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:33,600
functions like they are emoji for now so

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:39,060
the different parts of the jewel bot

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,960
that can be programmed are the LEDs the

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:46,800
button

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:49,110
the buzzer and using those together you

00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:56,580
can make some cool interactions and some

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:58,380
cool apps we call them mods so LEDs so

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,150
if you can see this you can wow this is

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,890
a really big screen that's great

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,460
so this is the function that we have in

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:07,710
our firmware that writes LEDs this is

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,130
not close to a language that they can

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:13,530
understand so as a second part we give

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,210
them so this is our firmware and then on

00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,240
top of that we have like a sandbox that

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:22,200
we give them with functions that work

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:27,540
for them so we have things like LED turn

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:31,710
on all or LED dot you know turn on an

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:36,140
individual LED we give them access to

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:38,400
colors like magenta and blue and green

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,200
in a way that they can just write

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,580
magenta or blue or green because they

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,130
don't want to write you know a

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,690
hexadecimal address for a certain type

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,630
of magenta they're fine with just the

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,180
word magenta and this is something that

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,160
was a big disagreement on the team and I

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,480
make sure to point this out every time I

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,110
talk about it because I think we're

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,850
close to a solution numbering the LEDs

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,400
are giving them a position we ended up

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,330
giving them Southwest southeast

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,590
Northwest North East but kids don't

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,390
really get that I think so I think we

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,130
might change to numbers someone had the

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,430
idea to change it to like an o clock

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:15,390
like 2 o'clock 4 o'clock so we're gonna

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:17,310
revisit that conversation and so they if

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:20,130
they want to play with the LEDs they

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:22,980
basically just need to know LED turn on

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,650
all or LED set light and then they get

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,150
access to functions like this where

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,940
they're just turning on a single light

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,900
they're turning off all the lights

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,940
they're flashing the lights we have

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,380
timers and things like that so I'm

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,340
actually going to show you how that

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,550
works and I'm gonna do it holding a

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,550
microphone

00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,990
it's all part of the magic okay so in

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,090
order to clone my Java so this is a

00:28:49,990 --> 00:29:01,270
jewel bot in order to code it I plug it

00:28:52,090 --> 00:29:03,600
in to a micro USB like this guy and I

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:11,640
opened up the Arduino development

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,640
environment okay so this is a new sketch

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:19,000
so this is where they start our dueño

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,370
sketch by default gives you a setup

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,470
and a loop your setup are things that

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,500
you want to write once into your

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,990
function and your loop is where you want

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,550
code that gets written immediately so

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,550
I'm going to type and then explain

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,420
or maybe I can get this guy okay so in

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,670
my loop I'm just gonna instantiate the

00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,450
LED class so they do that by saying led

00:29:51,670 --> 00:30:04,630
LED and then they can say things like

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:07,750
LED turn on oh you know I really thought

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,980
I took put down all my took away all my

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,080
notifications okay great

00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:20,200
turn on all and then I put in a color so

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,550
I might put magenta so and that's it so

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,590
that's a hello world that's where we

00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:27,030
start in all our events hello world for

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,030
Joel bot and

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:52,280
alright so in order to upload person

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,740
closing my messages I doubt anything

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,950
would be scandalous would happen but you

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:07,520
never know

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:09,260
magenta thank you thank you ok so in

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,650
order to cover my duel bot I first make

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,220
sure that my Joel bot board selected

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,620
when they first download the Java IDE

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,180
they can they just need to add the Joel

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,060
bots boards which is like a three step

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,850
process I have the correct serial port

00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,220
and then what I do is I hold down the

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:32,480
button for two seconds so that's one

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:38,810
locomotive two locomotive and my lights

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:45,050
flash purple I then hit upload want me

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:49,250
to save it I'm gonna save it and this

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,620
takes a few seconds one anecdote so

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:56,390
everyone has their own way of counting

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:59,630
seconds there are 1000s there are

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,980
Mississippi some people say millisecond

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,170
which doesn't make any sense it's not

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,750
correct actually does anyone have a

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:09,800
different one locomotive should ever see

00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:13,250
that one Mississippi Mississippi is a

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,930
big one so what I'm waiting for is for

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,310
this to do a rainbow color and watch

00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:21,770
this goes a rainbow color I know that my

00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:25,280
Joel bot is coded and I can take my Joel

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:30,850
bot off my micro USB because my firmware

00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:37,190
is ready okay so that's my rainbow color

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:39,230
and now if I unload I plug my duel bot I

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,630
have I like to put the charm on I have

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,340
my Birgitta lights on so that's my hello

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,660
world so there's not now you have a now

00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,240
you have a flashlight that's magenta

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,590
which is like okay but if it's your

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,580
first time ever coding it's really

00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,080
exciting because you get to see

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,430
something physically in person that you

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,650
have done and you have made this great

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,750
change in the world so that's what we

00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,180
always do together in our events for the

00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,510
first for the first thing and then we

00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,900
walk

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:08,200
through a lot of the other modules that

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:12,980
they have access to so for things like

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,230
the for things like animations we give

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,970
them access to different animations that

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,310
we've written like animation dot

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,130
rainbows give them a rainbow animation

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,900
which they love you know we also give an

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,910
animation called breathe all where the

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,400
lights come on slowly and turn off

00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:34,160
slowly and they can pick a color we give

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,260
them access to the button press event so

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,630
if they write a function for the button

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,510
press that allows them to take control

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,340
of the button pleasant in general and do

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,110
cool things so what's the coolest thing

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,760
we've seen so far is really is a

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,640
question that I get a lot that kids

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,190
build my favorite things are the

00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,680
friendship interactions but my beyond

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,150
favorite thing was beyond favorite that

00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,650
I hang out with 10 year olds a lot I

00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:04,550
have a favorite thing gonna beyond a

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:08,330
favorite thing my most favorite thing is

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:11,360
a game that was invented by one of our

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,669
ambassadors her name is sue me sue me

00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,830
has given two talks about jewel bots to

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:18,740
different development conferences in

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:22,550
front of adults which is a really brave

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,139
thing to do when you are her age I think

00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,179
believe she's 12

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,310
and this is a game called catch the

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,500
Leprechaun or we change the game based

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,260
on what your favorite color is so

00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,520
basically we pick a color and I'm

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,740
actually going to upload the game while

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm explaining to you so that I can show

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:45,040
you hold down button for two seconds

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:04,720
okay so this game basically what they do

00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:09,500
and please excuse the function names is

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,020
the Joule bot flashes all different

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,520
colors and you pick your favorite color

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,680
so catch the Leprechaun was based on the

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,550
color green I always pick blue because

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,950
it's my favorite color

00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,380
but you pick your favorite color based

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,360
on what it is and when the jewel bot

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,030
flashes that color you hit the button

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,980
and if you get it right

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,080
the colors move faster and faster and

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,000
faster and faster until you beat the

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,070
game if you get it wrong it restarts

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,050
from the beginning which has been a

00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,670
really fun game to build with kids they

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,430
get really excited it's actually really

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:44,960
hard to play they're much better at it

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:50,720
than we are as adults because they're

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:54,830
faster and they have tiny hands but the

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,880
game looks like this and in this case so

00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,490
we go through the process of making

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,150
functions and variables they learn about

00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:09,080
if statements conditional statements if

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:11,630
you can see monkey equals blue different

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,280
fun things like that and as a result so

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,830
when we get it right we get it wrong

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,110
we'll get it wrong first it flashes and

00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:23,210
buzzes which I felt the buzz and if we

00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:26,720
get it right the we get a rainbow and it

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:32,480
goes faster I'm not as good as this game

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,480
as most of them are yeah but it's super

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,610
fun if you want to play it let me know

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,820
play but yeah so that's how we make

00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,340
programming accessible to kids they're

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,750
great to work with they're super smart

00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,620
one thing people ask us all the time is

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,200
why we don't have a drag-and-drop

00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,530
interface dragon drop interfaces are

00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,250
great kids are really smart and they

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:57,230
don't really need that you know they are

00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:01,430
you know drag and drop is wonderful and

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:03,170
it introduces them to beginning coding

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,440
concepts we may still build a

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,230
drag-and-drop interface

00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,060
but you there's nothing like being a

00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,270
room with an eight-year-old who's so

00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,280
stoked about C++ it sounds crazy I know

00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,460
you might not believe me but I promise

00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,319
it's happening so if you work with kids

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,490
or you're interested in getting started

00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,380
working with kids or anything like that

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,180
feel free to reach out to me via email

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,369
I'd love to hear what you've learned

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:31,560
from them and vice-versa

00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:33,300
again I had that how you can help screen

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,369
but if anyone wants to build for duel

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,410
BOTS where we're around on github so

00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,970
thanks so much for coming today if you

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,580
have any questions feel free to come up
