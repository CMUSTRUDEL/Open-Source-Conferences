hi as Alex said I've been doing this

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,940
sort of thing for a little while the

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,469
obligatory second slide now that I've

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,820
told you that this is everyone's second

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,980
slide you will not be able to stop

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,210
seeing it in every presentation this is

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,590
the one where they establish their bona

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,119
fides and you're like but you're on the

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,490
stage I'm already listening to you you

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,850
don't have to convince me it's okay

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,130
but yeah I live in Minneapolis I newly

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,170
work at Microsoft so I had to carefully

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,869
drop the Microsoft logo in on the slide

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,989
i podcast with arrested DevOps

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,660
and i am the head of the global DevOps

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,840
day's organization I think we're in 50

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,270
or 51 cities worldwide on six continents

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,610
so if you would like to run DevOps tase

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,079
Antarctica talk to me because it would

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,320
be nice to level up and get that last

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,649
continent okay so the title of my talk

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,300
you may have noticed was a lie and if

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,260
you were sitting there looking at it

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,680
thinking but wait like you're not wrong

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,629
there's a lot more complexity in our you

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,610
know massively scalable fault tolerant

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,510
distributed systems that Alex was

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,110
referring to you that we're building

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,450
there's a lot more complexity than the

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,090
easy glib Oh computers are easy people

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,890
are hard I think the the hard with

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,600
people comes in when you realize that

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,439
just like we were hearing in all the

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,970
keynotes this morning there's a lot of

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,350
human components to open-source there's

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,409
a lot of human components to our

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,090
technology industry that we may have

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,090
spent a great deal of time optimizing

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,909
all of the places that our automated

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,369
systems can fail but we sometimes gloss

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,159
over or ignore the parts that we know

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,840
perfectly well things can go wrong with

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,240
the way our humans interact we just

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
don't spend as much time on it so let's

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,619
talk about it for example if we're gonna

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,780
we're going to talk about automation if

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,299
you look at this line like in the last

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,399
week there were 67 deploys at 496

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,070
changes by 18 people some of you are

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,290
thinking oh that's a slow week and and

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,290
some of you are thinking yeah it would

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,969
be really nice if we could do that and

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,239
like the funny part is this is from the

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,810
Flickr dev blog in 2008 and at this

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,680
point you're like oh but but wait

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,870
they're there web

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,209
scale or something like you know they're

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,680
not like us it's like everyone actually

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,200
can operate at the speed at the scale

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,269
but it's not usually technology getting

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,099
in the way of them being able to do that

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:33,000
it might be your change control review

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:35,099
board but I think that when we start

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,870
talking about exciting new technology a

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,540
lot of times people start thinking about

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,739
oh well there is that development team

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,900
that wants to do everything with

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,340
containers and then there's these people

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,440
who want to bring in this open source

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,790
project that we maybe haven't completely

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,590
vetted and we're not sure if we're ready

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,030
to go to production with it and there's

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,889
always that sneaking suspicion that

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,840
maybe some of the people are asking you

00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,459
to work with whatever insert exciting

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,290
new piece of the technology stack and

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,720
risk your whole business on it like

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,090
because they would like to work with

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,700
that thing like I've actually been in a

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,379
meeting where someone said I would

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,519
really like to build a custom message

00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,680
you know message bus and I was like why

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,139
and he goes because I'd like to build a

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,790
custom message bus it's like well okay I

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,280
mean if that's what you really want to

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,919
do but is that is that helping your

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,419
organization get to its goals and I

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,389
think this is one of the things like I'm

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,889
a technologist oh by the way fun fact I

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,260
majored in computer science partially

00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:35,669
because I didn't want to talk to people

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,019
spoiler alert but the a lot of times we

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,840
get really excited about the technology

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,599
but our organizations mission might not

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,090
be do some exciting technology put it on

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,680
your resume rinse repeat probably most

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,229
of our organizations don't have that as

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,500
a mission I mean I work in Microsoft now

00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,449
so we have a mission around empowering

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,519
people throughout the entire world and

00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,930
it's a you know it's written on the back

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,169
of our badges I haven't memorized it yet

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,239
been there for five weeks but it's um I

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,159
think it's really important when we're

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,150
making technology choices to think about

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:12,090
it to frame it in this way so like

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,970
trying to figure out how we get there I

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,299
think this is where we can fall down a

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,609
lot my my old boss at pivotal my good

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,469
friend Andrew clay Shafer likes to you

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,220
this is this is his rendition of you

00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:27,920
know the elephant or whatever and

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,690
I think it it can feel a kind of buzz

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,960
we're compliant and kind of ridiculous

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,440
to say it can't possibly be true that

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,060
every single thing you do in your day is

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,310
magically DevOps jazz hands

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,480
like really like let's talk about things

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,130
that actually get us to our goals and I

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,860
think it's it's important to realize

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,020
that the ecosystems that we're building

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,460
that we're building our technology in

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,020
and that we already exist in I mean I'm

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,190
how many like show hands how many of you

00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,750
get to operate in a completely

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,040
greenfield environment where you never

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,110
have to interact with anything that

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,660
already exists in the world right either

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,040
everyone's asleep or like I see one

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,160
person who I think is just adjusting

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,080
their glasses right it's like we're

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,170
dealing with really complex ecosystems

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,850
that have been built over time that

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,260
exist for a reason presumably if they

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,530
didn't matter we would just turn them

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,030
off but it's like oh the legacy thing we

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,590
might want to ignore it except we can't

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,490
because like that's where the customers

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,540
and money live and that's where

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,950
open-source is really important because

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,270
you don't want the really important

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,120
thing that your business or that your

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,760
organization's mission depends on to be

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,169
impossible to update and also perhaps

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,479
the vendor went out of business like

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,460
open source is a survival strategy for a

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,780
lot of our organizations because we

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,820
would very much like not to have

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,150
somebody else's business choices prevent

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,630
us from having our mission and it's I

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,330
think it's also really important to like

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,800
maybe name check the this kind of like

00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,560
ridiculous meme that we keep hearing

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,640
about about like disruption and

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,180
sometimes people are just talking about

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,910
like the startup that maybe will do a

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,400
small slice of what some other business

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,570
does and so like they should the the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
existing business should be really

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,650
worried in some cases sure yeah maybe

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,370
they should and another way is it's like

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,440
this is not very disruptive in that it's

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,600
very expected like we're we're all

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,550
expecting and creating innovation all

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,930
the time it's it's kind of like in the

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,910
this is a game of Settlers of Catan

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,650
where you know the pirate ship is coming

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,000
to attack and it's you might not know

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,160
exactly when it's coming but it's coming

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,860
on a pretty regular schedule like it is

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,130
going to happen and just being prepared

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,390
for the

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,940
innovation let's call it that's going to

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,430
happen is another reason that it's

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,560
really important for us to be working in

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,980
this open source space by the way quick

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,680
sidebar rant when I talk to enterprises

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,630
that are excited about bimodal IT I just

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,190
want to say like so what are you gonna

00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,630
tell us the people who you're putting in

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,640
sad mode and telling them they can't

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,350
innovate or do anything interesting or

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,410
do any resume driven development at all

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,880
or learn or change like how long are

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,470
they gonna keep working they're the ones

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,360
that stay how invested are they going to

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,880
be in your organization it's like

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,890
they're you're well you're not going to

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,800
change absolutely everything inside your

00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,600
company at the same time you also aren't

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,820
going to want to separate people into

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,080
the you're going to learn and you're

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,450
going to just keep the fires burning

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,950
like that's it's really bad again from

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,260
the human side of things for your people

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,580
to feel like they are in maintenance

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,530
mode and will never get to do anything

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:39,200
interesting again I should also like

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,160
speaking of innovation like we spend a

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,570
lot of time in our industry celebrating

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,880
pioneers celebrating first-movers

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,830
celebrating the startup celebrating the

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,320
entrepreneur celebrating that exciting

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,420
new idea that somebody you load out to

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,610
production and that somebody else

00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,320
probably is on call for and maybe it's

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,580
going to work and maybe there's a lot of

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,640
failure cases that you haven't thought

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,320
about and like if you look at Simon Ward

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Lee's pioneer settlers town planners

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,060
model I really like the settlers like

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,600
okay cool we have something that works

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,560
too for some values of works but can we

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,960
scale that up can we work have it keep

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,250
working after you update it again and

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,940
again and again and like that idea of

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:28,280
being ready to scale stuff up is you

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,160
know like operational maturity and it

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,380
also has a lot to do with do we have the

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,630
open ecosystem that we'll be able to

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,170
keep working in and this is this is why

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:43,070
open source is so important by the way

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:45,320
even if my kitten became you know a

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,940
complete expert on all of the technology

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,820
represented by the stickers he's sitting

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,610
on which you know he dealt was dead but

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,700
even

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,440
if you get everything working day one it

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,450
is really important to think about those

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,990
day two operations those day two

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,720
concerns just because even if you are

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,890
all about new product development

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,839
presumably you want there to keep being

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,310
money to be able to develop new products

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,420
and that's not going to happen if you

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,300
can't keep the ones that you've

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:17,990
developed running especially because

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:21,750
much like attack kittens grow up the the

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,360
code that you pushed your production I

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,829
have some bad news for you about how

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,990
much of that code is going to keep

00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:31,620
running long after you no longer work

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,649
there and there's I mean if you if you

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,850
used a credit card today you probably

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,950
interacted with a mainframe that's been

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,200
running for forty years and let's like

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:43,399
we get really excited about new things

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,200
but we also want to create sustainable

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,620
maintainable obtainable things because

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,050
every sedimentary layer of reality is

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,940
going to keep existing like it's it's

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,000
very rare to completely rip out and

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,730
replace anything and so it's I think

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,820
this is why it's really important for us

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,140
to have some degree of empathy for the

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,149
people that haven't back to those human

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,089
factors the people inside our

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,940
organization who may be their incentives

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,430
are set up slightly differently and

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,800
maybe they really don't want to let us

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,300
change something and it's probably just

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,800
because they're terrible people and hate

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,660
us right maybe probably not they

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,449
probably have a whole set of incentive

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,970
set up around whatever the outputs of

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:32,250
that system that previously working

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,649
system are they have some incentive set

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,630
up that they need to keep getting value

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,339
out of that so if you really want to

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,790
yoyo low your new thing out to

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,459
production okay I mean that's cool but

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:46,589
think about the that's why the testers

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,089
might be saying no or why the security

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,149
team might be tearing their hair out

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:53,670
like there probably is a reason it's

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,130
just maybe not one that you have to have

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,170
a lot of personal interaction with and

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,550
this is why we get really excited about

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,350
tooling attack and

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,110
I mean I'm totally on board with that

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,190
like there's after this conference well

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,830
after this conference I'm actually

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,269
leaving after lunch and going to another

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,380
conference but then I'm gonna go home

00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,230
and play without your container

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,459
instances like this is that we get into

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,200
tech cuz we're excited about this stuff

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,690
and we want to play with it but we also

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,490
do need to be able to interoperate with

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,890
our team members and you know I'll in

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,690
this role of Microsoft I roll up through

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,600
products so like anything that I do

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,010
figuring stuff out about hey when I

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
showed a demo of this at a conference

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,820
people didn't really like this part and

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,860
they were really curious about that I

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,010
got to take that back to product and

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,209
documentation there's a lot of

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,550
interconnected human pieces that aren't

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:49,779
necessarily just about exactly how that

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:53,200
particular feature worked and I think we

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,579
get really excited to about doing the

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,980
innovative thing whatever that

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,560
innovative thing might be and like I got

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,480
news for you right I rolled a bunch of

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,180
micro services out to production in 2014

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,890
you know it was 2014 so we were

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,570
obviously moving from a Python Django

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,720
monolith to go micro services because

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:14,500
that was the style at the time and it

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,300
was exciting but it also meant that our

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,279
failure states were just different like

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,370
oh no we have micro services but spoiler

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:25,480
alert all of our problems aren't gone we

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:28,839
just removed the problem around like

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:33,820
instead of you know instead of like a

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:35,860
whole bunch of IPC we we now have you

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:41,110
know network congestion is like new

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:44,589
things to worry about okay so this is a

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,690
the classic wall of confusion that it's

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,740
very common and like your your DevOps

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,899
talks you've probably seen this before

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,320
this is from Andrew clay Schafer you

00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,940
know some years back and the the idea

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,399
being that development is throwing code

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,199
over the wall to operations who's you

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,970
know presumably being pummeled by it and

00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,620
awakened at 2:45 in the morning I think

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,920
is the the timeframe that Kelsey was

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,040
telling us about and I think I would

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,880
remix the wall of confusion

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,850
[Music]

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,000
to be a little bit more like this and

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,500
because it's set up around what your

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,200
incentives look like inside your

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,360
organization and as I was mentioning

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,260
before with incentives if you have teams

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,380
that are tasked with focusing on

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,390
operability and you know reducing

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,360
downtime and MTT ours and all of those

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,950
acronyms if your teams are incentivized

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,750
around that they're going to be very

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,610
concerned when somebody wants to change

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,080
something maybe somebody wants to change

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,540
something in a really you know

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,580
disruptive way that maybe hasn't been

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,190
tested with the kind of traffic you'll

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,170
see in production also spoiler alert you

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,250
can't actually test with the traffic you

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,870
see in production until you get to

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,110
production that's why you need like

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,700
canary releases and you know a be

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,970
testing and Bluegreen deployments and

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,250
that sort of thing but okay so like

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,150
specific advice to people who are tasked

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:09,640
with operations is I know when I was you

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,560
know I was on call for production for

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,120
about 15 years which is where all the OP

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,440
cynicism comes from and I think that a

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,020
lot of times when I would tell

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,700
developers like they couldn't touch

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,680
anything they didn't like that but you

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,420
also can't just tell them good luck have

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,600
fun don't call me when you get paged

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,810
like that's not gonna help either you

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,890
need to actually produce systems that

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:37,540
are comprehensible and documented where

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,790
you've actually shared the access and

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,130
the information so that your developers

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,060
can participate in the full lifecycle of

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,250
the services and a lot of times when

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,230
people are bill to say they're

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,030
developers and maybe they're building

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,310
something with an endpoint and they're

00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,380
trying to figure out like you know how

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,150
to keep those you know instances of the

00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,620
load balancer or whatever it could be

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,800
very tempting to have the endpoint

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,120
always just return 200 okay like yes I

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,400
mean if the endpoint no it was returns

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,750
200 okay no matter what happens your

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,490
instances will definitely not get

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,290
bounced out of the load balancer they

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,890
may or may not be actually functioning

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,140
correctly so like thinking about what

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,130
your code does when it's in production

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,020
is really important especially around

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:26,020
debug ability and like the

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,750
the reality that codon production is

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,820
going to hit circumstances that might

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,730
not be that happy path that you're gonna

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:38,279
find in your earliest test cases and

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,880
what a work quick word on documentation

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,350
so no one wants to document

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,420
understandable it's kind of boring and

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,149
it does feel like anything that you

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,100
write is gonna be outdated anyway but I

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,920
would I would challenge people to make

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,410
sure that when you're at least when

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,000
you're committing the code at that

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,560
moment you probably have the most

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,350
context so if you say why not just what

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,050
the code does but why with the commit

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,700
message then someone like next year

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,070
maybe you six months later will be

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,580
sitting there angry at past you because

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,450
past you was like fixed you're like oh

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,250
that's great

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,830
that's fantastic that doesn't tell me

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,540
why you made this change that I'm now

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,940
trying to unfurl like you know the

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:30,850
dependencies of so I think we talk a lot

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,190
about like hard problems in computer

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,690
science I mean obviously like cache and

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,310
validation and naming things and

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,740
off-by-one errors right like these are

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,839
these are the hard problems and there's

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,839
a lot of a lot of jokes a lot of joke

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,140
tweets around this you know idea and I

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,100
would go with like it is actually really

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:54,790
hard to not say I'm right you're wrong

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,200
and start from a position of you want to

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,540
just argue with this person because

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,480
they're wrong and and that's I think

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,730
it's human nature it's very typical I

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,230
mean maybe not all of you maybe you're

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,819
all wonderful people who never feel this

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,100
way but it's very typical for me at

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,170
least to start from a place of

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,179
frustration why does someone else not

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,730
understand why I'm right we're back to

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,620
those human factors passed to humans but

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,569
until all of our co-workers are starting

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,439
out robots we're probably going to need

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,709
to interact with those pesky humans and

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:31,000
I think that this by the way is a 19th

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:33,280
century French publication that clearly

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,169
predicted today's video conferencing

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,690
like I think these people are trying to

00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,700
you know

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,770
use audio on a video conference and

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,180
failing horribly probably at least it

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,160
seems like every single piece of

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,810
videoconferencing software is terrible

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,890
some are less terrible than others but

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,780
they're all terrible but the idea is any

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,300
time that we're interacting with

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,440
technology we're almost always I'm not

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,790
gonna say always because there's always

00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,410
exceptions but we're almost always

00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,970
interacting with technology because we

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,610
want to do something else

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,580
we don't desperately want to find out

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,890
everything about audio-video like video

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,920
conferencing we all probably know more

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,810
about it than we want to but like it's a

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,960
means to our end of having better

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,910
communications with people so I think

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,450
it's it's really important I think to

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:24,410
Center the people part because that is a

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,780
lot more essential to our success you

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,000
know as an industry we heard from you

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,890
know people on stage this morning about

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,810
having been in the industry for like 20

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,690
years I mean yeah I've been doing this

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,610
since the 90s and I can assure you

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,810
almost every single well except for VI I

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,690
still use that every day but almost

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:45,560
every single thing that you know we used

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:50,230
regularly is different now and yet like

00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:53,360
in the industry still persists I think

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,630
this is another interplay Shafer quote

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,150
and I like this because the the kinds of

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,070
conversations that we have you know the

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,130
trends come and go the conversations ebb

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,830
and flow and I feel like we do get

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,440
really excited about you know exactly

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,260
what our pipeline looks like and it's

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,970
like okay I mean that's great but you're

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,000
going to get that code out to production

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,790
one way or another and it'll be running

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,400
in production for a lot longer then you

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,730
know that instant of deployment so like

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,650
how it actually operates in production

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,050
having some ability to answer questions

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:35,090
about your systems is also super super

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:38,150
important there's a this is from my my

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,830
spouse and I had our 20th anniversary in

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,930
March and we decided to take a trip

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,320
hiking in Iceland which I highly

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,690
recommend it's very cool but one of the

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,550
one of the things that I probably I

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,950
don't know if I would have actually

00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,930
walked on this glacier if we had gone

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,510
without a guide because if you can see

00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,240
the sign it says like attention natural

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,160
hazard cathing an unstable glacier do

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,440
not pass this point it's like wow that

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,360
sounds really dire but our guide was

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,770
able to tell us oh actually as long as

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,500
we go over here and we do this it'll be

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,930
fine and I was thinking all right how

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,060
much documentation or how many steps in

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,680
your deploy process say something where

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,620
you're like oh you can disregard that

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,180
like that's not actually true and you

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,700
don't have to worry about this specific

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,790
thing and we always skip step number 38

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,560
and it's like I think everybody works

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:31,420
someplace that has something like that

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:35,420
and it is because it is hard to

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,610
constantly update the state of all of

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,290
the other humans in a form that they'll

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,210
be able to consume on demand like that's

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,660
actually really hard these are the hard

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,880
problems so that's why I think it's

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,960
really important that we build systems

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,930
that and services that can answer ad hoc

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,600
questions on demand because we're never

00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,060
going to be able to like you know like

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,610
Kelsey was talking about in his keynote

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,860
we're never going to be able to predict

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,960
everything perfectly ahead of time like

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,280
I if you've worked in tech for at least

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,830
five minutes you probably are nodding

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,270
and thinking yeah yeah I mean unexpected

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,190
things those those horrible unknown

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,800
unknowns will always happen and it's

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,630
like having the ability to introspect

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,670
our systems is super important and like

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,310
kind of cyber on how we used to do

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,650
monitoring we basically used to do it by

00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:31,250
setting you know a certain amount of

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:35,990
like fences and parameters and like

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:39,440
trying to store or you know query the

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,930
state of I mean our discs and like our

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,060
servers and our processors and our

00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:47,330
processes and you know what the load

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,000
average looked like and trying to go

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,240
from there's a high load average to is

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,430
this an actual problem is it's

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,590
non-trivial right I mean like I used to

00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,230
you know years ago ran Hadoop clusters

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,370
and the load average was always super

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,809
high but that meant that work

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,000
getting done I didn't mean that they

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,800
were about to fall over so then you're

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,140
like okay so do I have to set some

00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,290
checks that look at it like state

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,600
changes over time I mean again like you

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,930
want the way you monitor to actually

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,559
answer questions about is work

00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:25,350
successfully getting done like if all of

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,059
our servers are somehow off and yet we

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,900
are still successfully processing

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,550
transactions

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,200
well like I mean I guess we completely

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,090
converted to server lists like we're

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,600
done you know hang a banner go home like

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:39,360
mission accomplished but the I think

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,400
it's it's a very iterative process and

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
again this is the sort of thing where if

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,820
you want to change the way the

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,880
monitoring and alerting happens in an

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,650
organization there can be a lot of

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,450
pushback especially if it's like well am

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,700
I going to get paged for these other

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,100
things that I mean if I get paged

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,140
because of a bunch of 500 errors coming

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,760
out of the application and I'm very ops

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,500
focused and I don't know what those 500

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,929
errors are I don't think I want to get

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,610
patient with those okay but let's figure

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,250
out how you can understand what they are

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,590
these this is your job like again back

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,780
to the initial value proposition of your

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,580
organization you're running those

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,630
servers for some reason probably not

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,270
just to keep a data center happily warm

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,309
alright another another thing I always

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,650
get to I always come back to is Conway's

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:28,309
law and if you're if you're not familiar

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,980
with it it's this idea that

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,720
organizations that design systems will

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,790
basically create an organization that

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,830
looks like the system the sorry that

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,630
looks like their communication structure

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,880
so they think there's there's an old

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,160
joke about something like oh you have

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,510
you know a four pass compiler

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,230
interesting so you had four different

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,690
teams on this yes and it's like well I

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,000
think that the most important word in

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,780
Conway's law is communication because

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,780
you don't necessarily need to have like

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,440
everything broken out into you know like

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,150
super tiny feature teams or whatever if

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,400
the people who need to talk to each

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:11,370
other to build the features are talking

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,380
to each other like you're your org chart

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,720
does not have to completely perfectly

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,820
match the product suite that you ship

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,799
but you do need to have communication

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,809
across the org you can't just have

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,520
everybody broken down into that's the

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,770
security team we're afraid of them

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,750
sometimes pizza goes in and like you

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,850
know anger comes out and we just try to

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,470
avoid them like if that's what you have

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,559
inside your organization you need better

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,210
communication between the teens and I

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,480
bet if you've ever tried to solve a

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,730
problem and you don't really want to

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,250
open yet another servicenow issue and

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,900
you know someone who can answer your

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,059
question and to at least help you route

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,970
to the right team like a lot of times

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,650
those cross team communications speed up

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,950
things inside organizations even though

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:59,820
if it's not the official flow of

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,140
communication but it's also there's kind

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,309
of a double-edged sword too right

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,620
because if you know Chris over in

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:11,070
operations is the one who always helps

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,370
you and then she's canoeing and doesn't

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:17,340
have any cell signal that do you like

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:19,950
not get anything done or do you have to

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,530
make friends with yet another ops person

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,380
or what if somebody like you know gets a

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,539
super exciting new job at you know a

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,850
competitor and leaves it's like there's

00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,500
a lot of reasons that you don't want to

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,780
just have all the communication inside

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,980
the organization rest on whether or not

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,530
you know Chris is happy with you today

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,700
so I think it's it's important I know

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,549
this is kind of an eye chart and I'll

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,230
put the slides online afterwards but in

00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:49,500
this one there's also you can see it at

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,990
design hacks Co and I like this chart

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,159
because it talks about cognitive biases

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:58,890
and when we're trying to get that

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,870
shortest path to an answer when we're

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,460
trying to solve a problem inside our

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,200
organization when we're trying to find

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,730
that one person who's going to be able

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,720
to short-circuit things for us so that

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,970
we can get to our goals that much faster

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,120
we're taking it in processing

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,950
information and coming to conclusions

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
really quickly the way the human brain

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,149
works is like it's a really interesting

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,940
hack but the way it works is we have

00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:29,250
significantly less like you know logical

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,560
processing than we might think we have

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,620
we take a lot of shortcuts we take

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,330
shortcuts in order to be able to come to

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,740
conclusions quickly and we take

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:42,630
shortcuts to like not be eaten by a

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,690
saber-toothed tiger and this is all like

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,590
deep-seated evolutionary stuff that also

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,300
unfortunately leads to actual like

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,600
biases and outcomes and biases in how we

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:58,670
interact with people I mean I can I can

00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,320
give an example like at one point I was

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,150
running a team of operations engineers

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,710
we were called Simmons then because you

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,470
know it was the early 2000s but like

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,010
running a team and our uncles were kind

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,240
of strenuous mostly because we had a

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,310
data center in the basement of a hundred

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,960
year old library and sometimes the

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,090
building would flood and sometimes our

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,440
water-cooled doors would stop working

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,060
because they were pumps would stop

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,890
sending us chilled water and it was a

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,440
whole thing and they this was a there

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,850
were supercomputers / tip you do not

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,090
want your supercomputers to overheat

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,100
because that's very bad and so like we

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,840
had a pretty bad on-call rotation and we

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,880
had a developer offer to join the

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,400
on-call rotation because I think he was

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,170
really sick of like there was no get

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,910
installed on the supercomputers and I

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,580
just told him to use SVN because I was

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,440
that way I was terrible but um so he

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,450
said oh hey if I can get you know wrote

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,490
on those supercomputers like I would be

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,350
in the on-call rotation with you I said

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,610
no to that looking back I'm like that

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,290
was so foolish that would have been

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,850
another person than the rotation another

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,990
week before I would have to be on call

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:03,000
again and because I had that like you

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,730
know human hindbrain like leaping to

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,710
enemy that developers an enemy cannot

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,630
give enemy route it's like you know what

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,630
everything is a lot more nuanced than

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,610
that but sometimes when you're when

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,950
you're making those shortcut decisions

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,150
like you don't you're trying to act

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,390
quickly and you're not necessarily

00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:24,630
acting right so all right so what do we

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:27,270
do about that I think if any of you

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,100
remember the left pad incident a lot of

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,980
this if you don't remember it last year

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,920
there was an NPM module that basically

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,950
led to a huge amount of outages when

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,750
there was a problem with it and when

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,659
we're coming ratcheting right back to

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,479
the communication around our

00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:47,309
and around our availability like we do

00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:49,919
own it ourselves we have to take

00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,029
responsibility for it that does mean if

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,429
we need to share that responsibility

00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,070
with people communicating with them and

00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:59,340
documenting for them so like we have to

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,409
invest in you know like our architecture

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,099
obviously so it's not a complete

00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:04,289
disaster

00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,970
and our observability so that we can

00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:09,840
introspect and ask questions about our

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,269
architecture and there's a friend of

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,590
mine is doing a startup called honeycomb

00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:15,210
by the way I thought you should totally

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,789
check out honeycomb data i/o is all

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,679
about observability tooling but and then

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,720
also like a culture where we're willing

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,979
to talk to each other about these

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,509
problems so like basically I get really

00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:28,619
frustrated I've been working at a vendor

00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:30,570
for the last couple of years I just

00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,399
switched from pivotal to Microsoft but I

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,340
would be in a lot of meetings where

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,019
people really wanted to talk about you

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,789
know their DevOps initiative because

00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,690
they were definitely gonna do DevOps and

00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:44,039
in q3 this year and I'm like uh-huh okay

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,749
we're not gonna be able to lure that to

00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,570
you on a kind of not a thing

00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:50,220
but you can't no matter how many

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,369
containers you have they are not going

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,799
to give you DevOps and like you should

00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:57,149
probably keep grain in your silos and

00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,659
not the different members of your

00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:04,349
organization because that silos by the

00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:06,629
way fun fact the grain dust in silos is

00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:08,340
highly combustible so they're very

00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:11,729
dangerous your organization could

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,039
explode if you had silos and also like

00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:15,749
hey I work at a cloud provider now but I

00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,970
still have to tell you when people tell

00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:19,919
you that their exciting initiative to

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,179
repair all of the communication problems

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,099
inside their organization that are

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,830
leading to deployment slowdowns is to go

00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,269
to the cloud and you're like ha you've

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,249
realized those are someone else's

00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:31,499
computers but we're still gonna have

00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:33,239
whole - same problems we had before it's

00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,979
like it's like when people have server

00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:37,349
lists and it's like okay that's cool you

00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:39,599
have computers you can't necesito this

00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,950
did not solve the part about how the you

00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,470
know change control Review Board is

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:49,950
angry at you like it's not gonna solve

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:52,169
those things so I think we get really we

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,380
feel blocked by looking at all of these

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,240
especially if we're at an organism

00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,680
that is trying to make all of the

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,500
changes and update and change all the

00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,470
things and it seems like it's really

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,990
difficult and there's so much new tech

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,640
coming up every day and you're like how

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,500
many clusters of what do we need to

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,080
orchestrate and this seems like we have

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,640
a lot we have to do all of a sudden by

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,770
the way this was I took this on Lake

00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,950
Superior that's my spouse standing there

00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,500
looking at the frozen wall and I'm

00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:25,340
standing out on the frozen lake so a

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,980
couple years ago but I literally turned

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,840
just a little bit and instead of us

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,750
having to climb that wall we could just

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,130
walk around it it's like Andrew Claire

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,050
shaver likes to say people over

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,880
processes over tools and that's

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,770
basically hey look there's a little

00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,330
person in there look where other look

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,400
where the other people are clever and

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:48,020
cooperate with them it gets a lot easier

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,930
it really really does and that's the the

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,070
DevOps magic you're you don't buy it and

00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,420
you're not going to get it in a box

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,550
unless you get it in this box of

00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,100
chocolates which were delicious

00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,570
DevOps days Belgium 2014 they were

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,610
speaker guess it's like YUM

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,800
but other than that like you're not

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,450
going to get this magically sold to you

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,370
or handed to you by anyone but you

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,230
definitely can create it by

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,130
collaborating across your teams so

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,710
that's it

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:17,589
I'll check happy to talk Thanks

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,589
