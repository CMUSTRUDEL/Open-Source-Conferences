	00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,660
because I know you're probably wondering

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,820
what is a marketing person doing kicking

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,860
off this conference right all things

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,179
open and if I were you I'd have exactly

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,700
the same question you know yeah

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,190
the reality though is I've only just

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,170
recently became CMO at Red Hat

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,109
I've been 37 years in the software

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,240
industry I'm sort of the living history

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,250
lesson for what really happened at the

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,439
beginning of open-source long before it

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,199
was called that so what I wanted to do

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,940
today is just take you back and look at

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,910
how we got here I mean look at this room

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,070
right 3300 people you look at the state

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,980
of open-source now beyond just

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,100
technology into methodology into culture

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,329
changes impacting all manner of human

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,700
endeavor and it's pretty extraordinary

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,770
but I thought it'd be worth giving a

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,000
little bit of a reverent perspective on

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,410
how we got here and that's what I'd like

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,590
to do in a very short period of time

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,940
today so the way we're going to start is

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,250
just by reminding you how much

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,719
open-source is around us every single

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,220
day how much we're interacting with

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,600
open-source so the crack video team at

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,970
Red Hat took a team to document a week

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,520
in the life of one of our hard-charging

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,619
no-nonsense executives as they were

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,250
preparing for a major business trip to

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,670
Asia and you know we actually started

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,770
first looking at getting ready by

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,680
getting an early morning you know double

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,220
expresso at Starbucks Starbucks as it

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,470
turns out has done major work in

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,659
automation using open source they have

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,150
an open agronomy project which is all

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,520
about how to share best practices around

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,430
growing beans and those sorts of things

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,710
so and the morning of that trip that

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,780
hard-charging executive went to get his

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:55,649
double expresso or maybe a fruity drink

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,420
and a selfie so next thing had to get

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,890
something to eat by the way the the

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,119
documentary team was my wife and

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,570
daughter so I should just admit that

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,820
upfront so next we went to Chili's to

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,860
grab you know just a healthy snack and

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,509
and you know Chili's as it turns out and

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,209
Brinker's the parent company for

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,440
Brentford chilies and Maggiano's

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,240
although the entire customer

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,550
you'll experience that you see from the

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,840
web to the restaurants themselves and

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,480
the little kiosks let's have the desk

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,620
all open-source so pretty extraordinary

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,180
so getting ready for that trip eating

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,210
healthy you know just having a little

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,240
nosh okay maybe it was ribs and

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,130
margaritas this unlike Starbucks this

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,390
was not breakfast so this was later in

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,840
the day

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,000
next up had to get some supplies I was a

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,270
little low on on office supplies gonna

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,920
work the whole flight to Japan so I made

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,090
a little trip to target targets really

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,120
interesting I was very fortunate

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,580
actually true story to kokino to Gartner

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
conference with Elvan Loomis who was the

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,420
chief architect that drove targets

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,460
entire digital transformation amazing

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,940
story going from 1,800 brick-and-mortar

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,440
stores to a full-on digital property

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,670
today and so I just went to get some

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,450
office supplies and maybe some snacks

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,970
too for the plane by the way if you ever

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,500
actually try to ride one of these the

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,110
when you put him in Reverse it's like

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,180
120 decibel beep and everybody looks at

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,260
you so trying to be discreet and not

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,230
getting caught taking this picture

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,480
didn't work so so that was targeted so

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,510
now it's time to travel

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,140
I personally fly United just have all my

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,820
life but you know every major airline

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,370
every major airline in the fortune 500

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,770
in fact uses open source every day from

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,489
you know you know the electronic systems

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,140
to infotainment and the like so you know

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,800
I get my plan to do a whole trip just

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,660
getting some work done and well maybe a

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,739
couple glasses of wine I had to take a

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,680
little nap in between so but can I say

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,820
me a question I just somebody asked him

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,830
do this before in those kids pictures

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,670
does the fella to the next to me look

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,940
like an air marshal to anybody because

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,850
he never said a word he never drank and

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,370
he never slept so I was a little

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,870
suspicious but the tip-off was when he

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,370
dragged me off the plane after taking

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,359
this picture that was a night and then I

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,830
knew so I heard a so let's let's get a

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,410
little serious and talk about how we got

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,060
here so you know open source has been

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,000
around in some form or another since

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,000
long before the term was coined in 1998

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,070
and I was fortunate in my career to have

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,900
gone through you know I came up through

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,150
the ranks and UNIX and distributed

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,550
computing and I just like to give you

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,500
some of the perspective that I I have

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,920
and how it relates to how we got here in

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,660
this room today but we'll do it in a

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,040
slightly irreverent way not that we

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,840
haven't been doing that already but just

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,900
to give you some of the interesting

00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,160
anecdotes and sort of sidebars that you

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,810
know you don't see in all the books okay

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,570
maybe I went back a little too early in

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,570
history this was I think this is my

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,490
first marketing job actually so let's

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,960
look at a little bit more of the history

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,980
so let's start with 1989 I had already

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,950
been working for a Digital Equipment

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,550
Corporation was since bought by Compaq

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,470
and compact sense by HP but Dec as it

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,900
was known was a technology tour-de-force

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,180
I grew up in product management and what

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,350
was interesting about deck and and it's

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,180
its roots were in open collaboration at

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,340
MIT a lot of the leadership team came

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,110
from MIT doing the first generation of

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,210
computers we just worked hand in glove

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,000
with with MIT and particularly I was on

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,160
ultimately in 1989 I went to the UNIX

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,350
group to run product management product

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,120
marketing and it was just a matter of

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,010
course we were working on numerous

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,110
projects with MIT with other

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,340
universities and by virtue of the MIT

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,770
Media Lab with other competitors so we

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,320
had actually had just as a matter of

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,360
course a rhythm in terms of how to

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,100
collaborate typically through

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,070
universities initially with other

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,200
companies that was one interesting and

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,510
and I progressed through the ranks I

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,910
want it being vice president GM of

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,580
basically UNIX all their systems

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,800
software networking so I had I got a

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,600
pretty good perspective and you know was

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,130
actually part of championing efforts

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,860
that were happening around you know

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,450
standardization and motif and things

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,740
that were happening in distribute

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,600
computing technologies at the time like

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,050
DCE the other interesting thing about

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,510
that team at digital is the folks that

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,650
invented Red Hat Enterprise Linux or in

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,290
my group in that day so

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,060
that you you may know like Brian Stevens

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,560
and Tim Burke they were the two guys

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,850
that actually wrote the first version of

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,210
Enterprise Linux in Tim Burke's

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,090
garage and here we are today you know

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:56,570
into our seventh major release built an

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,340
extraordinary company so they're

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,289
starting to see the good side of

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,610
collaboration and and and particularly

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,130
leveraging the work at was going to MIT

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,650
I mentioned I then became vice president

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,360
general manager right at the time that

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,199
what we referred to in those days as the

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,690
UNIX worse were playing out started with

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,970
ATT suing Berkeley over the Berkeley

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,830
standard distribution and so everybody

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,800
factionalized right so all the companies

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,590
that were privatizing a UNIX variant my

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,510
team was productizing first a bsd

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,000
distribution and eventually Mach

00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,669
microkernel from Carnegie Mellon which

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,860
was still BSD licensed and others were

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,099
on system five and it just created chaos

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,720
there were competing foundations built

00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,060
you know but everybody knew it was

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,229
dooming us like every vendor team in

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,260
fact we'd have we'd go through these

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,789
cycles of creating yet a new forum to

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,960
try to rationalize these things and you

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,530
can look back in history and some of

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,250
these things cosy common open a software

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,940
environment spec 1170 it was there was

00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,620
really an attempt to standardize 1170

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,270
api's in the operating system so you

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,430
could get a high degree of sort of some

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,370
binary compatibility they all failed but

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,680
it was at the time where other open

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,590
source licenses were starting to come on

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,900
the scene other ways to collaborate so

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,889
it wasn't for want of trying we just

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,690
weren't figuring it out in this point

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,440
eventually I want a bet at compact a

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:26,479
compact was acquired Dec and in 1998 I

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,360
was responsible for all the enterprise

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,949
software elements of their business and

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,820
this is a time where UNIX had

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,500
fundamentally lost the mid tier we were

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,250
we had we had focused I was told it on a

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,419
64-bit a high-end platform so my job was

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,240
to figure out how we balanced our

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,470
requirements in the mid market and

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,850
Windows NT was really the only other

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,240
alternative so I started to look for

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,540
other things that might be an effective

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,430
alternative and I knew all these folk

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,980
said had gone to company called Red Hat

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,600
and they were working on Linux and I got

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,940
really intrigued about the possibility

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,610
of Linux being a mid mid tier

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,399
alternative to being totally dependent

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,209
on Windows NT as a company and so

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,769
reached out got to know Bob Young who

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,110
was the founder of course Matthews ooh

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,829
look at the time and I actually led

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,810
compaq's strategic equity investment in

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,360
Red Hat pre IPO so I knew Red Hat when

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,940
it was 60 people and very little money

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,209
and I can remember I had to go to

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,060
compacts Board of Directors to present

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,620
what why I wanted to do this and Ben

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,089
Rosen who was one of the world's first

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,089
venture capitalists he was the chairman

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,470
of the board at compact he I got all

00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,660
done making my pitch why this is so

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,410
strategically important and he literally

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,819
said to me

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,100
gee will cheat him this all sounds

00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:48,980
interesting but they just sell free

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,079
software right and how many times have

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,970
you heard that in your lives right he

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,589
was the first one who asked me he said

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,980
well how do they make money and I said

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:00,350
gee I don't really know but they sell a

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,209
lot of hats pens and t-shirts so I think

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,329
that's I think that's the business model

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,829
of the future which is why Ben Rosen was

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,350
a venture capitalist and why I'm still

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:11,810
working for a living and they drink so

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,089
that was pretty interesting time because

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,069
I got to see you know the amazing things

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,350
that started to play out around Red Hat

00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,880
and then Enterprise Linux in the middle

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,610
of that I left I went to a company

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,980
called a layer a layer cold fusion if

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,899
you see CFM's on the on the web that's

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,490
what was a cold fusion web pages we

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,560
really was the world's first app server

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,440
and then we acquired a company called J

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,060
run which was our first j2e app server

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,680
so I became very engaged and in the

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,089
whole Java community what was happening

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,019
with the jes back actually met a fellow

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,870
where we're trying to a collaboration

00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:52,189
from blue stone named Bob Bickle Bob

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,060
went on to become CTO of JBoss so in

00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:55,250
that timeframe

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,170
reddit Enterprise Linux was released

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,170
sort of change the game pretty

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,360
dramatically and pretty quickly I got so

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,340
excited that I aligned up coming to Red

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,520
Hat several years later in 2005

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,690
as what amounted to be our first chief

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,850
marketing officer although at that time

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,580
all the businesses and product lines and

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,190
everything were in that role so I was

00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,750
still doing basically product management

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,790
but one of the things I learned it's

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,980
coming in was we lacked the middleware

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,900
strategy but really needed to build one

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,690
so we need to expand beyond our pure

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,480
platform base so right away I started to

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,070
champion the cause of expanding from

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,100
what fledgling things the company was

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:39,210
doing to acquiring JBoss which we did in

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,600
fact this picture as a few months after

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,990
the acquisition of JBoss we acquired up

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,380
for 350 million dollars at the time on

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,450
the very left of your screen is our

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,700
general counsel Michael Cunningham the

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,490
gentleman next to him is Mark flurry who

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,020
was the founder and CEO of JBoss mark as

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,690
you see his pictures trying to hip check

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,040
Michael off the podium apparently three

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,560
hundred and fifty million may have not

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,000
have been enough but you know it was

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
pretty interesting time and that was an

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,990
extraordinary acquisition in the open

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,240
source space in the day it's going on to

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,150
be a successful business force so just

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,700
moving forward a little bit I had I been

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,670
a CEO once before and I got the itch to

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,380
go do it again and the company I worked

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,510
for went to work for was company called

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,800
Black Duck software and I was always

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,360
intrigued by them right at was an

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,690
investor right I mean this is this is a

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,270
small world story if if there ever was

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,640
one so I was intrigued by the company

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,170
not because of what they were doing but

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,120
because of the technology had built they

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,770
were doing automated open-source license

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,620
compliance but I always thought that if

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,810
you applied that capability far upstream

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,760
in the development process and used it

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,560
to drive adoption and enablement that

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,910
would be a much more powerful story and

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,670
so fundamentally I went to the company

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,530
to do that pivot and it was awesome and

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,610
in fact over the course of those years

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,860
we wound up having incredible

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,240
conversations with customers who were

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,280
now starting to think about not just

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,660
using open source technology and

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,390
development which we were trying to

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,820
enable but also how to apply open source

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,960
style development methods to what they

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,280
were doing internally open source

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,560
processes how do you even bring open

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,040
source culture into bear and apply it

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,570
internally what

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,850
I think Jim GL skis going to talk about

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,920
in terms of inner sourcing right this

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,570
was inner sourcing it still is today the

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,329
notion of companies bringing open source

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,399
technologies and methods and culture

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,420
inside to make themselves more agile as

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,820
part of their agile development process

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,120
so I got I got a deep deep exposure to

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,829
that from 2009 to when I came back to

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,920
Red Hat in 2014

00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:43,420
talk to more CIOs about how there could

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,699
change their development environments

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,550
and cultures than any time in my history

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:51,250
so now I have a sort of a full notion of

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:55,740
how powerful this can be came back to

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:58,180
red at 2014 did a couple of acquisitions

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,040
you know and the company was screaming

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,779
because now we're serving you have

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,000
multiple capabilities but we're also

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,740
having these conversations with you know

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,019
customers and potential customers around

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,300
how their cultures can evolve and how

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,620
they can take advantage of open not just

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,509
an open source software and and

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,620
licensing but in this much broader

00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:19,930
dimension and in that timeframe

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,529
Red Hat screamed to be a two billion

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,639
dollar company and I had been there for

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:30,040
a couple years

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:34,420
coincidence only the Red Hatters laughed

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,670
at that okay and then in 2017 a couple

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,459
things happened we made it to the global

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:42,069
2000 so in Red Hat is a global 2000

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:45,010
company now and I was asked by Jim

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:47,139
Whitehurst to step into the marketing

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,199
role and I was I was extremely excited

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:51,970
because I think this is a role in a

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,819
company from which we can really

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,399
evangelize open source as a movement as

00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:59,260
as a way of collaborating that

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,079
transcends software transcends

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,720
technologies but has a major potential

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,069
to have real cultural impact I mean

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,930
that's and that was fundamentally why I

00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:10,779
said yes to this role although I will

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,850
tell you my technical colleagues in Red

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,040
Hat all of a sudden treated me like I

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,100
dropped 20 IQ points when I made that

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,060
job change okay yeah one less quick

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,939
slide went metaphorically this is taken

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,800
at a conference in China and open source

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,220
conference in China I've been very

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,820
fortunate to work with some of the best

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,850
minds in open-source many of them are

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,100
here today in this picture you can see

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,490
you know Dirk handle you can see Jim's

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,110
Emlyn Mark Shuttleworth next to me but

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,240
there's number and many many I don't

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,640
have the time to go through them all but

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,200
it's been extraordinary to work with

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,360
them and looking in this past and I sort

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,740
of see myself as like the Forrest Gump

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,090
of open source you know I wound up at

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,420
all these really interesting points in

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:59,050
history I'm not really sure why that but

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,490
yeah that's all I got to say about that

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,980
ok so I'm a little behind so I'm going

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,710
to go very quickly just on where we are

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,320
today you know open sources everywhere

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,970
you know mark driver at Gartner 95

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,280
percent of companies you know

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,110
non-trivial use of open source which I

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,610
guess means the other five use trivial

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,700
open source but it's still a pretty

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,870
significant statistic no matter what and

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,060
its use is growing you know growing

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,080
pretty dramatically in all companies

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,380
even the ones that don't know they're

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,720
using it so just some statistics you

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,250
know it transcends apps transcends you

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,030
know app development infrastructure and

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,190
networking you name it and it's becoming

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,990
part of how companies do business

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,700
whether or not that technology companies

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,500
they're participating more and more in

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,860
these communities and so open-source

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,840
itself has become the font of virtually

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,000
all original innovation in software it

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,580
moved from early days when I started

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,680
creating low-cost replicas of commercial

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,290
software to now being the heart of how

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,960
technology is innovated but it's more

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,460
interest technology it's how processes

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,830
in collaboration and culture are

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,199
innovated too and as I said starting to

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,250
transcend all manner of human endeavor

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,320
well beyond just technology so one one

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,360
or two last points look at where we are

00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,680
today and how open-source is impacting

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,410
things like artificial intelligence

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,089
self-driving cars immersive experiences

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,730
you know virtual reality augmented

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,579
reality the the range of digital

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,370
platforms that were able to engage on

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,500
and now it's adding to impact other

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:35,000
elements of humanity like healthcare

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,820
like agriculture like education like art

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,680
and in fact if we can pull this off just

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,050
like to show you a very short video of

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,350
how open source is being applied to the

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,350
arts

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:54,090
must be playing off of my lavell ear mic

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,260
I guess alright well let's see I think

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,030
in the interest of time I'll skip that

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,650
that the story was is about Tate Modern

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,900
the museum very famous Museum in London

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,520
they actually have a exhibit now where

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,010
there's nothing in the room except

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,680
tables and chairs and a piece of paper

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,440
to suggest a topic that people might

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,300
collaborate on and just just attendees

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,580
to the museum sit down and start talking

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:23,550
and here you go on their phones

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,750
head down they're not talking to no more

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:31,980
you can get anybody this is the

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:35,730
commodity that we losing out on time and

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,060
space real human exchange is getting

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,060
sidelined

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,780
when people Vance comes into the testers

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,800
chain they look lost then I don't know

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,060
where to go don't know what to do

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,270
I came here I had no idea what to expect

00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,910
been to this way yeah by a minute or and

00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:00,010
we see what's going on and just say just

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,140
come in for just for five minutes and I

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:06,240
had a look around there was a table with

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,520
some people so we're doing it people

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,740
want a space where they can be more

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:18,880
active not part of something I really

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,830
didn't know if this is an experiment you

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,390
would people do it but they come and sit

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,600
down at this table would they give of

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,600
themselves

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,470
people can get to know each other in a

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,640
new way

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,330
go into the unknown

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:50,599
before put or great wooden table

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:50,599
[Music]

00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:00,750
okay so just to wrap up here out of time

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,870
but I wanted to end by thanking all of

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:08,010
you so this is a corner of the industry

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:10,860
that I've spent my complete professional

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,960
life in 37 years we've got something

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,140
amazing going on here it's now impacting

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,390
as I said healthcare agriculture you

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,020
name it emergency responses in

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,000
hurricanes and earthquakes so we've got

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,640
