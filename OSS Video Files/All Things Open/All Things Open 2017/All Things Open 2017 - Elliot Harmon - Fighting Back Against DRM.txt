a lot of reasons one of them is that I'm

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,660
not a technologist and there are I would

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,450
venture to say that probably everybody

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,010
in this room has more technical

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,599
knowledge than I do so I'm looking

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,269
forward to this discussion with you and

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,330
the questions that you might have even

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,340
as I may not be able to answer them my

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,670
name is Elliot Harmon and I am with the

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,080
Electronic Frontier Foundation raise

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,710
your hand if you have not heard of the

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,470
EFS let's try that a few people good

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,110
thank you so much for coming when people

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,840
ask me what is I usually say it is a

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,899
digital rights organization which always

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,030
leads to the question what are digital

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,250
rights and the answer to that question

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,039
is there's no such thing as digital

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,920
rights it is a made-up term there are

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,699
only your rights your right to freedom

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,170
of speech freedom of expression privacy

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,530
your your right to freedom of religion

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,570
your right to assembly and those rights

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,160
should not change whether you're talking

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,880
about the internet or you're talking

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,979
about meatspace or something in between

00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,110
however as technology develops and

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,530
changes there are always forces out

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,920
there arguing that when technology moves

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,200
your rights need to be relitigated that

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,750
for example because end-to-end

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,350
encryption exists you should no longer

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,900
have your right to privacy or that

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,670
because Police Department's now have

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,520
very sophisticated surveillance

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,340
technologies that they can use to track

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,320
you or your movements around a city that

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,920
you should no longer have your right to

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,140
due process and EF F is the organization

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,659
saying no your rights are your rights

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,780
and they should not change when

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,640
technology changes and we have a number

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,290
of different venues in which we defend

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,079
your rights we do quite a bit of

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,030
litigation but we also do a lot of work

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,439
outside of the courts and I'm one of the

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,509
people in the organization who works

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,090
outside of the courts I talked to

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,950
lawmakers and policymakers urging them

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,190
to protect your rights

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,709
in in laws and policies I spend a lot of

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,319
time talking to EF F members talking to

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,590
people like that like the folks

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,170
this room urging you to write and call

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,150
your members of Congress and and to get

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,760
involved in other ways in defense of

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,439
your rights online oh I forgot there's a

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,989
little piece of housekeeping that I'm

00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,180
supposed to do the organizers of this

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,310
one and everybody to read a couple of

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,180
rules I don't know the specifics

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,310
apparently there were some problems

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,019
yesterday so they just wanted all of the

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,780
speaker's today to reiterate a couple of

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,340
rules the first rule is that a robot may

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,709
not injure a human being or through

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,400
inaction a lie they allow a human being

00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:51,109
to come to harm the second rule is that

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,269
a robot must obey orders given to it by

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:56,900
human beings except where such orders

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,939
would conflict with the first law and

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,709
the final rule is that a robot must

00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,469
protect its own existence as long as

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,389
such protection does not conflict with

00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:06,769
the first or second law is there any

00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:08,030
question about these rules and can

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,699
everybody kind of agree to follow these

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,500
rules for the rest of the day okay good

00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:15,019
obviously this is a silly joke I've been

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,900
reading Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,790
Robotics but I brought those up for a

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,829
specific reason because I think that

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,680
they're very very pertinent to this

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:28,310
discussion in particular that second law

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,379
that robots must obey humans and indeed

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,040
that question of whether the machines

00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:37,519
that we own should do what we tell them

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:44,239
to is really the central question in the

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,739
debate over DRM DRM stands depending

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,180
whom you ask for digital rights

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,509
management or digital restrictions

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,790
management and I think it's useful to

00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:56,439
spend a couple of moments explaining

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,579
what I mean when I use that phrase DRM

00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,769
because I think that what a lot of

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:03,739
people picture when they hear that term

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,409
is a piece of the pie but it's actually

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,799
a very small piece of the pie so yes

00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:13,639
when we talk about DRM we are talking

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:17,299
about things like the old iTunes Fair

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:19,099
Play system that sought to prevent you

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,529
from putting the music that you bought

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:25,690
on more than a certain number of devices

00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:28,360
or to play it at all on on devices that

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,310
Apple did not approve of or they're

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,220
thinking of things things like DVD

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,410
encryption that seeks to prevent people

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,050
from ripping copies of a movie on their

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,990
computers or making a copy of those DVDs

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,210
this sort of DRM in what you might kind

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,980
of think of as traditional digital media

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,530
is certainly a big part of the

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,690
discussion in DRM but it's not all we're

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,880
talking about and I would argue that

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,710
this is actually a decreasing size of

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,890
the pie because this is an area in which

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,540
the rights holders have kind of given up

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,190
when we talk about DRM today we're

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,050
talking about things like this

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,350
we're talking about farm machinery

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,510
having locks on it preventing farmers

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,610
from doing maintenance and repairs on it

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,550
or preventing them from taking it to an

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,560
independent repair shop essentially

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,060
bricking a tractor if somebody besides

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,270
the certified a repair technician

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,710
attempts to repair it we're talking

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,260
about things like this we're talking

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,630
about medical devices and researchers

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,300
being blocked from these locking

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,210
technologies from conducting research on

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,500
flaws in these medical devices flaws

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,990
that could potentially be deadly and

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,930
we're talking about our ability to hold

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,180
manufacturers accountable we're talking

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,780
about locks that prevented researchers

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,000
from checking Volkswagens work with its

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,940
emission tests and determining whether

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,320
Volkswagen was lying to the public so

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,260
that's the kind of thing that I mean

00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,830
when I talk about DRM I mean not just

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,480
with iTunes or ebooks or media like that

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,370
but I'm talking about any attempt that a

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,490
manufacturer of a of a piece of media or

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,470
a piece of technology uses to place a

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,230
kind of artificial limit on its

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,690
functionality to draw a line between

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,990
what the user of this product is allowed

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:28,680
to do with that product and what she is

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:33,720
not allowed to do and DRM in our opinion

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,040
puts a stifle on innovation and down

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,129
lawful and innovative and experimental

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,729
and exciting and creative you

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,279
of Technology and incidentally does a

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,589
very poor job of locking up the things

00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,409
that it is supposedly intended to lock

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:52,080
up and it's easy when you think about it

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,589
for a few minutes to understand why DRM

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,669
is not very effective at for example

00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:01,469
keeping movies off of the Internet it's

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,399
because of what is sometimes referred to

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:09,149
as the smartest cow problem I do not

00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,909
actually know how to hack the DRM on a

00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,999
DVD I don't know how to do that but

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:21,059
other people certainly do and so I don't

00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:24,330
need to if there is one cow that is

00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:26,580
smart enough to unlock the lock on your

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,369
gate then it doesn't matter how high

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,329
your fence is all of the cows are going

00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:35,519
to get out and so DRM is not only

00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,939
ineffective and it is not just a bad

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:42,509
idea but it is unfortunately a bad idea

00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,729
that has been written into the law under

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,769
the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:49,860
Act does everybody here familiar with

00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,969
the DMCA I assume most people are I'm

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,179
guessing the main way you're familiar

00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,709
with it is when you see things that have

00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,959
been removed from the internet because

00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,729
of takedown requests the notice and

00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,249
takedown regime is one of the big parts

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,279
of the DMCA that has caused a lot of

00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,559
kind of trouble over the years but

00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,729
another thing that the DMCA did is it

00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:13,559
put the force of copyright law behind

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:18,360
digital locks so here's the relevant

00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:21,809
text it says no person cell sure no

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,539
person shall circumvent a technological

00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:27,409
measure that effectively controls access

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:30,240
to a work protected under this title

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:33,810
now let's unpack that a little bit where

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,569
this sentence appears is in this is in

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,120
the US federal statute relevant to

00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:41,849
copyright law and so when you see that

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,769
phrase a work protected under this title

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,750
you understand that it's not just

00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,959
talking about music and movies and

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,910
things like that but it is also talking

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:57,730
about software as software as

00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:00,460
no is copyrightable and so what that law

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:04,210
does is it allows manufacturers to

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,880
create these locks preventing any use

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,820
that they don't like of a certain piece

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,730
of of a piece of technology that they

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,860
offer with the force of criminal law

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:18,910
behind it and I want to be clear when I

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,640
say that 1201 makes circumventing DRM

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,380
illegal I don't just mean that it breaks

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,140
the Terms of Service or that it voids

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,580
your warranty or or that avoid some kind

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,690
of contract you have with the

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,480
manufacturer

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,970
I mean illegally illegal with the

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,560
potential for both civil and criminal

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,660
liability I've been talking a lot

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,180
recently with a colleague of mine Cory

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,490
Doctorow who who is a very well known

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,960
and very well respected author I'm

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,420
guessing most of you are familiar with

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,160
his work if you're not you should be he

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,840
and I were talking about DRM the other

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,670
day and he pointed something out to me

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,650
that I'd never really thought about it

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:04,090
in quite these terms before when you see

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:06,160
these icons on a computer screen you

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,120
understand that they're not referring to

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,460
literal objects when you click on that

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,920
scissor icon you do not believe that

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,260
there is actually a literal pair of

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,580
scissors inside your computer cutting

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,710
something out software is built on many

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,350
many layers of abstraction between

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,280
what's literally going on in the machine

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,290
and what's going on in the users brain

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,670
and I like talking with a crowd of geeky

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,500
people like this because you guys

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,680
understand those layers of abstraction

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,310
and so you understand when you look at

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,550
this thing that yes this thing is a rice

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,880
cooker but it is not only a rice cooker

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:51,250
it is also a computer and so there are

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,190
things you can do with this computer

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,080
that the manufacturer of this computer

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,650
calling itself a rice cooker would have

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,190
never imagined similarly when you look

00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,730
at this object you understand

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,730
that it is not only an automobile it is

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,220
more importantly a computer and so there

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,260
are things you can do with this computer

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,620
that the manufacturer would have never

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,990
imagined or approved of and indeed there

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,300
are risks that come with using this

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,220
computer that do not come with those

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,040
other machines that look a lot like this

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,730
computer and you all you all understand

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,130
that now we are in this weird situation

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,410
where treating the rice cooker like the

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,590
computer that it is and treating the car

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,790
like the computer than it is is

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:44,960
potentially illegal the law shouldn't

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,960
protect metaphors

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,910
there is fortunately some recourse and

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,190
that's because the Copyright Office runs

00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,360
this process whereby the public can

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:03,660
officially request exceptions to DMCA

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,140
1201 this takes place in a process that

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,990
happens every three years it takes about

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,790
a year to put your case together for why

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,950
you should get this exception from the

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,380
Copyright Office and then it takes the

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,390
Copyright Office about another year to

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,520
to decide whether to grant that

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,590
exception and this is a process that

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,210
takes place every three years so you can

00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:29,540
put the math together and see that this

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:31,710
is really an around-the-clock job we

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,200
requested we're just at the beginning of

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,690
this process right now last time around

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:42,680
we requested and were granted four

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,680
really important exceptions to DMCA 1201

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,740
the first of those has to do with car

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,990
security research repair and

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,400
modifications this is exactly the kind

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,990
of thing we were talking about earlier

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,420
and exactly the kind of thing that came

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,950
up in a high profile story where there

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,250
were a KERS that figured out how to

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,230
drive these cars around remotely so this

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,200
is an exception specifically for

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,570
research on security and safety issues

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,610
so it's certainly not talking about like

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,350
customization for people's you know

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,540
entertainment or enjoyment or a better

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,360
driving experience it's really talking

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,840
specifically about security and and and

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,100
safety of those automobiles the second

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,220
one of these this was actually an

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,310
expansion a couple of cycles ago we got

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,160
jailbreaking for mobile phones this past

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,100
time the exception for mobile phones was

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,260
extended another three years and they

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,780
added to that tablets and some kind of

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,780
similar devices in the tablet category I

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,680
know

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,990
third is archiving and preserving

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,140
videogames this one is a little bit

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,940
obtuse but I'm guessing that in this

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,870
room full of nerds there will be a bunch

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,770
of people who understand this

00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:01,310
there are certain video games that you

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:04,190
can only play if when you first open it

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,890
up you can connect to this remote server

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:10,279
to identify that you have an official

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,740
copy of that video game the problem that

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,160
happens is when at some point that

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,170
server is taken offline the the video

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,020
game becomes for all intents and

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,060
purposes worthless and so we got this

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,450
very narrowly defined exception

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,850
specifically for games that no longer

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,270
have their core functionality when that

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,700
server goes down bypassing DRM for the

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,950
purposes of restoring that functionality

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,350
so this is really narrowly tailored and

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,240
it's not addressing a lot of they're

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,770
really kind of cool other customization

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,450
things that people do with video games

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,540
but it is an important exception

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,150
nonetheless and the fourth one of these

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,210
is remix invideo x' from DVD and blu-ray

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,210
sources so this is talking about not

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,800
just making not just ripping a DVD for

00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,330
the purposes of having another copy of

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,930
it to give to your mother or whatever

00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,150
this is talking about ripping it for the

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,300
purposes of doing some kind of fair use

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,250
work with that content be it making some

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,980
kind of remix video be it some kind of

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,950
parody something like that we'd already

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,570
had this exception for DVDs but it got

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,779
extended another three years and

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,910
blu-rays got added to it so we've had

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,310
some wonderful victories in this

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,690
rulemaking process and I suspect we're

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,320
gonna have some even more wonderful

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,380
victories this time around but let's be

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,730
honest that's not how this is supposed

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,370
to work innovation thrives when you have

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,160
broad leeway for exploring and

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,620
experimenting think think about the

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,529
protections for innovation that exists

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:52,070
in copyright law itself where we have

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:55,160
this very flexible fair use doctrine

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:58,160
that is flexible so that it can adapt

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,190
and change with new ideas and new

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,810
changes in technology that's how it's

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,880
supposed to work you're supposed to have

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,270
these very broad very flexible

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,180
exceptions that you can then

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,760
or with and used to find new ideas and

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,650
create new business models sometimes I

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,780
like saying about fair use that it

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,510
doesn't place a fence around innovation

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,430
fair use is more like a lantern that you

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,250
can kind of carry with you and find new

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,530
possibilities but unfortunately when it

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,300
comes to DRM that's not what we have

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,030
what we have looks something more like

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,340
this we have these really specific paths

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,400
that are granted to us by the government

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,070
every three years and we are told only

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,190
to stay on those paths and not stray

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:45,070
from them and it is very very easy to

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,550
see the chilling effect that that has on

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:53,530
new innovation and new ideas and keep in

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:56,530
mind the prohibition I in 1201 is not

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:59,380
only against circumventing DRM it's also

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,440
against sharing information it's also

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,690
against sharing with other people

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:14,709
information about how to circumvent a

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:17,350
certain kind of DRM in a sense it's easy

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,959
to forgive Congress for creating this

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:24,070
mess because remember Congress passed

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,930
the DMCA in 1998 and in 1998 when people

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,060
thought about DRM they were mostly

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,730
thinking about music and movies and

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,680
things like that they were certainly not

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,930
thinking about that we would very soon

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,730
be at a time when there is software on

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,950
everything when there is software on

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,660
rice cookers when there is software on

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,030
toilets when there is software on

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,630
refrigerators and yes this is real when

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,980
there is software on egg cartons so they

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,930
did not think about that they were

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,720
creating this situation in which

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,900
manufacturers could exert a great deal

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,200
of control over what their customers do

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,680
with their products on the other hand

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,710
though it's kind of Congress's fault

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,380
that we got here because they were

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,470
creating this fantastic incentive for

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,270
putting those locks on these devices

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,980
where a manufacturer cannot just have

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,320
the License Agreement and have your

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,570
warranty voided or something like that

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,690
but actually have you

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,210
criminal litigation for simply doing

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:30,160
something beyond what they intended with

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:31,930
that product and that's why we sue the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,450
Copyright Office as well as the

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,060
Department of Justice this is a case

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,210
that is currently pending in a in a

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,220
District Court in Washington DC I would

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,960
encourage you guys if you haven't to

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,780
actually read the brief that we filed

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,640
because it's very interesting and a lot

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,140
of times legal briefs are sort of

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,360
difficult to get through if you don't

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,670
spend a lot of time reading them this

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,170
one is very readable and compelling I'm

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,070
not gonna read this whole paragraph to

00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,150
you but I'm gonna read a couple of

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,820
sentences from it

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,310
these provisions broadly restrict the

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,190
public's ability to access speak about

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,620
and use copyrighted materials without

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,420
the traditional safeguards such as the

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,460
fair use doctrine that are necessary to

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,640
protect free speech and allow copyright

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,960
law to coexist with the First Amendment

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,110
skipping down a little bit that try an

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,910
allele rulemaking process why by which

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,270
the public may seek exemptions

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,960
pursuant to section 1201 does not

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,150
alleviate these problems instead it

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,970
itself is an unconstitutional speech

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,220
licensing regime when you have a

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,230
government office saying what kinds of

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,210
speech are lawful or not that is

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,070
literally the very thing that the

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,900
government is not supposed to do I'm

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:52,090
guessing a number of you have already

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,720
seen this or heard about this some about

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,410
a month ago

00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:00,790
EF F made the decision to drop out of

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:03,790
the w3c this came after a very long

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,850
process whereby the w3c was deciding

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,470
whether to incorporate DRM in the form

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,420
of a spec known as encrypted media

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:15,460
extensions into the official html5

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,680
specifications we believed for a long

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,650
time as this debate was going on that to

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,340
do so was really compromising what the

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:27,220
very purpose of the w3c was having this

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,190
set of open standards that every

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,220
manufacturer every

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,350
Houser can adhere to and suddenly using

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,480
that set of open standards to do

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,360
something that is inherently hostile to

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,030
users seemed like seemed to us to be

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,540
very much the wrong direction for the

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:48,960
w3c to go in but I want to be clear

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:52,950
about something here that's not why we

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,800
left the w3c we didn't leave the w3c

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,610
because they incorporated DRM into the

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,950
HTML specifications we did it because

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,760
when it became obvious that this was

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:11,490
going to happen we went to the w3c and

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:15,120
said okay let's as a body make an

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:19,080
agreement that we won't abused the law

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,990
that we won't wield it against security

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,420
researchers that we won't use DMCA and

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,130
the similar laws that exist in other

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,930
countries against people who are not

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,210
circumventing DRM for any unlawful

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,700
purpose but are doing it specifically

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,000
for the purposes of protecting users

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:42,030
security and when the leadership of the

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,210
w3c could not at very least agree to

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,150
doing that that is when we realized that

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:53,690
our time as a member of the w3c had to

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:57,360
come to an end I've been really negative

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,950
during most of this discussion but the

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,760
fact is I'm not actually very

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,660
pessimistic about this issue I believe

00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,730
that this fight is winnable and I'll

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,340
give you a very very specific example of

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,050
why I think this fight is winnable at

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,510
the very beginning of this talk I put up

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,050
that iTunes logo and I mentioned the

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,450
Fairplay DRM raise your hand if you've

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,620
ever bought a piece of music protected

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,750
by Fairplay DRM a few of us really old

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,640
people and I bet you there are probably

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,880
some people in the room who don't even

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,910
know what we're talking about because

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,580
the market moved fair play was really

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,020
really annoying it was annoying to have

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,500
to go through this process of

00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,830
registering and dirige

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,930
during devices it was annoying that

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,730
there was kind of this support for

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,500
third-party devices but it didn't

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,210
exactly work all the way and like

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,620
sometimes you could listen to a song but

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,840
you couldn't fast-forward it or

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,220
something and frankly it was annoying

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,040
that you couldn't try it with new

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,510
devices just as smartphones were

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
becoming a thing and there were all of

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,680
these mp3 players and things that it

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,130
would have been so cool to listen to

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,880
your iTunes music on and so the market

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,730
changed

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,300
and similarly I believe that when it

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:19,120
comes to software DRM the market can and

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,970
will change too and that is where the

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,950
very people in this room come in because

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:27,700
you are the people who look at this

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:30,520
object and don't see a rice cooker you

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,380
see a computer and you understand what

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,350
that means and you understand what

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,330
people can do with that computer and you

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,120
are the people who look at it Volkswagen

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,790
Jetta and don't see a car you see a

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,890
computer and you can think about what

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,720
it's possible to do with that computer

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,540
and you can also think about the

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,060
security implications that are created

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,310
by that computer and the dangers of that

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,930
computer and the potential bugs that we

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,180
need to be able to research and

00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:02,290
understand the people in this room

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,840
understand that stuff and as you teach

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,810
the public about those possibilities and

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,330
as you teach consumers users whatever

00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,390
you want to call them not just what

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:17,820
exists now but what is possible the

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,820
market demands here will change too

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,890
there is a proposal that has been

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,560
introduced in about 12 state

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,410
legislatures including North Carolina

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,220
that blue screen is so hard to look at

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:35,170
sorry that I'm hurting all of your eyes

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,910
but what what this is this is a this is

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:42,250
a state law that would require that

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,200
manufacturers make the information about

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,960
how to disassemble disassemble and

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,830
maintain their products available both

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,610
to the public and and to independent

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:58,360
repair people and if those devices have

00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:00,549
on them any kind of digital locks that

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,830
that that would confound somebody's

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,289
ability to do maintenance and repair

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,120
that it requires them to provide that

00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:10,840
information as well and to provide a

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,299
means of circumventing it this is a

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,830
really really great idea and it's a way

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,549
of making a great deal of progress

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,950
without amending of the DMCA it's been

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,510
introduced in twelve states there's a

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,390
group of folks called the repair

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,830
coalition that is behind this thing and

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,720
if this is something you're interested

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,340
in getting involved with again the bill

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,380
has been introduced in North Carolina

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,580
but I don't actually think that a lot

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,169
has happened with it since it was

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,260
introduced somebody can correct me if

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm wrong about that but absolutely get

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,200
in touch with these folks if you don't

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,789
know how to get in touch with them then

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,470
get in touch with me sorry about that

00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,899
and I will get you in touch with these

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:51,940
folks because this is a really exciting

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:53,470
thing happening and the final thing I'd

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,289
say is to go back to that rule making

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,570
process itself as I mentioned earlier

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,149
it's a complicated process putting

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,480
together these these appeals for

00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:06,639
exceptions to 1201 and one of the things

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,149
that our acquires is assembling stories

00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:13,779
of researchers of hackers of businesses

00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:16,450
whose work is confounded by these

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:20,409
digital locks of business models that

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:23,350
would be possible without 1201 that are

00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,110
imparted our excuse me of business

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,360
models that would be possible without

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:31,389
1201 that are impossible or put in kind

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,760
of a gray area by the existence of 1201

00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:36,190
these are the stories that are so so

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,929
useful for making our case and

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,019
incidentally they're also going to be

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,940
useful for making our case in the courts

00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,649
and so if this describes any of you if

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,980
this describes your work if this

00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:49,870
describes your business models that you

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,299
have been dreaming up or if it describes

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,029
your research in security and safety

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:57,490
whatever it is then get in touch with us

00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,080
because your stories could be the one

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,510
that tilt the scales on this stuff so

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,279
please please do get in touch if this

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,750
describes you there are the images that

00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,490
I used they are all create

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,620
commons-licensed and there are the URLs

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,120
if you didn't have time to jot those

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,220
down then you can find this whole

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,990
presentation at EF f slash ato 2017 it

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,970
is on Google Docs if you're not

00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,440
comfortable using Google Docs then just

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,950
shoot me an email and I will send it to

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,110
you as a PDF so I would love to open

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,370
this up to any questions I can't

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,230
guarantee that I will know the answers

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,230
but I guarantee I will listen to you I

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,010
agree and I actually yeah I was just I

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,450
was a kid when the law was passed and I

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,390
don't know a lot about what went into

00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:00,340
those exact parameters but a big part of

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:04,870
making of the case is showing that it

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:07,390
like does not compromise or does not at

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,940
least severely compromise existing kind

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,080
of entrenched business models and so I

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:17,770
think that there is kind of this idea of

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,870
of wanting to recheck the landscape

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,600
every three years to see if like

00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,220
conditions in the market have changed or

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,320
maybe even to see if those exceptions

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,450
are having an impact on the market that

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,520
they had not imagined but the funny

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:34,600
thing though is that it's usually the

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,330
exact opposite that's the case Apple is

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:41,410
still selling a lot of phones right I

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:43,360
have a suspicion we will see you can ask

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,100
me in a year if I was right about this I

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,960
have a suspicion that you're not

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,750
actually going to see a lot of

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,430
opposition on renewing the phone

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,680
jailbreaking this time around from the

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:56,530
phone manufacturers I think that there

00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,860
were some concerns early on but those

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,810
concerns just simply have not played out

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,930
in any real way that affects their

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,930
business models yeah

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,000
it's very frightening and there are

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:32,300
similar proposals that have been made by

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,059
rights holders here they they refer to

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,260
it as notice and stay down and I think

00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,550
that there's a different term that

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,820
they're using for it in the EU and I

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:43,640
can't remember what it is now what these

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:47,470
proposals all kind of have in common is

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:51,350
that they vastly overestimate what

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:53,350
automated filters are capable of because

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:58,100
the people behind these proposals

00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:01,070
imagine that it's very very easy to

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,110
program an automated filter in a way

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:07,070
that will never kill anything that is a

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,710
legitimate fair use and that's not

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,330
possible and I was arguing about this

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,220
with somebody at our booth earlier today

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:18,080
I would argue that it'll never really be

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:20,300
possible that development in automated

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,070
filters and in content recognition and

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,679
all of that we'll never really

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:30,710
understand the human context and will

00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:33,679
never understand the nuance that that

00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,600
goes into a very you know flexible fair

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,850
use analysis

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,830
there's incidentally this is kind of

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,520
outside of the scope of this talk but

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:46,130
there's also in Congress right now very

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,200
very frightening bill that would do the

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,570
same thing except not for copyright

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,510
infringement but for for content related

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:55,910
to human trafficking and I think that

00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,160
this is a dangerous proposal for a lot

00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,720
of different reasons again it's a little

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,940
bit beyond the scope of this talk but

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,070
come talk to me in the booth later on

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,059
and I'll tell you a bit about it and

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,590
something I've been following very

00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:08,590
closely yeah

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:24,100
there have been attempts there have been

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,860
attempts that end up getting just a

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:30,550
small number of co-sponsors there is a

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,590
bill in Congress this year that that has

00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:36,640
to do with jailbreaking it's called the

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:38,830
your own devices act or yota I'm I'm

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,470
actually not extremely familiar with

00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:45,120
with Yoda but the point is there are

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:49,120
definitely attempts in Congress they are

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,670
they are both not the like sexy issues

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,890
in Congress and also not the issues that

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:56,020
have very wealthy lobbyists behind them

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,970
and so it's it's going it's going to be

00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:03,580
slow progress unfortunately of course

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:05,350
I'm cautiously optimistic about what

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,200
will happen with our with our case over

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:13,770
1201 so there there there are always

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,770
other means of changing the law yeah

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,040
um that's that's a fair point

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:40,870
I would I would take that point I would

00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:44,590
also say that the argument that

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:48,070
proponents of eme have been making that

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,810
it is just less burdensome for consumers

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,490
to be able to do all of this stuff in

00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,560
the browser as opposed to have like

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,880
having like a separate proprietary app

00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:00,220
for for each video streaming service

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,430
like that is a compelling argument in a

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,220
way if you accept those as the only two

00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:10,800
choices and that's when I think of the

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,800
sort of longer arm of justice I do

00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,950
optimistically see a a rejection of DRM

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,950
in that kind of content altogether

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:23,020
because again like you know remember

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,390
that thing where some hacker tried to

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:28,090
blackmail Netflix by by putting all of

00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:30,250
Orange is the new black on line like it

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,200
didn't work because that stuff doesn't

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,180
work because they already know that all

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:40,260
of that stuff is online and yet people

00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,260
still subscribe to Hulu and Netflix yeah

00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:02,450
that's a really really good question a a

00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:04,340
former colleague of mine Parker Higgens

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,500
there's kind of an internet celebrity

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm guessing someone you know who he is

00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,070
he wrote this really excellent essay

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,520
called yes all DRM essentially answering

00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:20,720
that very question saying that that

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:24,500
basic principle that robots should do

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,810
what humans tell him to is just as

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,179
applicable in the current world of

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:38,770
streaming services as it was in the

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:38,770
world of downloadable content yeah

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,710
well that was my point but there's other

00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:53,359
ways outside of the of Congress well

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,090
like in this case one of the ways is

00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,940
litigation what I would kind of call the

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,940
other big way is through market norms

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,730
mm-hmm yeah and like that's a fair point

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,800
and of course there's also this whole

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:40,150
licensing versus owning discussion going

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,160
on in software right as the the the way

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,230
I see it the public kind of accepted the

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,910
idea of software being licensed to you

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,270
and then we realized the big mess that

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,650
that accepting that puts us into you

00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,420
know the thing that I would keep going

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:57,490
back to with all of this is that

00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:01,420
smartest cow problem that all of the

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:04,480
Netflix content you can find in in in

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:13,870
downloadable formats and yet people

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:17,950
still use Netflix any other questions if

00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:20,230
not then I want to with the five minutes

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,240
that we have left I want to mention a

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:29,640
couple of other things to you guys very

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:32,740
quickly the FF has always been primarily

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,830
focused on national and international

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,710
issues we we do a lot of work with

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,090
what's going on in Congress we do a fair

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,520
amount of work with what's going on in

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,830
trade agreements as you mentioned but

00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:50,110
when it comes to what's actually going

00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:52,870
on in Raleigh we do not have we don't

00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:55,660
have the staff power and it is

00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,490
increasingly at the at the city and

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,310
state level where these issues are

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,110
really really important with the rise of

00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:05,080
things like police surveillance

00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:07,240
technologies and so we realized that we

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,300
needed to deal with this problem in some

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,000
way with some kind of mechanism for

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,830
local action and we thought about a lot

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,900
of different models and we realized that

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:19,600
what you might think of as sort of the

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,070
traditional model when a big

00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,570
organization decides to get in the

00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,210
grassroots where they like set up a

00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,550
chapter in every state didn't feel right

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,650
for EF F in lots and lots of different

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,760
ways and so what we did instead is we

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,400
launched this thing called the

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,010
Electronic Frontier Alliance which is a

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,900
network of groups around the country I

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,420
think that there are about 60 of them

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,730
now and

00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,500
you there are student groups like hacker

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,869
groups in there there are kind of

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,890
traditional old-school civil liberties

00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:52,500
groups there are there are maker spaces

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,720
in there there are two groups in this

00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,660
area in there there is both besides

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,380
Raleigh and DC 9 1 9 our members of the

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:04,230
Electronic Frontier Alliance all that is

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,990
necessary to be a member organization of

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,579
vfa is one to be a real group to not

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,349
just be a website but to be a group

00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,829
that's actually doing things in the real

00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:15,990
world and two to agree or to endorse I

00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:19,170
should say these five principles free

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:21,780
expression security privacy creativity

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,160
and access to knowledge over the past

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,809
year and a half or so I've gotten to

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,280
know a number of these groups and

00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:28,380
they're really really cool things that

00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,109
they're doing and some of them are doing

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,069
such cool things they're doing local

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:37,319
advocacy around police use of

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:38,549
surveillance technologies some of them

00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:41,730
are doing work on the level of

00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:43,920
University policy university policies

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,599
around patenting is another kind of pet

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,930
issue of mine that I will talk with you

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,210
about later if you're curious they there

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,250
are groups doing like security trainings

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,930
for local activists and local

00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,730
communities there are groups doing

00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,650
really cool things and we get to kind of

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,660
be this hub that just listens to all of

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,069
them talking to each other and connects

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,559
folks with other groups doing similar

00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:06,660
things if this is of interest to you to

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,430
get involved with these digital rights

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,160
II kind of issues on the local level

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,200
then I would strongly encourage you to

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,510
either get involved with one of the

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,549
local groups here or if they're not

00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,500
quite the right fit for what you want to

00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:20,910
do then talk to us and try to get

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,520
something else started locally because

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:27,210
it's a really cool opportunity and the

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,280
very last thing I will say is anybody

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,680
who is interested in continuing this

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,109
discussion we're going to have a little

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,309
informal get-together tonight at 8 p.m.

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:40,109
at a very super-secret location

00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:41,700
if you are interested in coming and

00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:43,559
chatting with us in having a beer with

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,780
us then I would I would love to continue
