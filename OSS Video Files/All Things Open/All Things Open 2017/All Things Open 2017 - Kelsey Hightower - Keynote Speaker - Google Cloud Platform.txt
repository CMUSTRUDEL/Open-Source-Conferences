I hate when they say is going to be good

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,790
and that your expectations are way too

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:14,549
high I just come in cold

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:16,109
good morning it's so nice to see

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,369
technology in the south I grew up in

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:24,000
Atlanta and never in a mr. Sal

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:28,019
represents in technology so it's nice to

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,490
be here so we're going to talk about we

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,859
talked about open source align we talked

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,540
about the source code and one thing that

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,100
I found through my career that's even

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,190
more important more powerful than the

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,870
source code is actually the knowledge I

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,350
look at source code these days is just

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,539
the serialization of ideas right someone

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,579
figures out how to do something and then

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,219
we teach the computer how to replicate

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,949
it so to me the source code has become

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,800
less disgusting over time because

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,430
there's so many programming languages

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,239
but the ideas are what's important

00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,670
unfortunately not everyone can read

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,159
source code we have this illusion that

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,590
everyone can learn the code or everyone

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,909
cares the code I actually find it pretty

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,799
boring these days if I don't have a

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:16,439
great idea I mean people like fixing

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,729
bugs boring as hell you should be a

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,450
programmer where you grow up was like

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,770
that's what you do no thanks so we have

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,170
to have something a little bit more

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,470
inspiring so hopefully my laptop shows

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,020
up so we're gonna walk through this this

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,900
new world of what development should be

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,150
like one that's not as as boring I hope

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,049
how do we see terminal I don't have any

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,049
slides of that okay

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,990
if you get nervous with this terminal

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,740
don't worry we're gonna type stuff today

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,690
so I went to the after party

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,790
and I know there's a lot of people there

00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,010
are new grads that are here just

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,540
learning about this stuff if you're new

00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:03,750
grad raise your hand how do you lying

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,280
then or maybe all the new who has rap at

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:11,670
the party rookie mistake never go to

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,230
that party but I was one of those people

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,140
that didn't learn the code until around

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,940
24 25 years old okay

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,370
well people believe that you have to

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,980
learn early to be good at this stuff

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,320
I actually think the ideas are more

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,440
important the tools are what matter

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,670
because the tools change all the time be

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,690
honest with yourselves really quickly

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,870
how many people feel that their skills

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,550
are starting to get a little outdated

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,310
yeah you hear all this stuff about

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,180
containers distributed systems and

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,019
unfortunately a lot of us will dismiss

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,870
this as hype until it's too late then

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:52,290
you look up that's the new norm and then

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,239
you feel a little uneasy the truth is

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,910
most of the things that we learn are

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,730
just slight improvements over each other

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,019
right so one thing I'm going to do to

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,720
show everyone at ease around this

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,120
container stuff and it's the ideas that

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,010
matter here so we're entering this new

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,970
world of computations kind of be a

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,310
little bit different than the one we

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,310
know what's the world we know the world

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,570
we know is you write some code anyone

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,500
tell me what programming language this

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,310
is just shout it out really quickly I

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,519
think you know me and you're guessing

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,940
also you saw the dot go extension okay

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,830
kind of gave it away this is the go

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,810
programming language there are so many

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,950
other programming languages how many

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,950
people have ever been assistant min

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,459
before okay we're gonna talk about that

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,049
in a minute so developers write code and

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,880
we believe the world is this easily

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,940
something like this go build your app

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,170
look at that for those that are new I

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,500
compiled the app this is come

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,660
our language and I built a binary these

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,950
are things we take for granted now with

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,280
this binary I'm just gonna run it on my

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,700
laptop watch out this is so simple there

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,830
you go

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,310
have this binary now watch you can you

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,030
can hit it there we go curl it's gonna

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,630
be amazing you remember right in your

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,630
first program

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:25,340
no matter what people say you're a

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,290
developer at this point okay all right

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,420
so we have this hello world thing it

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,550
also has a developer you believe the

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,230
world is also this simple we need to run

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,100
this on a server

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:40,550
okay now DevOps is about to be born

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,380
right now so to get this on a server

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,860
I can't just take this binary that I

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,540
have and run it on the other server so

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,150
what I have to do is compile it so this

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,760
is called cross compiling have you ever

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,700
done this before your programming

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,610
language may not be as friendly so we're

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,070
just gonna do hello world and then we're

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,480
just going to build that thing again

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,190
and then this is what you do now this is

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,010
how we used to do it before all this

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,350
distributed computing and cloud stuff

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:15,260
you take this binary and then we're just

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:17,870
going to copy it to a server right gonna

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,420
copy it to the server over my tethering

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:25,250
plan AT&T is like what the hell are you

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:28,010
doing whoa we hope it works all right

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,020
and then you log on to the server and

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,300
you start it this is what we're doing

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,410
about 15 20 years ago now some of you

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,790
are sitting there's like 10 this is what

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:41,360
we're doing right now I am I company but

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,940
it's alright just pretend okay for 10

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,240
that's not the case and you take this

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:50,510
binary on the server and then you run it

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,040
ok it's really simple okay let's just do

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,270
hello world now I know if some of you

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,060
think it's like what the hell are you

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,850
doing do you know the IT industry has

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:07,900
spent probably a trillion dollars doing

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:09,470
this trillion dollars doing this and

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,010
have you heard of this thing called

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,010
on-call

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:21,840
for those of you that don't know around

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,789
2:45 a.m. your phone will ring it's

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,669
going to rain because this server will

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,139
go down and you're going to wake up and

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:42,840
you're going to you put on your heroics

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:47,220
and you're going to do this so now at

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,949
this point you're badass okay and then

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,569
your company goes to a conference and

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,479
they come back they say we're going to

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:58,500
the cloud and then all the machines show

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:02,220
up so you're just like oh yeah I want to

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,430
script it I'm going to automate how many

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,620
people think automation is good yeah all

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,810
the hands go what a mission is perfect I

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,750
could just automate this whole process

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,960
build a binary and copy to all the

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:22,190
machines automation and configuration

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:24,539
management was born there's a problem

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,990
this isn't solved an on-call problem

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:30,569
they probably increases the on-call

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,529
problem and people have a hard time

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,370
understanding the difference between

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:37,259
automation and orchestration right now

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,029
we take these binaries and we are very

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,930
deliberate about where they go so let's

00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,169
look at the difference between

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,509
automation and orchestration and the way

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:49,849
I like to explain is with tetris anyone

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:51,990
ever play Nintendo hell yeah

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:54,560
my mom didn't know the importance of

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,029
Nintendo's like it was very important so

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,940
this game of Tetris I'm going to explain

00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:04,169
the difference between automation and

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,969
orchestration so automation is good for

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,009
all the new people one-click deployments

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:10,500
is the holy grail for our industry you

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,120
click the button once fully deployed

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,029
okay I'm gonna show you what that looks

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,330
like you got to do it fast too

00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:20,430
one-click deployment click fully

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:27,120
automate it look at that

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:29,750
yay Sado pirate I had aplenty any server

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,710
like this is now what you thought about

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:37,229
you're going to lose because the way we

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,700
write these scripts you have to know

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,650
every single thing that will possibly

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,750
happen upfront before you write the

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,540
scripts so we've done all of this

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,500
automation but it's still painful ten

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,850
years in it doesn't work I'll call and

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,250
then we even got startups like pager

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:59,910
duty how do you build a whole startup

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:01,680
around uncle so remember the thing is we

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,050
have to learn this is not just about

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
writing code and open-source there are

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,459
ideas of how to solve this problem so

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,220
the other part of this whole open nature

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,040
is about sharing ideas one of those

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,560
ideas where I work at a place called

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,940
Google we also have very similar

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
problems in the early days of Google

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,020
everyone thinks like Google has figured

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,640
out all this stuff no we have not the

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,830
only thing Google has is all the

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,980
problems not necessarily all the

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,540
solutions so we get to experiment a lot

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,060
more than most people would because we

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,230
get this exposure to things so one nice

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,300
thing that I like to see in the open

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,339
source movement or this open movement is

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,830
this idea of sharing ideas here's how we

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,490
manage lots of these little tiny

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,020
machines in a way that we can reduce

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,450
being woken up for basic failures like a

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,580
server going down okay so when you read

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,010
all of this stuff then projects like

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,529
kubernetes just become implementations

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,180
of this idea so when people ask me how

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:00,450
do I go about learning this new stuff

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,240
honestly the idea is more important so

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,520
for me I understand the ideas any new

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,440
open source project that comes out I get

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,339
it it looks a little bit like that they

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,540
may have a different implementation

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,650
detail

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,750
so let's talk about the implementation

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,140
details how many people have heard of

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:22,110
containers keep your hand up if you

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,700
think it's just hype it's legit the

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,230
analogy I like to use to explain why we

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,390
have containers is if you go to FedEx

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,860
almost Christmas time and you drag a

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,860
wagon of stuff into FedEx

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,590
bikes and toys and I pass was the first

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,000
thing they're going to ask you to do

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,730
really loud put it in a box no one cares

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,650
about the loose items we need them to be

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,750
packaged in a way that the rest of the

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,160
system can fully automate itself so

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,250
let's look at what happens when we put

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,540
this in a box alright so here we go so

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,920
we're going to think about this

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,840
differently we're going to give our

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,520
application shape and once we give them

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,830
shape we can reason about them

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,010
so in order once we can reason about our

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,770
application we can start to do something

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,210
slightly different we can start

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,670
strategically placing them in our

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,710
clusters okay so what I'm doing here is

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,570
a technique called bin packing you'll

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,760
see tools like kubernetes do this oh man

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,410
this may not be a very good game I know

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,730
you guys aren't like wow he can talk and

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,540
play Tetris at the same time it's like

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,850
totally so this idea bin packing is we

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,710
want to take our workloads and examine

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,500
every piece as it comes into the playing

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,650
field now if we do this wow man I'm like

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,630
where do I place these next pieces so

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,280
kubernetes is doing the same thing so

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,710
we're placing these workloads all over

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,330
our cluster no I don't fail come on

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,040
you can imagine leaving space of one of

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,020
the special machines this is the machine

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,970
that has the GPU of the very expensive

00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,280
machine to run we can allow that

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,070
particular workload to land on that

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,620
machine and guess what the magic is once

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,350
that workload is complete we can reclaim

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:10,600
all the memory and CPU and return to the

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:12,520
system hell yeah you can clap all right

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,640
so now that we have this smart system in

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,110
play we're no longer going to copy

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,300
binaries to a single machine we're gonna

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,160
take a collection of machines make them

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,950
look like a single machine we're gonna

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,650
use a bit of software in between to give

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,580
and describe our workload and it will do

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,780
the placement for us okay so what we

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,890
want to do now is start to give these

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,390
things shape the first thing we need to

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,950
do is build a container image I'm not

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,690
going to do this now but here's what it

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,400
looks like in my world so that

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,020
compilation step this is a new feature

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,430
inside of something like docker you guys

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,050
to use other tools to build this stuff

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,300
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,000
the similar command that I

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,890
earlier build the binary if you notice I

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,510
have this second step underneath where I

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,240
take the built binary and I put that

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,860
into a package and this is the trick to

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,050
make your package is really really small

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,120
right so now that we have shaped these

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,860
are going to define the shapes that

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,660
we're going to give to our scheduler

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,700
which is going to be kubernetes again

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,760
all open source and I'm have to do one

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,310
more thing we have to describe to

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,870
kubernetes what our shape looks like so

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,579
this is what we call a deployment config

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,920
we can tell it things about how it

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,779
should update things we can also give it

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,670
a name of whether we will like it to

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,220
deploy so this is like dropping a piece

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,779
into the Tetris playing field once it

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,610
sees the piece it knows how to place it

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,380
on one of the ten servers that are

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,760
running into my infrastructure so we're

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,519
going to do now is tell kubernetes to

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,950
run this thing for me and then we're

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,209
going to tell it to just do this apply

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:41,250
all right so we're going to have here

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:44,279
now is our application running in our

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,380
cluster will do this command so we have

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,019
one of them running now the nice thing

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,399
here is once it's running we can

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,279
communicate with this I'm going to speed

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,990
up a little bit because of time so once

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,829
we have this running we can actually

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:08,839
start to communicate with it once I get

00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:08,839
things working all right

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,989
the demo gods are like you tempted me

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:23,720
too much

00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:23,720
I want to recover I think just try this

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,540
hold on it's just warming up I was

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,830
sitting there for a while all right

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,570
let's just just check on something

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,910
really quick so also when you're doing

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,260
live demos it may not work what you do

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,800
is pretend like it was supposed to

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,930
happen

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,990
and you keep going you just talked

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,180
through it alright let's see what we can

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,390
figure out what's going on here all

00:14:49,180 --> 00:15:07,260
right so none of these things are

00:14:52,390 --> 00:15:10,089
healthy all right so our app is deployed

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,890
so the nice thing now is we can actually

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,110
start running more commands to scale

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,790
this up but now we're in this world of

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,760
abstractions you knows you're not

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,019
copying things to servers anymore we

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,240
didn't even pick the server where this

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:25,450
will run we now have a way of describing

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,459
what we want we're one step closer to

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,470
this world where maybe we don't type

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,779
commands anymore would it be cool if you

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,579
can like talk to it and just say deploy

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,070
my application so many people wish we

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,020
could just do that right like this is so

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,640
old the way we do things so I have this

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,770
little prototype that I've built we're

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,140
going to try to see if you could do such

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,149
a thing because I think the technology

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,500
is there we just have to think a little

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,360
differently about how we approach these

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,660
problems so I'm gonna try so hopefully

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:58,110
my phone is on you hear it let's try it

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,110
okay google talk to container engine Oh

00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:04,149
av people this is gonna be on you this

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,690
is all you're gonna try it again

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:10,950
I will I like bling I like to blame

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,950
people during my post mortems

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,819
okay google talk to container engine

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:32,490
I'll give you one more try you guys

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:47,550
ready not you guys okay Google talk to

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:49,980
container engine hello it's nice to be

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,319
here at all things open this is a pretty

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,629
large crowd you have here I noticed

00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:01,949
you're using conference Wi-Fi the demo

00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:03,380
gods won't be too happy scale the hello

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:13,409
world deployment

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:17,240
how many replicas for scaling the hello

00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:17,240
world deployment to four replicas

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:30,170
so if as we close out it's easy to like

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,700
bring things up and down now the holy

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,760
ground this may not work perfectly we

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,320
got some Wi-Fi going on but imagine if

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,880
you can just tell it to update the

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,030
application in place

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,070
okay so I have version 1 of this and

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,390
version 2 stored as a container so what

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,250
I would like to do now just ask the

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,380
system to just upgrade it for me right

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,730
there's no need to update new commands

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:56,270
so let's try it now update the hello

00:17:52,730 --> 00:18:04,580
world deployment updating the hello

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:07,270
world deployment to version 2.0 I got to

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,270
see it work first

00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:37,690
awesome I gotta admit that was pretty

00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:39,440
dope

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,010
and with that like to end the

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:48,519
presentation thank you

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:48,519
