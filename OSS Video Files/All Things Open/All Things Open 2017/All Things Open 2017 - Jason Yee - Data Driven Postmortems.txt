one of my favorite quotes from Henry

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,450
Ford the only real mistake is the one

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,440
from which we will learn nothing so our

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,360
plan today is to learn about

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,090
post-mortems learn how we can learn from

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,280
our failure particularly using the data

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,410
so Who am I

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,570
well I'm Jason I work at a company

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,609
called data dog you might have noticed

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,439
the rather large crowd that we had just

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,720
a few minutes ago downstairs we were

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,320
giving away a Nintendo switch

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,380
unfortunately if you missed that you

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,300
didn't get the gaming console but data

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,510
dog is a great platform I like working

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,579
there I work as a technical writer and

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,260
evangelist which means that I get to

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,210
read through all of our code figure out

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,280
what it does and make it accessible to

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,110
people like you developers that use

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,480
their product I also get to fly around

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,390
the world and talk about interesting

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,309
things around the DevOps space how we

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,890
learn from failures how we build

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,110
resilient systems I'm also a whisky

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,610
hunter so if you like whisky and you

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,280
know of any good places around town let

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,500
me know later data dog is a SAS based

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,750
monitoring platform we handle trillions

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,580
of points of data every day that comes

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,920
to roughly somewhere around 40 million

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,320
points of data every second and we are

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,630
hiring so if you're interested in doing

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
creative challenging work around

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,009
monitoring building monitoring systems

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,020
building resilient systems and learning

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:24,119
from failure then check out our site

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,430
jobs data dog HQ comm so if you actually

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,020
did decide to apply for a job at data

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,790
dog one of the things that you would get

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,320
is our internal developer guide and

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,790
you'd see this statement at the very

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,100
beginning of it and it says that the

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,130
problems that we work on are hard and

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,189
they often don't have obvious clean-cut

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,380
solutions so we have to cultivate our

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,479
troubleshooting skills no matter what

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,640
area we work in and this applies not

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,170
only to data dog but it applies to I

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,229
believe everything that we're all

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,810
working on today everybody in this room

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,490
is working on complex systems whether or

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,040
not you think you are from the smallest

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,049
websites web developers all the way to

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,810
people building huge distributed apps

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,430
we're working in a world that we just

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,799
have complex systems and they're not

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,670
always technical so we do need to

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,360
cultivate our troubleshooting skills

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,550
this has led to the rise of a thing

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,040
blameless post-mortems within the DevOps

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,830
world limbless post-mortems was a coin

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,110
termed by a guy named john all SpA who

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,240
used to work at etsy and the notion here

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,790
wasn't that people weren't necessarily

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,420
at fault or that we should just you know

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,460
walk away and not take responsibility

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,350
the notion here was that when we're

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,290
trying to learn from failure if we

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,660
accuse people if we start to point

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,600
fingers people don't tell us the truth

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,220
and we can't learn from them so let's

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,770
take a step back and why did this come

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,959
up within the realm of DevOps well

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,970
DevOps as defined by these two gentlemen

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,800
Damon Edwards and John Willis John was

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,440
actually here this morning on this stage

00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,510
speaking but they defined DevOps as cams

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,860
culture automation metrics and sharing

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,020
oftentimes when we talk about DevOps we

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,739
hear people say the DevOps tool chain or

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,660
my DevOps tool or my DevOps automation

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,360
but it's something that we have to

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,400
understand that DevOps isn't a tool it

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,900
doesn't come in some automation but a

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,480
colleague of mine likes to point out

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,150
these gentlemen the Amish they can do a

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,940
lot with no modern tooling the Amish

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,470
refuse to use electricity and so they

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,140
build everything with hand tools and

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,260
they can do it get a lot done they can

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,489
build giant barns in a single day just

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,000
by working together and that really

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:39,700
emphasizes the notion behind DevOps if

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,650
DevOps is there to make us work and move

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,410
faster as organizations to build better

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,290
things it's not about the tools it's

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,440
about us as people and once we have that

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,239
culture figured out once we have that

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,850
culture and the sharing and the

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,709
collaboration then the tools really just

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,380
our tools there are things that help us

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,720
move just a little bit faster so you can

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,280
imagine that putting together a barn and

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,350
having that communication and then

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,959
giving people power tools how much more

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,489
quickly would they be able to move but

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,950
you could also imagine on the flip side

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,440
if I had a guy up in a crane like this

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,910
and communication was broken and he

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,459
wasn't communicating with people on the

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,440
ground well he would be dropping some

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,349
serious payloads on people's heads it

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,539
would be a disaster so if we're thinking

00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,800
about DevOps and learning and having

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,960
that culture in that sharing

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,479
when it comes to post mortems were

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,900
really focusing on the culture and on

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,729
the sharing aspect so if your

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,300
traditional post mortem process looks

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,440
more like this put away your pitchforks

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,860
start thinking about how we can actually

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,300
learn from our post mortems now just a

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,400
few resources and I will share these

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,949
slides later I'll have a link but John

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,740
all spa's blog posts on the original

00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,110
blameless post mortems is there it's on

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,449
the Etsy blog and a gentleman named

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,879
named Dave's we Bock actually wrote a

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,259
fantastic book as well that's a link to

00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,650
that so you can go and download it

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:10,330
afterward so culture and sharing are

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,889
really great but with cams we we know

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,629
that metrics is a part of that and

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,210
that's I think what we're all here to

00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:19,500
learn about is how can we apply data to

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,400
what we're learning about our failures

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,129
unfortunately I think a lot of people

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,870
can resonate with the honest status page

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:31,360
here so a data dog we like to say that

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,590
collecting data is cheap but not having

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,389
it when you need it can be very

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,550
expensive just to give you some numbers

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,440
there's a research group called the

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,719
Aberdeen group they've done a little bit

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,599
of research on - how much money that we

00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,729
lose for downtime for some for small

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,759
companies they estimate the loss at

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,650
roughly 8,000 dollars per hour for

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,419
medium-sized companies that number jumps

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,400
up to two hundred and fifteen thousand

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,539
dollars every hour and for large

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,909
companies if we're thinking about

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,779
enterprise scale companies that number

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:03,940
is close to a million dollars every hour

00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,069
so when you think of how much it costs

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,810
to store data if I set up an s3 bucket

00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,000
and just start dumping data there

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,129
it cost me roughly thirty bucks a month

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,639
to store Tennant air or 10 to gigabytes

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:18,219
of data compare that cost even if I

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,889
scale it up and replicated over multiple

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,539
availability zones you know if I'm in an

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,909
enterprise and losing a million dollars

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:29,889
an hour those are two vastly different

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:31,779
scales so you do understand that you

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,490
need to collect the metrics in order to

00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:36,039
determine what went wrong and to learn

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,199
from your failures but not all metrics

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,120
are created equal you can't just gather

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,450
all the metrics and assume that you have

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,340
every

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,990
there are really four good qualities of

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,850
metrics that you need when you're

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,860
gathering data about your systems and

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,900
the first is that they have to be well

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,060
understood and there's sort of two

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,030
components to this but I'll give the

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,930
analogy here that is the blind men and

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,390
the elephant

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,340
there's an old parable of a group of

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,470
blind men and they're introduced to an

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,810
elephant and each of them grabs on to a

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,280
portion of the elephant and when one guy

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,470
grabs on to the leg and says that the

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,450
elephant is like a tree because this big

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,920
leg and another one grabs on to the

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,260
trunk and says that the elephant is like

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,440
a snake because it's you know flexible

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,480
and it's thick like that when it comes

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,550
to your metrics your metrics need to be

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,550
well understood if you're grabbing on to

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,040
a portion of your systems you need to

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,870
understand not only what that means what

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,600
those metrics mean about that portion of

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,130
your system but you need to also see

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,140
that within the larger scope of your

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,090
system so when it comes to your

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,610
monitoring tools you need to be pulling

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,100
everything that you can into one single

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,170
place so that everybody on your team and

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,720
across your organization whether they be

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,760
ops or developers or even business

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,490
people can gather the metrics that they

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,110
need and see it as a complete whole the

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,790
second quality that we need for our

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,400
metrics is that they have to have

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,230
sufficient granularity I think we

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,630
inherently understand this when we look

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,280
at things like the Olympics last year

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,530
the Olympics happened and one of my

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,690
favorite events is the men's 50 meter

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,030
freestyle it's one of the fastest events

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,130
in the Summer Games the races as we can

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,830
see here it got a little bit of cutoff

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:22,330
but they're roughly 21 seconds so the

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:25,660
u.s. won gold at about 21 point 4 I big

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,080
for for 21 point 4 seconds flat silver

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,090
ended up getting in at 21.4 won so we

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,490
understand that for this particular race

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,530
we needed hundredths of a second and

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,390
unfortunately it got cut off but even at

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,010
a hundredth of a second we could see

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,560
that in sixth place

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,380
there was actually a tie between Brazil

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,270
and the Republic of South Africa when it

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,330
comes to our metrics we understand that

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,700
it's very similar that we need to divide

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,190
time down in order to see what's going

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,579
on so if we look at our metric

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,269
well here's an example we've got a peak

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:04,269
that's happening at roughly 206 and 14

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:07,810
seconds and this CPU spike happens and

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,930
it's about 46% so not outrageous but

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,759
it's definitely quite a spike if we

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,259
decide that our granularity isn't going

00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,959
to be seconds that our granularity is

00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,509
going to be whole minutes well then not

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,850
only does that average it out it shifts

00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,220
that time forward to just being 206 p.m.

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,889
but it also means that our peak is now

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,620
36% so we're losing information and

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:33,069
we're skewing it if we shift this to

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,540
five minute increments then you can see

00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:36,220
that we no longer have a peak

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,889
everything's been averaged down to just

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,319
12 percent and again our time is shifted

00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:43,689
to the start of a 5-minute increment so

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,980
if you're having an outage and you're

00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,620
looking at your metrics and you're

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,540
looking at your dashboards and you see

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,399
some sort of issue and you're trying to

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,050
remediate this and let's take a look at

00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,899
our logs to see what our application is

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,360
generating are you supposed to look at

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,029
2:05 are you supposed to look look at

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,310
206 how do you know where to actually

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,410
look so your granularity really really

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,180
matters when it comes to figuring out

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,870
what's going wrong in your systems and

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,730
learning from them the third quality of

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,130
metrics that we absolutely need is for

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,170
them to be tagged in filterable as we

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,420
start to build more complex systems and

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,120
geo distribute them and break them up to

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,189
two multiple tiers and multiple

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,709
applications or services it's helpful to

00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:29,050
know where they came from and so to be

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,269
able to search on that so if you think

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,579
about a data point and what our metrics

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,130
used to look like they used to be a name

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,750
or what is it and a value how much is it

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,449
and then obviously a timestamp of when

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,100
it happened but the the more important

00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:44,800
part that we need in our metrics these

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,899
days is to have metadata to have tags of

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,779
where it is what application it's from

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,220
where in the world is that sitting that

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,709
allows us to slice and dice our

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,860
applications and our systems so rather

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,860
than just looking at a dashboard or a

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,139
chart that gives me aggregated metrics I

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,059
can now ask questions against my systems

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,200
I can get that observability that I need

00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:09,600
so I can ask it for example show me the

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
CPU usage or the requests per second of

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,660
my web application that's sitting in

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,670
u.s. East one a that's running on a t

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,230
too small

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,320
start to dial in the information that we

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,000
can actually get from our systems when

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,170
you have query based monitoring as I

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
mentioned that's what gives you

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,329
observability observability isn't just

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,649
this buzzword that's come about

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,810
observability really does mean that it

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,850
means what is visible in your system

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,529
what questions can you ask and if you

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,089
don't have that tagging and that

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:45,690
filtering there aren't very many

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:47,430
questions that you can ask the fourth

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,779
quality that we need in our metrics is

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,730
that they absolutely have to be

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,130
long-lived we have to keep our metrics

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,490
around in order to see patterns and

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,930
trends so if we're looking at for

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,870
example how long if we're you're using

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,519
public cloud well if we're using cloud

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,310
watch they're the leader at fifteen

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,529
months but they do a rollup so as we saw

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,329
that granularity actually plays and

00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:12,029
works hand-in-hand with your retention

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,070
if you roll up to one hour increments

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,430
even though you can see that that data

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,199
15 months later how useful is it at one

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,970
hour as we saw with the roll-up with

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,420
that graph even in five minutes you lose

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,519
a lot so a data dog we like to keep

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,490
things around in the granularity you

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,370
send it to us and so one second for 15

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,050
months but if you're running your own

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,640
systems consider how long you're

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,010
actually keeping things as mentioned

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,959
before storage is cheap you can keep

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,040
things around for a lot longer than you

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,860
think you can so those are the four

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,649
qualities of good metrics but how should

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,199
we actually think about our metrics well

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,760
a data dog we like to place them

00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:56,220
essentially in two buckets and then

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,100
events being sort of a third related

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,380
category I particularly love doughnuts

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,180
so I'm going to use an example of a

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,269
doughnut Factory if I have a doughnut

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,699
Factory my primary metric has to be my

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,870
work metrics my work metrics being the

00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:12,800
things that are important to my business

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,360
which is how many doughnuts can I sell

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,069
how many doughnuts can I sell then

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,319
obviously relates to how many doughnuts

00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,070
can I produce how many of them are good

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,330
donuts with

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,040
our glaze and how many of them are

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,360
poorly glazed and I just have to throw

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,620
away the underlying and metrics that I

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
have around that are what I call

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,850
resource metrics there are things like

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,800
how much flour do I have how much sugar

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,650
do I have do I have enough of the things

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,060
that make donuts that operate my line

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,530
that I can keep working and then events

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,790
events aren't actually metrics but

00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,200
events are the things that help us

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,770
understand what's going on in our

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,600
systems so national donut day is a great

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,270
event you should all participate that

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,190
next year but it means that we're all

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,070
going to be buying Donuts that will

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,720
impact my donut factory if everybody's

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,350
buying more Donuts I need to ramp up

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
production

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,100
similarly with our systems this will be

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,600
things like code changes scaling events

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,490
anything that could actually affect the

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
systems that my applications are running

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,600
on that will inform me of why my

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,330
application might be performing poorly

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,010
or why might actually be performing me

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,350
better but I need to know these things

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,560
in order to learn about my systems and

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:29,550
to learn from any failure scenarios or

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,440
any other scenarios that happen once we

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,120
have these then we can start to recurse

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,220
down and find the problems within our

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,010
system so we take that work metric that

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,660
high level business metric and we see

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,400
the underlying resource metrics that

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,380
support that and then you try to

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,180
correlate any sort of events that happen

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,090
around that but the thing about

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,270
resources is resources do become work

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,310
metrics so for a leader in my

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,470
organization they might be alerted on

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,240
that work metric that donuts are not

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,850
being produced but the underlying

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,130
resource metrics of things like having

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,020
enough flour enough sugar well that's a

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,880
work metric for my Baker

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,500
similarly with our systems our

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,910
high-level business metrics are

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,970
important for the leaders in our

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,590
organizations but the developers who end

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,390
up building the services that were on

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,090
they should get alerts when those

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,550
services go down but those services are

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,130
supported by components so if you have a

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,900
data store behind that if that data

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,780
store goes down that's a work metric for

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,390
your DB team and ultimately that DB runs

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,030
on a server that's a work metric for

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,730
your sre or your ops team

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,490
now notice when I had that chart it does

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,380
branch off a lot of people try to do

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,540
root cause analysis have you ever looked

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:47,160
at roots there's no single or root we

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,780
work in complex systems as I said before

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,240
which means there's going to be a lot of

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,030
collaborating components a lot of

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,180
factors in our failures try not to focus

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,010
in on one particular root cause because

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,890
often it'll mean that you're missing out

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,350
on other information dead-on third

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,140
information oftentimes is the human

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,380
element complex systems are complex

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,940
because humans are complex so let's talk

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,820
about the human side of running a

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,380
post-mortem the first thing that we

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,720
should know about that is that if you're

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,010
still responding to an incident don't

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,620
try to run a post-mortem

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,330
if you're an engineer or developer and

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,920
you're trying to solve a problem don't

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,640
be distracted you can learn from things

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,980
later but your primary goal as you're in

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,680
an incident is to fix that incident and

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,200
get things back and running with that

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,480
said who should be part of the

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,089
post-mortem it's really easy to say

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,860
everybody right something went wrong

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,260
everybody to get together but who is

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,480
everybody so the way that I like to

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,270
frame this to ensure that we actually do

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,400
cat capture everybody who's important is

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:56,339
to think of things as a crime-scene

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,130
investigator you become the detective in

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:03,060
this incident if we think of things as a

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,380
crime scene well I as a detective if I

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,810
showed up to a crime scene I wouldn't

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,360
just talk to the police right the police

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,550
are the first responders you're first

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,069
responders are your engineers your

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,050
developers who are first addressing the

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,760
issue and we don't want to just stop

00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,069
with them so just like a detective

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,610
rather than just talking to the police I

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,230
want to talk to the witnesses so the

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,060
witnesses the people who identified

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,130
whatever went wrong with their system

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,100
that could be customers it could be

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,600
internal users of your application but

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,840
those people are important they have a

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,580
unique unique perspective into the

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,110
issues that happened and they can

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,970
provide you details about how it

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,420
affected them which will help you build

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,920
better applications similarly if I were

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,390
a detective I wouldn't just talk to

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,420
the first responders and the witnesses

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,210
but I want to talk to the victim so the

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,800
victims are you're affected users so

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,380
talk to the people that were directly

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,630
affected again these could be internal

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,310
customers external customers but you

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,990
want to talk to everybody who witnessed

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,910
or was affected by your incident so we

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,250
know who we want to talk to you what do

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,380
we want to collect well we really want

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,320
to collect their perspective we want to

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,270
know not only what people did but what

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,310
they were thinking at the time and why

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,320
they thought what they thought or why

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,840
they did what they did what information

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,290
was at hand when it comes down to

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,390
blameless post-mortems the real

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:33,060
motivation that john also had wasn't

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,010
that really we want to avoid

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,440
responsibility or blame it was the

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,330
notion that people try to do the best

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,130
work that they can we all try to go to

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,840
work and think we're gonna have a great

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,030
day we're gonna be productive and when

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,590
something goes wrong it's usually

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,140
because we didn't have the information

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,270
that we needed and providing that

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,640
information is one of the first steps to

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,900
building better systems and that's what

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,480
we're trying to learn and post-mortems

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,550
so gathering people's perspectives and

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,440
what they thought understanding what

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,240
information was at hand and then

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,680
planning to change that in the future

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,390
and provide more information is critical

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,360
as you start to gather information from

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,400
people it's often easy to just have a

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,790
chat with people pull them aside gather

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,900
their thoughts and their their stories

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,820
but I love this quote from Richard

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,830
Guindon that says writing is nature's

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,750
way of letting us know how sloppy our

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,930
thinking is because when we write things

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,690
down our logical gaps become really

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,280
apparent as we write our stories so how

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,450
people write down their stories rather

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,890
than just having a dialogue about them

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,450
another thing to do though as people are

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,120
writing their stories is include

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,980
pictures we've heard this pictures are

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,570
worth a thousand words but it's really

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,930
clear when you're talking about an

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:52,770
incident if I were to tell you I saw a

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,990
spike in latency what does that mean

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,820
but if I showed you a spike in latency

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,520
if I took a screenshot of the dashboard

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,790
and you could actually see it that gives

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,360
you a really clear picture

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,750
to what was going on so we know that who

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,330
in the what let's talk about the when

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,520
the one is as soon as possible I know

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,200
it's it's often a problem when you're

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,330
trying to run post mortems and then

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,400
something happens in your system and

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,830
you're like do I write about that but

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,140
I've got to build this new feature I've

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,240
got to set up this new server can't I

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,310
just get on with my life

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,250
the problem here is that your memory

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,110
drops off significantly the very first

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,840
study of human memory was done in the

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,480
1880s by a German researcher named

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,010
Epping house and he because he was the

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,230
first researcher got to name things

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,270
after himself so we have a thing called

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,820
the Ebbinghaus curve the Ebbinghaus

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,250
curve is essentially a logarithmic curve

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,130
that says that roughly about two days

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:54,130
after an event we've lost most of our

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,810
memory of it so if you're waiting two

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,810
days if you're waiting over the weekend

00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,190
to run a post-mortem there's not a whole

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,250
lot of difference between waiting those

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,690
two days and waiting a month so try to

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,790
get things done within the first two

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,320
days obviously within the first 20

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,830
minutes is when you're gonna have most

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,510
of that memory a good way to actually do

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,190
this is to get our project managers

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,780
involved your project managers are the

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,360
ones that are driving you to build those

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,880
new features to set up those new servers

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,290
or that new infrastructure but they

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,810
should understand the importance as well

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,580
of running post-mortems so get them

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,350
involved have them block out some time

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,980
so you can actually spend time to do

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,050
these now I do say try to do this as

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,590
quickly as possible but do understand

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:41,890
that incidents are stressful they suck

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:45,010
so people are under a lot of stress try

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,690
to be aware of that don't rush into post

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,730
mortems if someone's under stress or

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,100
worse if they've stayed up all night

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,290
dealing with an issue they probably have

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,910
some sleep deprivation if this is a

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,780
recurring issue they probably have some

00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,400
burnout so be humane be kind to your

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,960
co-workers or the people that are

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,910
working under you when you're writing

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,230
post mortems give them time to recover

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,490
send them home have them get some sleep

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,150
one of the things that I absolutely love

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,470
in the world is Texas barbecue recently

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,140
Franklin's barbecue in Austin

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,900
had a big fire and I love the response

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,360
from Aaron Franklin who's widely noted

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,790
as one of the best barbecue masters in

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,980
the world he gave his employee a bottle

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,020
of whiskey and said go home get some

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,880
sleep come back in the morning

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:36,430
it'll be okay one of the other things to

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,380
keep aware of as we have stress and

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,470
burnout and issues like that is that we

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,690
do have data skew just like we have data

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,810
corruption in systems we have data skew

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,330
as humans and being humans data skew is

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,940
usually worse than with systems data

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,380
skew can happen in a lot of ways which I

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,390
have already mentioned blameless

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,150
post-mortems but blame is the number one

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,220
way that we get data skew if I accuse

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,690
you of doing something wrong if I make

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,300
you fearful that you're gonna lose your

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,340
job you're not gonna tell me the truth I

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,070
really need that truth I need that

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,190
accurate picture of what happened so

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,530
avoid blame avoid threatening people

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,830
with a loss of a job or removed

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,600
responsibilities but there are a lot of

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,760
other biases that we have there's a

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,890
Wikipedia page on human bias and it's

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,110
just got a list of hundreds of biases

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,000
the most common that come into play when

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,160
we think of post mortems are things like

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,630
anchoring planks placing too much weight

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:38,860
on one particular fact to the as we

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,510
ignore others hindsight bias is another

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,510
really huge one as we deal with post

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,390
mortems anytime you ask somebody why

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,940
didn't you do this or shouldn't you have

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,340
seen that that's hindsight bias you're

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,440
setting up an alternate reality of the

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,060
world you're imagining that they had

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,970
information that they didn't have at the

00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,510
time so if you find yourself asking well

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,150
why didn't my coworker do this first ask

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,740
what information that they have why did

00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,230
they think that what they did was okay

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,180
or why didn't they do an action because

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,830
they were missing some information what

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,320
was that information because that's the

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,640
key for you

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,170
outcome bias is another big one that we

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,190
deal with a lot with post mortems

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:24,010
outcome bias ties the good or bad value

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,549
of my decision or my action to the good

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,369
or bad outcome

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,169
that happened my great example of this

00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:33,230
is I mentioned whisky a few times I I

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,940
really do enjoy whisky I could go out

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,889
right now and drink a bunch of whisky

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,350
and go driving all around town and not

00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:40,899
get into an accident that's still a

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,669
really bad decision

00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:45,289
don't go drunk driving even though you

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,989
might not get caught you might not crash

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:50,119
the actions that we take are often

00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:51,889
unrelated to the outcomes similarly I

00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,570
can go out and drive sober and I can get

00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:56,840
into an accident that doesn't mean that

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,609
driving sober is a bad decision so try

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,029
to disconnect the things that happen

00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:03,830
from the decisions that people make

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,809
there are a number of other biases here

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,639
availability we tend to place more

00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:10,909
weight on things that we remember that

00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,409
have happened more recently try to avoid

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,179
that because often times that will lead

00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:16,220
you to the wrong conclusions or have you

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,409
performing the wrong actions just

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,330
because things look similar be aware

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,879
that they may not be similar and then

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,249
bandwagoning don't get caught up with

00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,279
the bandwagon if everybody's going along

00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:30,230
and you see something that's different

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,850
say something about it make that

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,529
information known the goal of

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,759
post-mortems again is to learn so we

00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:39,259
want as much information as we can so

00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,230
with all that said I want to jump into

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:45,169
how we do post mortems at data dog we

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,179
run very complex systems and we do have

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,190
post mortems we do them regularly it

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,009
makes it easier it makes our systems

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,590
better it helps us learn a lot so a few

00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,480
notes that of what we do at data dog is

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,549
we do email our post mortems

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,129
company-wide so everybody in the

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,710
organization has access to our post

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:06,019
mortems this is particularly helpful not

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,149
just in engineering but if you think of

00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,190
people that are affected they might want

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,659
to know why a system went out if you

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,299
think of people that deal with your

00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:17,029
customers your customers might want to

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:18,919
know why your service was degraded so

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,539
providing that information is really

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,769
helpful for everybody across an

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:26,570
organization more than just engineering

00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:28,940
we also schedule a monthly recurring

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,529
post-mortem meeting so we all we can all

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,720
get together and learn from things

00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,429
because when a post-mortem happens in

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,440
one team another team may not

00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:39,170
necessarily know about it so getting

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,990
together on a monthly basis makes this

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,510
a less stressful event it makes it

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,980
something regularly irregular where we

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,450
can just understand that we're coming

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,390
together to learn and we can learn from

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,980
each other

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,170
so in our postmortem template we really

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,810
have five main sections and the first is

00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,700
a summary of what happened so when we

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,950
describe what happened this is often

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,050
what most people read when we email the

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,760
post-mortems company-wide but it really

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,160
just has a description of what happened

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,050
at a very high level and then we ask for

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,810
questions what was the impact on

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:14,120
customers so again keeping those work

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,700
metrics or that work business goal

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,800
primary to what we're learning about

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,200
then we ask what was this a varied

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,180
severity of the outage you want to run

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,280
post-mortems not just for your critical

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,080
outages you want to run them for your

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,600
medium incidents in your small ones too

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,880
as we start to learn and improve our

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,390
systems those small learnings will build

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,160
up and help us create better systems the

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,840
third question that we ask is what

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,550
components were affected so we want to

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,950
know where in our systems was this

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,570
problem and then finally we ask what

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,330
resolved the outage so we want to know

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:51,950
at a high level about what our solution

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,770
was so this is a little bit of a

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,470
post-mortem that we ran about a year ago

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,570
we had an outage we have the the

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,760
description here that we lost some

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,070
capacity there was increased latency and

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
500 errors but again as we mentioned a

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,540
picture's worth a thousand words I can

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,360
say that we had increased latency but we

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,430
can see this graph from Pingdom that's

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,440
really an increase in latency and we can

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,450
see that not only is it just a one-time

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,970
increase but it's it's going up and down

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,180
so that gives us a much better picture

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,070
of what was happening and then we asked

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,590
these four questions so what was the

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,000
impact on our customers well in this

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,280
case our customers were shown a down

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,180
page and that means that the severity

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,040
was major it's a critical outage what

00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,930
components were affected so we have our

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,760
internal system called McNulty and

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,340
snapshots and some of our crawlers went

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,070
down and then ultimately what resolved

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,190
it was that we bumped up a size within

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:52,460
AWS so we got some more capacity there

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,290
and that actually helped resolve it the

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,720
second part of our postmortem template

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,030
is how was the outage detected because

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,890
really when it comes to learning it's

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,990
about how can we get better how can we

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,910
not only improve the resiliency but

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,610
resiliency means that when something

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,350
goes down we bring it back up faster so

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,600
we want to make sure that we're getting

00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,430
faster at this so we ask did we have a

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,680
metric that showed this outage we want

00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,480
to be monitoring these things was there

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,940
monitor on that metric are we receiving

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,740
the automated alerts because none of us

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,240
are gonna be just staring at dashboards

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,980
all day waiting for that outage to

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,740
happen we want that automated

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,870
notification and then we asked how long

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,120
did it take for us to declare an outage

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,370
so we want to acknowledge when things

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,120
happen and we want to be really fast at

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,880
doing so if I jump into our post-mortem

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,070
how was the outage detected well we did

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,380
have a number of metrics including

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,200
things in AWS and within our own systems

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,940
and we did have automated notifications

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,850
on that we had a number of them went off

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,770
and so it took us roughly three minutes

00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:59,750
to declare an outage on this particular

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:02,020
incident and again along with that we

00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,580
included a number of graphs because

00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,230
pictures being worth a thousand words we

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,920
not only have that Pingdom graph but we

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,660
can see our latency in AWS ELB right

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,780
there our front are on the top in the

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:17,960
middle we can see you know latency on

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,240
our stream which is on the top right so

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,230
we can we can clearly see that we've got

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,330
an incident here the third part of our

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,060
postmortem template that we asked is how

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,520
did we respond so this is where we start

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,530
to gather some of that human data so we

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,540
asked who was the incident owner who

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,400
took control of the situation and who

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,820
else was involved so this again is where

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,770
we ask that everybody question and we

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,140
start to think of who are the responders

00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:48,110
who are the people affected who are the

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,210
people that witnessed this other things

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,820
that we include here is a link to slack

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:55,310
we have an archive and we start to build

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,110
out a timeline and then we asked two

00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,390
final questions in this section what

00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,580
went well because we want to reward and

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,630
promote the good practices that we have

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,169
the things that have been really

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,450
beneficial and we asked

00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,519
what didn't go so well we want to

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:13,590
identify the practices and the

00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,940
approaches that had some friction so as

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,279
I jump into our postmortem

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,470
well how did we respond well in this

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,249
participate in this particular incident

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:26,340
Jeff was the the owner first responders

00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:28,200
we had a group of them we have a link to

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,809
our slack archives and also to our

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,239
dashboards here so if you have any

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,830
dashboards that provide the ability to

00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,320
give you a link to a particular time

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,570
those are pretty helpful we also have a

00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,340
link to our notebooks feature notebooks

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,159
is a feature within data dog that allows

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,109
you to embed actual interactive graphs

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,639
with text but it really could be

00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:49,580
anything for your group it could be

00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,989
Google Docs where you include

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,879
screenshots it could be any place that

00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:56,730
you want to record that information and

00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:59,070
record those dashboards so you can

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,629
understand what was going on and then we

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,639
have our timeline of events so just a

00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:06,119
basic high-level overview of that

00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,820
timeline now I did mention that we've

00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,830
got slack the archive link to slack if

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,070
you're using any sort of chat ops tool

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:16,559
slack HipChat IRC if you're like

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:19,649
hardcore old school system ins save

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,679
those try to do all of your work that

00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:24,749
you can within a chat I know it's really

00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,730
easy for a lot of people to do the war

00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:28,289
room style together everybody up and go

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,720
into a meeting room and set that up as

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,460
your war room or maybe if you're a cool

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,289
company with a knock with you know the

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,960
big screens you go into the NOC because

00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:38,359
big screens are cool the problem though

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,429
is you lose a lot of that information

00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:44,220
what did I say to you five minutes ago I

00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:46,679
think I was telling you about our load

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,269
balancer but I can't quite remember when

00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,850
you have everything in slack it's all

00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,379
recorded so it's really easy you will

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,859
automatically have a timeline of those

00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:56,609
events

00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,679
you just have to point to them now I

00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,999
know that you I said you shouldn't try

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,609
to do a post-mortem while you were

00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:04,999
resolving your issue but one thing that

00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:07,769
is really helpful especially if you use

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:10,019
slack or HipChat or some other chat ops

00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:13,349
tool is it's really easy just to write

00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,970
down a note hashtag it put a keyword on

00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:16,950
it and then search for those later

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,750
so in this case

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,149
didn't get paged on an event and he

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,210
should have he's in slack he could just

00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:26,580
say hey didn't get paged I don't have to

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,960
deal with that now but now he Dan knows

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,120
about the incident and he's working on

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,760
it but when he comes back to this later

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,769
he can remember that he can search for

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,960
that hashtag of post mortem remember oh

00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:38,669
yeah I didn't get paged let's add that

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,090
as a task put me in that page or duty

00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:44,159
rotation the fourth section of our

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,549
template is we asked why did it happen

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,649
this is really the guts of it it's where

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:52,889
we do the deep dive into the technical

00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:54,510
reasons of what went wrong so in this

00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:55,950
particular post-mortem I'm not going to

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,549
go into it it's really interesting

00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:01,200
though that's a link to our Status page

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:04,590
which has a deeper explanation and that

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,809
actually alexia our CTO actually did a

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,300
meetup presentation on what went wrong

00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:12,000
for this particular incident it's a

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:16,889
interesting case study of VMs and how

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,750
vm's process work and then finally the

00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,000
fifth section of our postmortem template

00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:23,579
is the most important and that fifth

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,619
section is really how do we prevent this

00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:27,810
in the future how do we get better build

00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:30,540
better systems so we break this down

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:33,869
into really three sections that we call

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,490
now next and later now is the things

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,639
that we absolutely have to do right now

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,010
we have to prioritize this work and do

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,950
it immediately otherwise this incident

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,839
will happen again next is things that we

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,940
can set aside and do them in the next

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,409
sprint cycle we want to be sure that

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,720
they get done we want to do them quickly

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,569
but they don't necessarily need to

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,030
happen immediately and then laters for

00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:59,089
anything that might take some extra work

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,560
or it might take some team collaboration

00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:03,930
oftentimes when we build complex systems

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,060
if we're building multiple services it

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,609
may take some coordinate coordination

00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,829
with other services or other teams so

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:12,180
you don't want to forget about those you

00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,160
do want to work with those teams but

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,170
it's going to take some time to sync up

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,200
your time tables to get everybody's work

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,609
you in alignment in order to be able to

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,280
work on those and make those serious

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,960
changes now an important thing here is

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,609
that you have to link to your github

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,860
issues you have to link to your Trello

00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:30,960
cards or your JIRA tickets

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,760
keep track of your work keep track of

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,770
the things that you have to do otherwise

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,450
they will slide off of your radar you'll

00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,430
just get caught up in that next thing

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,640
you have to build or that next feature

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,890
that you want to deploy so if I jump

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,600
into our post-mortem looking here how do

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,300
we prevent it in the future well we had

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,910
really two tasks the first one got done

00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,910
by Mira and Kyle we have links to the

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,740
Trello cards and the github commit and

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,590
then we also have a second issue that

00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,270
didn't get done and including notes in

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,040
your post mortems is very important in

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,170
this case we did have a note here that

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,960
Mira noted it wasn't particularly

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,690
applicable as she investigated the issue

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,580
so keeping notes along with your cards

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,530
or along with your post mortems are key

00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,290
so you can track those learnings as

00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,150
things get tackled

00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:20,880
so just to recap there are five sections

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,260
in our postmortem template the first is

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,090
the what happened that high-level

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,040
summary the thing that you can share

00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,620
across your organization so everybody's

00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,630
learning the second is how did you

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,640
detect it you want to get faster you

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,310
want to get better at this process so

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,670
make note of the metrics that you have

00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,170
the automated alerts that you have

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,850
create them if you don't have them the

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,740
third is how did you respond this is

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,960
where you gather that human element talk

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,550
to everybody that was involved the

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,800
responders and the people who are

00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,090
affected gather their stories gather the

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,660
information that they had at the time

00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:56,970
what they understood about the system

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,740
the fifth is the deep dive go deep goes

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,140
deep as you can find out those issues

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,390
learn a lot about your systems and the

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,210
systems that you're running and then the

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,490
final one is the action steps make sure

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,800
you have good actionable next steps

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,320
track them in whatever system you're

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,240
using to track your tickets and ensure

00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,870
that they get done take those notes if

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,870
need be

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,860
so more resources that are available I

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,450
know I just mentioned this post-mortem

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,520
template but I do have it available as a

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,370
Google Doc so feel free to hit that link

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,530
make a copy of it start using it within

00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,540
your own organization I've added some

00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,400
notes along with each section so that

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,530
should help you understand what the

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,080
sections about help you provide some

00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,610
more of that information and then a

00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,550
friend of mine Jason hand who works at

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,050
Victor ops

00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,660
has recently published a book called

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,370
post-incident reviews he really hates it

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,430
when I say post-mortems because he

00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,260
thinks that it's a bit morbid so post

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,120
censor your incident reviews is what he

00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,770
calls it but it's a great read so I

00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,670
highly recommend that you go there and

00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:03,150
you download that book and with that I'm

00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,150
open for questions

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,550
yeah up here

00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,550
[Music]

00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,470
yeah so the question is how long does it

00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,450
take to get a post-mortem together and

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,870
who is actually contributing to the

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,970
document so for us usually when I see

00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,070
post mortems getting emailed it's within

00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,170
a few days and you know that they try to

00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,570
create the post-mortem within you know

00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,490
the first couple days but often times

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,110
that then gets sent around within the

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,510
team for everybody else to add their

00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:38,490
information do a little bit of editing

00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,710
and then they send it out so yeah

00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:43,140
usually within that first two days and

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,330
then the people involved really is that

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,130
the first responder so all the engineers

00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:50,010
that were involved and then oftentimes

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,810
you know anybody else that may have been

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,120
a part of that incident so we also do

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,890
have an outage channel in slack a lot of

00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,570
to people will jump in there a lot of

00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:00,180
times those people will also contribute

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,270
I see another question up here in the

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,270
front

00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,360
so the question is do we have any sort

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:18,630
of tool that stores all of the

00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,980
post-mortems that we that we do so at

00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,750
this point we do a some more post

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,540
mortems in our notebooks which do get

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:26,400
stored in data dog but most of our post

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,410
mortems actually these days are Google

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
Docs and so we just have a giant folder

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,490
with all of them we also have an

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,380
interesting Trello board so for those

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,140
who aren't familiar with Trello Trello

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,700
is a Kanban style tracker so you have

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,360
columns and you have cards it makes a

00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,730
giant grid Alexia has actually created a

00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,250
Kanban board sort of style thing for our

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,780
post-mortems so all of the post-mortems

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,880
essentially become cards and every

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,560
column is a month and it gives him a

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,930
nice high-level overview to see what's

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,330
gone on in a month start to be able to

00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,190
visualize you know if there's any sort

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,130
of pattern so I think he color codes

00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:05,160
them around components or around the

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,480
topics but it gives them a good fast way

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,300
to see what the count is and what

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,530
they're about and as we get better

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,530
hopefully we have less of those

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,109
yes so the question as I understand it

00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:31,020
is automation helps reduce friction is

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:33,150
there any automated way that we can sort

00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,790
of do post-mortems or or start to

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:38,700
automate the learnings that's a good

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,640
question I don't have any tools that

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,510
actually automate this it really does

00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,609
come down for us to having the people

00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:50,069
you know start to do it and and making

00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,530
that process really just a habit and a

00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:54,359
practice that everybody just knows when

00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,910
there's an issue you've got to do a

00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:59,160
post-mortem so it really just has become

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,220
habit I see a hand back there in the

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,480
middle also I'm getting a flashing five

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,480
sign so we got five minutes left

00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,569
so the question is we since we email

00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:17,760
post-mortems across the company does

00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:21,089
that make people want to be less honest

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,040
no from not from what I've seen and I

00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:25,770
think that's largely a cultural issue is

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,720
that we we do have a culture that's

00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,030
really blameless that understands that

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,740
things happen and so people are

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:36,390
generally really honest about what's

00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:38,430
gone on and that just leads to to more

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,309
honesty with it within our company

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,930
culture so you know as you understand

00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:44,670
when when people are honest and when

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,890
nobody's blaming you and when nobody

00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,900
gets reprimanded or have this is

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,030
responsible run sponsibility is taken

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,400
away it makes it easier for you to be

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,750
honest and it also as as you see that

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,630
and you see other people being very

00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,430
honest about hey I did this thing

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,130
because I thought it was okay that

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,470
here's the information I had when I see

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,359
that and then I have an outage you know

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:09,349
that I do naturally have that that

00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:11,910
tendency of like that was a dumb move

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:13,980
but as I think about it and as I look at

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,200
our practices it becomes much easier to

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,640
be like you know that it was kind of

00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,220
dumb but I didn't have that information

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,440
and I'm just gonna own that and send

00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,900
that out so building those those good

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,440
cultures definitely plays into that up

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,440
here in the front

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:44,089
just went the wrong way you probably

00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:44,089
want that one or did you want okay yeah

00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,860
yeah so the question is how much time

00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,990
does it take to actually do these

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,190
because it sounds like it takes a lot of

00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:09,490
time generally they do take a fair bit

00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:13,300
of time to run I have noticed that over

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,250
the past probably the past year since

00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,070
I've been studying post-mortems and

00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:20,260
working on this talk people have gotten

00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,720
a little bit lacs about filling out all

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,120
the sections in great detail but they do

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,480
hit the main points so it really comes

00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,580
down to a balance you know ideally

00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,350
selling it to management as you know not

00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,360
being a time waste is that if we're

00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,220
learning about our systems and these

00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,550
helped us to build better systems and

00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,110
stay more reliable because we're we know

00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,180
the faults in our systems and we can

00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,460
address them then overall it's going to

00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,160
be a good thing so it is that balance of

00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,890
well do you want me to spend an hour on

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,870
it now or two hours on it now or as I

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,760
mentioned for the the calculations of

00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,890
downtime assuming you're a medium-sized

00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,470
business is that worth an hour of

00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:08,650
downtime later that's going to cost us

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:11,200
$200,000 any other questions no all

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,480
right well I'm going to throw my info

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,130
back up here just in case you do have

00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,120
questions feel free to hit me up on

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:21,120
