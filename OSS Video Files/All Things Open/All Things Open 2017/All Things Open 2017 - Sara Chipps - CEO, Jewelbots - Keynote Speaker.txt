	00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,850
so good morning my name is Sarah I've

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,450
been a software developer for 16 years

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,400
I've been building hardware for for let

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,620
me tell you how different that is and if

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,269
you'd like to learn more come to my next

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,940
talk at 2:30 and we could talk about all

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,800
the tears that go into transitioning

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,050
from software to hardware it's been a

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,660
fun journey so I work on a company

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:33,420
called Joel BOTS we make smart

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:37,280
programmable friendship bracelets I can

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,280
see this room is full of our demographic

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,280
but I'm gonna talk to you a little bit

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,840
more about the folks that we do serve

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
and serving in different kind of

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,800
community and open source we have tiny

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,899
little open-source developers and they

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,579
are the absolute cutest and just the

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,020
best so for this morning's talk I'm

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,719
gonna talk to you a little bit about our

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,550
audience and why they're so great I'm

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,500
gonna show you guys the magic of Joel

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,689
BOTS and for this afternoon I'm gonna

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,280
open up more into the technology that

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,100
drives Joel BOTS it's actually a pretty

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,720
advanced technology none of the things

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,280
you guys are wearing right now are as

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
advanced as jewel BOTS not even your

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,180
phone and talking about building and a

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,490
C++ API with kids in mind we have kids

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,890
writing C++ and they are crazy stoked

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:32,670
and we're gonna do some live coding

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:36,390
which is always really fun okay so I'm

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,670
gonna do some questions for y'all if you

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,710
could raise your raise your hand if you

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,939
started coding when you were younger

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,670
than 20 years old well look around I

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,189
want to say that's about 80% of the room

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,790
okay keep them up keep them up okay if

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,299
you are younger than 15 keep your hands

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,369
down

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,290
sorry keep your hands up if your

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,930
although 15 put your hands out okay look

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,700
around I think about half of the people

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,649
in this room we're younger than 15 years

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,579
old when they started coding that is

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,390
very cool

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:13,560
you put your hands down no I was 11 I

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,330
was a homeschooled kid I didn't have any

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,010
friends there's a whole generation of us

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,959
I think that became coders because we

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,170
didn't have friends I know some of you

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,349
know what I'm talking about this is

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,099
before the internet was a thing and I

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,190
discovered BBS's

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,019
and that was the coolest thing so I hung

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,430
out with a bunch of people and they

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,560
looked about your age there were about

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,129
your age online all day when I was 11

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:45,230
which is I'm alright but I think so one

00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:47,580
thing I learned looking around in

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,280
throughout through my people one thing I

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,459
learned talking to my peers when I was

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,800
trying to figure out why I was five

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,930
years into my career until I worked with

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,780
another woman and another five years

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,180
after that until I worked with another I

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,519
started talking to the programmers I did

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,209
work with and finding out how they got

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,980
started and to reverse engineer that to

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,050
try to appeal to this audience is what

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,400
we've been working on but I'm gonna tell

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,680
you a little bit about this audience and

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,159
why they rule your life give me a second

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,010
I promise you'll believe me who here

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,530
knows who this guy is

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:30,480
yeah Wow that's like 10% you guys know

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:34,140
who this guy is well this guy used to be

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,239
this guy and the reason why we watch him

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,860
in our movies is because preteen girls

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,220
found this guy and they were like this

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,640
guy is a dreamboat who knows who this

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,269
guy is

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,760
yeah all right well I am proud to tell

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,069
you that I was one of the power

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,379
movers and shakers that turned him into

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,780
a celebrity when he had his first

00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,739
appearance on growing pains and we all

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,780
saw something a little inspiring him

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,470
Taylor Swift we all listened to Taylor

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,720
Swift we can admit it to ourselves

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,299
Taylor Swift is here because these young

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,370
ladies decide you know what she's

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,680
actually worth listening to and bigger

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:18,329
than that Instagram snapchat

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,579
musically all these applications start

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,150
with this audience when they decide

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,650
something is cool we start using it four

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,820
years later you don't know what

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,800
musically is maybe if

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,840
don't have kids but you will and I can't

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,390
wait to see the music videos you guys

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:40,170
all make these young ladies futures are

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,480
at risk we know I mean any of us that

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:46,740
have been in this field for more than 10

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,920
years know that more and more software

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,410
engineering jobs are born every year it

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,840
has come coming down to these young

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,910
ladies abilities to provide for

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,950
themselves in the future not only that

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,770
but the Internet is the largest

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,610
recording of human history that has ever

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,850
been created and it is being built

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,070
largely by one type of person and that

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,690
gives us a skewed view on the things

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,280
that we look at every day so this is a

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,950
very important goal I believe so right

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,480
now young women are 18 percent of

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,720
computer science graduates

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,640
there are 19 percent of the AP computer

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,260
science test takers actually that's last

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,790
year's numbers I think this year got a

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,180
lot better we've been we've been working

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:36,140
on it and there are 15% of Google's tech

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,890
force raise your hand if you have

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:43,470
daughters yeah well look around that is

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,080
so many of you okay you guys want to be

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,100
able to retire one day right this is

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,660
important stuff okay so I started

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,210
looking at the stuff that we build for

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,330
boys and you guys get the most awesome

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,940
toys when we make toys for boys they are

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,190
all about building and creating and

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,480
inventing the future and that is so cool

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,830
additionally the things that we make

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,820
that are more you know when I say boys

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,350
and girls I'm talking about things that

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,390
are more masculine and more feminine

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,120
there are a lot of us that love Legos

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,440
when we were little we there are toy

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,670
companies they market to a certain

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,500
audience so your mileage may vary so the

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,180
things that we make for preteen boys

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,600
there's also like a lot of stuff for

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,190
them right there's nerf there's handheld

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,140
gaming if you went to a birthday party

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,850
tomorrow and it was a 12 year old boy I

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,940
have a feeling that you'd have a good

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,400
idea of what to buy for them but when it

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,870
comes to girls first of all the toys

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,710
that we make for them are all about

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,230
consumer

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,880
there are things that they use there are

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,300
things that they play with they are not

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,340
about architecting the future

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,880
additionally now that kids have more

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,190
smartphones girls are growing out of

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,540
dolls a lot younger than they used to I

00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,250
you know I was still playing with

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,710
Barbies when I was 11

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,050
but now Barbies demographic is 4 to 8

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,820
years old when it comes to 8 to 14 year

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,920
old girls there isn't a product that

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:14,610
really owns this audience so I talked to

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,800
literally 200 girls and first of all

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,270
that was super fun my job is crazy fun

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,280
they will tell you when you're wrong all

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,880
the time they will tell you when

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,910
something is stupid and they're very

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,200
opinionated and I started to talk to

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,990
them about the things that were

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,850
important to them and what I learned was

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,680
that their friendship and their friends

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,410
is the most important thing into their

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,270
world right now and I had some other

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,790
ideas I was gonna make a bracelet that

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,910
matched her outfit they were like that's

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,790
stupid but when I saw them they were

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,230
already wearing friendship bracelets and

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,930
when I started talking them about a

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,490
friendship bracelet that was smart that

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,960
would light up when your friends are

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,920
nearby and send each other secret

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,390
messages they started freaking out and

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,870
getting really excited so I was like all

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,550
right let's do that because the idea is

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,010
we see things like Minecraft and for me

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,560
was BBS's and for you it was who knows

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:14,940
myspace Neopets an online game you

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,460
really liked what happens is we fall in

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,060
love with a platform or an application

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,260
or something fun and and we don't you

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,410
know when you're that age you don't care

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,390
about the code you say I can make this

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,730
thing more fun turns out I have to learn

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,030
this coding thing and now because of

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:36,270
things like Minecraft there are eight

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,310
year old server admins running around so

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,890
stoked at they're like Minecraft servers

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,780
and if you would you know talk to them

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,550
about coding maybe a year ago they

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,950
wouldn't have cared but when you need to

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,410
learn it to make your application better

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,940
whatever thing you love better you do so

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,500
that's what we did we're trying to fool

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,190
girls into coding it is working I

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,530
promise

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,840
so we came up with jewel lots so jewel

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,490
bots are smart programmable friendship

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,380
bracelets they light up when your

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,870
friends are nearby so when your friends

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,580
come around your your bracelets light up

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,820
adults do not care about this

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,640
adults ask me questions like okay am i

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,220
excited because I see my bracelet light

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,600
up before I see my friend and what is

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,730
the proximity of this bracelet and we

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,560
don't understand for them it has nothing

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,570
to do with that it's a sign of affection

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,950
I was watching Nickelodeon the other day

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,200
I don't have kids but this is something

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,620
that I do because it's my job I want to

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,240
be pretty fun and it was a whole episode

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,160
about these girls who were saving up for

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,570
these sneakers that lit up when their

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,660
friends were nearby and I was like yes

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,490
we're on to something you can use them

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,830
to send secret messages to your friends

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,390
no girls are not using Morse code

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,310
everyone thinks they're learning Morse

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,630
code we're not trying to educate people

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,760
on Morse code I don't think that's

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,920
making a resurgence what they do is they

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,290
come up with a secret language of their

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,870
own like if I send you three buzzes it

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,070
means meet me by the lockers or if I you

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,450
know send you to buzz it means the

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,380
teacher is looking at you right now look

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,260
busy that kind of thing I parents asking

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,620
me all the time what if my daughter uses

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,100
this device to cheat on her test and I

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,530
say if your daughter is writing C++ to

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:28,780
cheat on our sixth grade English test

00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:30,460
that is awesome so you can give your

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,430
device superpowers with code so what

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:37,210
that means is if they write C++ they can

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,430
turn into games they can make special

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,080
friendship interactions meaning when all

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,520
my friends are in the same place all our

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,160
bracelets start freaking out and going

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,600
rainbow colors they do all kinds of

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,460
funny things and they are constantly

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,560
surprising me with how creative they are

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,100
so this is the technical part so they

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,230
are writing C++ which is wild and cool

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,190
we didn't pick C++ I mean everyone here

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,810
would be like why don't you teach them

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,339
JavaScript or Ruby on Rails or scratch

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,790
or any of those things that would be

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,740
great

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,040
however our microprocessor is four

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,899
millimeters by four millimeters

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,509
you can't fit a compiler on it so we

00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,850
were like alright we've got ik teach

00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:19,769
these can see can we do this it turns

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:22,709
out you can so we're open source from

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,290
our ID to our electrical engineering

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:28,949
schematics to our firmware to our

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,319
software everything we do is open people

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:33,720
say things like you know what happens if

00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,940
someone steals your product if someone

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,860
could build a product that's going to

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,269
get girls coding that is better than the

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,550
one we do I really hope they do that and

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,769
so our users have their own little

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,480
open-source community so they share mods

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,430
with each other so they'll build a game

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,990
they'll build something cool and they go

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,630
on our community and they share it with

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,569
each other and they learn from each

00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:02,940
other which is the best part okay

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:04,110
all our favorite quotes okay um so raise

favorite quote by arthur c clarke i

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,920
think that if you had asked me four

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:59,300
years ago if we had if i could tell you

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,550
that thousands thousands of little girls

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,070
across the world 35 countries we're

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,250
writing c++ and were stoked about it i

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,700
tell you you were crazy but they're

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,790
doing it and it's really exciting so

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,200
we've learned we have a 44 percent

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,020
conversion rate from users to coders

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:24,720
we're about to send our 10,000th jewel

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:26,690
bot to our to the world so that means

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,450
since we've gotten started

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:36,890
we have inspired forty four hundred new

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:39,210
coders to learn and that is in eight oh

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,640
ten months so we started shipping ten

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,070
months ago so we're just getting started

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,010
we do live events and person events

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,480
those are the most fun because we get to

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,630
