this thing I'm no they gave me a

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:10,740
microphone we're in trouble now

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:12,300
hey I'm Chris short I'm doing a talk

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,070
called DevOps read me dot MDE

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,780
people always ask me hey how do I get

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,279
into DevOps well you're kind of probably

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,510
already there so chances are if you're

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,310
working on open source software you're

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,859
there but if you want to adopt better

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,769
practices around infrastructure and

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,330
DevOps apparently I'm somebody that too

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,670
gets asked that question so what do i do

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,090
on the manager of DevOps a bank rate we

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,410
do financial services marketing what

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,690
does the manager of DevOps do I'm still

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,000
figuring that out but you'll get an idea

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,760
after the slides hopefully I also

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,730
contribute to open source com might be

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,899
why I'm here today no comment on that

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,280
anyway so let's get started the Phoenix

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,670
project the book that kind of launched

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,879
DevOps books right so great book it's

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,920
like a novel it's very easy to read

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,670
highly recommend it you can give it to

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,780
your corporate executives and they'll

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,520
read it and they'll be like hey we need

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,989
to do this and in that book there's a

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,400
character named Brent and Brent does all

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,380
the work and Brent is constantly

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,490
backlogged and has too much work in

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,600
progress and founders you know a Brent

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,500
go help Brent

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,220
give Brent the book to the DevOps

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,650
handbook is the follow-on to the Phoenix

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,210
project and one thing I like to say is

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,189
that if you're quoting this book chances

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:31,439
are you are DevOps seen but it's more of

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,470
a use case kind of thing where the novel

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,180
kind of goes through how the process

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,780
goes this kind of tells you how to

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,340
actually do it who has read the twelfth

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,530
vector app it's literally a website

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,810
there are so many people and ops that

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,270
have never read it so they don't

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,710
understand like what do you mean no

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,000
state in my application

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,610
what do you mean like server Leslie

00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,390
what's that so twelve factor app will

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:05,070
tell you exactly how to do like DevOps

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,719
style deployments and coding release it

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,910
so this one's kind of funny because it's

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,000
like in between editions it's by Michael

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,370
Nygaard great book

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,530
but it's not released yet coming later

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:23,660
this year the book called release it's

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,760
not out but great book on kind of being

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,390
very technical software deployments

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,490
software development life cycles

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,660
continuous delivery by J's humble and

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,660
David fairly awesome book you can give

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,520
it to your CTO and explain that

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,380
continuous delivery will help them with

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,330
the acronyms they're they care about ROI

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:49,310
you bet all that fun stuff

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,030
the site site reliability engineering I

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,830
love this book

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,480
it's great I'm like a per chapter basis

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,320
but when you consume the whole thing you

00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,590
go to sleep it's better than unisom but

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,050
what it'll tell you is if you have a big

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,880
pile of money and you set it on fire by

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,410
giving it to engineers they can solve

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,390
lots of problems like Kelsey said

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,830
yesterday like Google has a lot of

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,220
problems they don't have all the answers

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,510
so remember you're not Google don't try

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,160
and implement everything in this book

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,019
but you can learn so much from this book

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,640
and it's free it's online Google gives

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,110
you something for free every day and

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,049
you're not the product you don't have to

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,269
sign in to get it that's great the

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,630
enterprise DevOps playbook shorter play

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,900
shorter book shows that traditional IT

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,670
enterprises can work in a DevOps model

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,549
you can't use ITIL as a handbook sorry

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,870
but you can do DevOps things to keep

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,340
your developers and your operations

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,390
people happy they do work together

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,459
somehow the open organization guide to

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,850
IT culture change culture is such a big

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,000
deal with DevOps if you're not embracing

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,780
the culture you're not doing anything to

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,989
help yourself

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,540
so this book kind of like the sre book

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,410
is a series of essays put together by

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:06,170
various authors from the open org to

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,769
help people with transitions into more

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,720
open cultures Lean Enterprise this is

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,250
not a weight loss book this will

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,880
actually teach you things about being

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,090
faster in your organization give it a

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,849
read beyond blame who likes to be blamed

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,610
when things break I mean I'm an ops guy

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,500
I break stuff all the time

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,050
admit it it's nice not to be blamed for

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,270
it so read the book it'll teach you how

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,500
to not to get blamed for stuff

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:38,530
this one is earth-shatteringly scary

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,330
it's done by dr. Robert cook basically

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,849
he talks about how complex systems fail

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,449
and you're the human you're the problem

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,909
so address that in search of certainty

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,759
the only things that are certain death

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:54,520
taxes and pager Duty you will get paged

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,229
this helps you deal with that and like

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,120
15 seconds left on the clock the upside

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,669
of stress is if you teach yourself

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,949
stress is good you're gonna be okay

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,330
and the art of war if you're in business

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,219
chances are the business people you're

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,610
around have read it you should read it

00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:12,539
too and last a quote from Andrew Klay

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,539
Shafer thank you very much

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,770
all right ask Chris to stay on stage

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,400
because we actually have a kind of a

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,960
special announcement to make so one of

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,150
my new community building things is

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,790
going to be to build a devops community

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,380
on open source calm right now we're just

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,440
calling it the open source calm DevOps

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,450
team very creative right but really we

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,300
want to explore the intersection of open

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,220
