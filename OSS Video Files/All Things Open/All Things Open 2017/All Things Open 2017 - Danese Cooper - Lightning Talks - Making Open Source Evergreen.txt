hi so I'm gonna be sort of in the

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,960
business of a history lesson and I hope

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,450
you'll all interact with me as we do

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,370
this ready when you are so I'm here to

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,740
talk about the real sustainability issue

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,750
and inner source which is not the fact

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,520
that cut some companies free load or

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,710
free ride and don't pay their dues

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,109
that's not really a problem the problem

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,939
is not knowing how to make the right

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,640
choices for the future of the movement

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,260
and so I'm interested in talking about

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,660
those choices through the lens of

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,110
history so first of all we won yeah yes

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,760
everybody can clap now you might be

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,200
getting tired of hearing that we won but

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,790
as somebody who spent the last twenty

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,350
years talking and at the beginning it

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,710
was a bit of an echo chamber it's pretty

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,079
amazing to me so and that means that we

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,210
have a whole new influx of recruits

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,940
people are flooding into the open source

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,559
world and they have great intentions and

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,420
they're they're excited and they have

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,820
all the energy that I had 20 years ago

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,190
and and it's really super good that

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,500
they're here however they don't really

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,699
understand or don't seem to understand

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,100
this standing on the shoulders of giants

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,530
concept there's a lot of I mean

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,810
reinventing or I'm taking ownership and

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,990
I get that impulse but I think this was

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,890
an important thing so now a quiz who

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,740
knows who this is anybody that is Bill

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,140
joy arguably the first open source

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,119
developer he created the BSD project

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,720
because he thought that he could port

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,960
UNIX to work on a PDP when he was a cow

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,670
this one good job that's what your

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,409
Stallman and you all guys you guys all

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,000
know what he did even though we're

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,500
talking about open source today it

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,090
wouldn't exist without the free software

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,479
movement and without his vision to do

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,750
that he's kind of our Moses in a way

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:48,780
this guy Larry wall larry wall wrote

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,820
pearl pearl is why Tim O'Reilly got

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,290
interested in open source Perl was the

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,479
first really diverse open source

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,310
community because he wanted to see women

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,530
take an equal role the first president

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,140
of his foundation was a woman how about

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,409
this one

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,420
anybody that is ian Murdoch he started

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,340
Debian unfortunately we lost him a

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,730
couple of years ago now almost two years

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,890
ago now brilliant brilliant guy the open

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,690
doc open document

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm sorry the thing that Theo that the

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,360
OSI uses to say whether or not a license

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,090
is open was sort of his alright brian

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,819
behlendorf you guys know Brian started

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,310
Apache he was a kid he was like why

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,440
can't we all play together here but this

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,680
one anybody that is Mitchell Baker she

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,420
was fired from her job by AOL for

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,160
vetting changes through the community

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,900
process they thought she was the problem

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,489
she went home dusted herself off and

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,709
continued to run her project from her

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,350
house and all of the engineers continued

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,440
to defer to her okay how about this one

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,160
and why is Tim in here he made money we

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,620
don't like him right no for many years

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,630
Tim hosted meetings and get-togethers

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,970
and helped us work through our early

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,500
problems so this is my version of the

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,080
timeline if you guys saw the keynotes

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,290
yesterday this is not my resume this is

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,910
open sources resume up to 2000 and if

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,440
you guys have been down to the OSI booth

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,780
you have an opportunity to put yourself

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,340
on this timeline wherever it is you come

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,350
in and of course it's a longer one than

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,070
when they have one more here Oh anybody

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,079
know this guy this is Josh burkas he's

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,880
just a regular guy he's very involved in

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,530
Postgres but he's not a luminary like

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,100
some of the other people but what he is

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,079
is really brave and what he did is write

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,360
this post while he was an employee of

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,910
Sun Microsystems why was this brave

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,160
because this was telling son they were

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,660
screwing up you don't have to write any

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,660
of this down just look for Josh burkas

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,000
destroy and you'll find that blog that's

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,519
bravery now we're gonna switch and talk

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,150
about companies companies optimized for

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,130
profit

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,290
most companies optimized for profit

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,590
unless it's a B Corp that is optimizing

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,420
for for benefit and that's important to

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,239
you because it helps you understand why

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,650
they like to massage the message so much

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
okay they really really like to massage

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,579
the message they like to say things that

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,650
aren't necessarily true one of your jobs

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,739
as an employee of that company is to

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,720
call that out it's scary but it's worth

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,180
doing even some of our best friends need

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,620
to hear that from time to time I like

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,380
red hot as a company and I'm really glad

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,020
that they support this conference but

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,660
they had to be reminded by the reverse

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,220
engineering of their operating system

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,530
when they stopped posting code changes

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,419
right personally I think that open

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,360
source is already a masterpiece and does

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,849
not need editing and so coming up with

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,500
new licenses that force people to pay if

00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,810
they use the code all of that stuff I

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,479
know from my 20 years that that is wrong

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,400
I know that open-source developers are

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,740
superheroes and have the power to keep

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,120
this thing going but the new kids need

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,800
to know a little bit more and that's why

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,200
we're doing the open sources three book

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,880
which is stories from the trenches of

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,849
open source that we forgot to write down

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,200
while we were living them so if you have

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,640
a good story that you think should be in

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,440
there by the way this is the

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,360
gratuitousness you know my boss sent me

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,789
here kind of thing but I'm gonna keep

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,950
talking about the other side please come

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,720
to us and tell us that story or write it

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,760
down at open source calm and we'll find

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,950
it but we're actively editing stories

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,020
from now until May into a book that is

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,190
advice for the trenches okay

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,420
thank you very much

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,420
