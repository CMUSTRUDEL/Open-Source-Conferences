	00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,649
afternoon my name is Ian Fleming the CEO

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,269
of get links and get links is an

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,710
enterprise SAS solution that helps

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:17,699
companies monitor their use of

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:23,609
open-source so they can we go back start

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:25,080
with the end in mind good alright so the

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,680
rate at which we're using open-source

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,320
today is increasing exponentially

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,910
I mean who would at that.you anybody can

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,890
just go on the web grab a bunch of code

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,770
now and paste it together and now we

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,489
wile out we got the new a new website or

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,989
maybe another application in fact 80% of

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,440
the code that goes into our applications

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,600
today is open source so this is forcing

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,610
us to now think of think of

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,059
cybersecurity and our intellectual

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,890
property in a different way there are

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,140
thousands of security vulnerabilities

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,930
reported every year and there's hundreds

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,960
of open-source licenses that companies

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,990
now have to comply with on the cyber

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,950
front open-source is a new attack

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,159
surface that's growing if you're not

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,150
vigilant about the open source

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,009
vulnerabilities that may be embedded

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,159
inside your application your company

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,950
might lose big as well as the example

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,840
with the recent hack at Equifax open

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,310
source is becoming easier and easier to

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,020
exploit these days so in order to

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,780
leverage and benefit from using open

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,820
session source technologies you really

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,619
have to understand how you're going to

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,960
mitigate all the risks associated with

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,579
it you have to understand fully all the

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,439
open source components that might be

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,680
floating around in your organization you

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,090
also have to meticulously screen

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,790
licenses for open source before you even

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,369
start using it you also have to monitor

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,840
continuously all the thousands of

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,570
security vulnerabilities that are out

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,829
there that may affect you once you have

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,780
comfort that you're doing all that

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,060
correctly you can then allow your

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,170
development teams to really be creative

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,259
and create so we automate that comfort

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,540
for companies using open source we built

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,860
an enterprise SAS solution that will

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,500
seek out all the open

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,670
source being used across an organization

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,100
so that companies can move away from

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,510
having to force their developers to log

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,900
all their open source on Excel

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,520
spreadsheets we do that by integrating

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,620
into the company's continuous

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,100
integration tool which they're using to

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,890
build and test their code no longer do

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,110
you need a team of people to screen and

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,959
approve every single open source

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,620
component as safe to use within an

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,980
organization we can do that in seconds

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,750
and we can comply with the regulations

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,610
and the in the guidelines that you want

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,790
to enforce within your organization and

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,910
we can do that because we are actively

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,520
tracking and adding in new new open

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,620
source vulnerabilities licenses and

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,410
version updates to our systems daily now

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,209
we focus on two things to be unique

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,020
within the competitive landscape here

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,400
first of which is security we're seeking

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,709
- we're seeking to build the most

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,739
comprehensive security vulnerability

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,769
database for open source and we're doing

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,280
that by leveraging both crowdsourcing

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,709
and customer led discoveries we can then

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,959
alert all of our get links clients to

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,560
security vulnerabilities before they're

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,019
listed on publicly available databases

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,570
we also secondly focus on building a

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,320
true enterprise solution that helps

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,390
management see an overview of how open

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,940
open source is used at the organization

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,500
as well as control the guidelines under

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,489
which open source is used in an

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,920
organization now this is a highly under

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,260
penetrated market with less than 10

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,930
percent of of Fortune 500 companies

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,570
currently using a solution to address

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,100
open source risk it's currently a twenty

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,810
five billion dollar market and is

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,820
growing at 25 percent annually so I

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,090
spent about a decade in the open source

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,329
or in the information security space in

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,130
the US Army my co-founder what managed

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,380
enterprise software development at

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,260
Chevron we both understand this space

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,830
and we understand how to how to take

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,919
user experience and

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:33,190
user inspired feedback and build it into

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,229
enterprise solutions again we're get

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,690
links we want companies to use more open

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:48,759
source so we make open source safe to

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:50,169
use Thanks thank you for a presentation

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,970
it's a great solution but like most

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,220
great solutions ster you're not the only

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,259
one that's doing it and I think that

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,979
your your pre transparent showing some

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,940
of your competitors so one of your

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:04,479
differentiation you talk about is

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,819
vulnerability crowdsourcing what is the

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,680
incentive of an enterprise to share that

00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:12,250
back with you it's question number one

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,409
in question number two how big of a base

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,210
do you already have for that to be a

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:20,020
force that's valuable to other customers

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,449
as about to sign on right so this is

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,430
this has been actually a a feature that

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,930
companies have asked us to put in is

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,219
ability to cuss to put custom input of

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,919
things that they wanted to be alerted to

00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:35,020
so we're asking companies now all right

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,930
so are you willing to share that

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,210
information with other other clients of

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,190
get links as well this is essentially

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,469
building in this network where everybody

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:50,860
can can benefit from each other by being

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:53,050
part of the get links umbrella so

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:59,889
current currently so the current status

00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:03,550
of our clients so so as far as from the

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,440
enterprise lead part of our of our

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,210
platform it's still it's growing right

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,819
now because we're still onboarding new

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,699
clients at the moment so two comments

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,860
one is yeah I think he came to the right

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,569
conference cuz Jesse's the guy who's

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,050
gonna buy your company when you're

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,050
successful

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,550
Jesse's with Red Hat just for the for

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,650
the audience the other comment is

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:37,509
liability issues for you guys so now

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:40,430
you're just disclosing to your audience

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,190
vulnerabilities that are crowd sourced

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,370
to you how do you know they actually are

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,650
vulnerabilities and this isn't some

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,979
nameless company in Redmond Washington

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,379
trying to embarrass a competitor for

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,479
example right right I definitely

00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,460
understand that so obviously we have to

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,169
vet and approve all open source

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,210
vulnerabilities that are reported to us

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,810
so we're building it into the platform

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,490
where we we can we essentially have to

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,349
verify that it is in fact a

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,180
vulnerability it also is in fact

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,849
something that's not duplicated already

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,280
on a publicly listed database like the

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:18,050
national vulnerability database but yes

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,500
those are things that we have to take in

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:27,110
consideration in terms of budgets

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,560
available to do this within enterprise I

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,629
would suspect that most enterprises have

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,039
looked at or bought black duck in the

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,599
past since they've been around quite a

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,849
long time and it kind of been the gold

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,690
standard for open source scanning for

00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:44,449
quite a while what what's the pitch to

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,110
the customer about why we're worth more

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:52,009
or in addition to or in place of those

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,050
guys just outside of maybe some marginal

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,349
modules around vulnerability how do you

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,659
how do you get them to say we're gonna

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,669
replace that tool with yours given their

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,080
history and you know the fact that

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:06,740
you're relatively new to the market and

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,870
may not have as long a experience curve

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,270
in looking at all different types of

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,009
licenses and you know vulnerabilities

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,440
and that sort of thing yeah absolutely

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:18,349
so I would say that that black duck

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,979
knows licenses are and they're they're

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,569
the ones that really made that apparent

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,029
in the market they were the first to

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,159
come to market really so licenses they

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,949
they got down security vulnerabilities I

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,300
say they still have some work to do it's

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:34,519
something that they added on to their

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,490
platform just a couple years ago which

00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,649
is great but it also isn't as it's not

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,789
enhanced in any other way other than

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,470
referencing a publicly listed database

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,570
the other portions where we feel like we

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,990
can we can step it up is really being a

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,980
full enterprise solution here

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,180
so when I say that I mean not and not

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,140
speaking bad of any of my competitors

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:02,020
but we also they all started in the as

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,570
auditing services and I believe that's

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,029
where they still are I believe there is

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,520
still more to be built on the on a full

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,500
enterprise solution being that you can

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,990
build in preventative measures you can

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,330
build in recommendation systems you can

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,550
build in heat maps for vulnerabilities

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,140
worse the most dangerous parts of my

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,750
organization but really having an

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,029
overview of the entire organization as

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,060
opposed to just doing periodic audits

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,860
and in an enterprise are you selling to

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,250
IT are you selling the line of business

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,589
developers who's the first point of

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,360
contact for you so a lot of times it's

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,000
it's through the VP of engineering that

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,580
we a lot of times get our entry but

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,870
there's depending on the size of the

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,940
company you have vulnerability

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,430
management in some cases you have

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,330
internal audit in other cases that are

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,200
concerned there are a couple different

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,510
departments here that are concerned

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,250
about open source usage and what's the

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,380
what's the great value that we're

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,630
bringing to the to the table here is

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,550
we're breaking down those silos we're

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,279
allowing them to all see across the

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,560
cross the board how open sources use non

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,570
tech people and tech people alike can

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,550
understand how open source is being used

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,399
and what risks exactly are being taken

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,440
and how they can prevent and improve

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,829
their security and legal posture over

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,829
time

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,660
so three to five years from now tell us

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,990
a little bit more about what you

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,330
envision the the product doing for us

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,770
and and does the buyer change at all

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:45,260
over time I want get links to be

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,990
synonymous with open-source use at work

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,020
right so I want us to be able to to

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,730
provide everything from from

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,060
recommendations to contributing more to

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,710
the open-source community but any in any

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,410
in any way that an organization or

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,060
enterprise wants to you either use or

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,070
contribute back to the open-source

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,690
community get links should be the

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,460
platform that brings it all under one

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,460
umbrella so that's where I see us

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,500
playing in in the total so right now

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,960
we're really focused on monitoring risk

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,400
but I feel like we can we can add so

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,010
much more to development and innovation

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,140
at an organization by really promoting

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,230
the way that open source is used while

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,120
mitigating risk and and so to that point

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,350
it sort of sounds like even if you're

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,400
getting in through maybe the VP of

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,920
engineering in a smaller organization

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,310
this is fundamentally a risk and

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,260
compliance ish sale today that group I

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,990
would say compared to security compared

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,360
to at app dev has a smaller budget it is

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,520
a little more siloed it is more about

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,770
hey let's not get in trouble done like

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,350
let's help the business move faster and

00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,770
you know I'm just curious are there

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,870
specific product elements or or plans

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,270
that you could put in place to touch

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,030
whether it's the Security org or the dev

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,140
org in a deeper way because I I could

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,880
rattle off you know a whole bunch of

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,320
things and security maybe you want to

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,360
work with the pen testers so they follow

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,340
the bugs or all the guys from blackhat

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,100
that are doing fuzzing on the on the

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:13,100
code itself how do you get out of sort

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,960
of this defense audit mode which is how

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,760
you characterize some of the competition

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,950
into something that's a you know a

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,560
little bit more of an accelerant right

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,350
and I and I will say that we are

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,750
currently a solution as that could

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,820
potentially be part of a suite right and

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,670
we need to be we need to be focused on

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,160
building a suite of solutions because

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,290
enterprises focus on not buying a

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
hundred to a thousand different vendors

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,839
or looking at big solutions that solve

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,719
big problems so I agree in the fact

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,519
we may currently go into market be a

00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:49,999
little bit small and narrow narrow

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,649
focused but I do understand the full

00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,329
perspective of where we need to be in

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,799
order to be able to sell more

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:59,409
efficiently into enterprises I forgot

00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:12,799
the second part of your question but

00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:16,009
that's good so maybe back to my budget

00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,539
question when what do you asking

00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:22,519
somebody for how much are they spending

00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:24,139
and if I spend X on Blackduck today or

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,489
you asked me to rip that out and replace

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,829
it with what you're selling me or you

00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:29,989
asking me to augment my spending on

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:32,839
black duck with your stuff so that I

00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:35,539
sort of have licensure covered by them

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,509
and have risk and vulnerability covered

00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:40,399
by you how does that work so the beauty

00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,839
of the market is again there's only ten

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,219
percent of the market or less than ten

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,899
percent on the market is penetrated

00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:47,359
today that means most of the companies

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,739
that I'm going into aren't using any

00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,059
solution at all I'm not going

00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:52,849
head-to-head with a competitor and

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,969
saying rip them out put us in in place

00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:59,679
however could we yes could we provide

00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:03,099
that solution that competitors using or

00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,789
providing for them yes we can

00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:07,399
fortunately we don't have to go

00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,929
head-to-head very much these days as far

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,879
as what we're asking people to spend

00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,819
this is an enterprise product so we're

00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,159
not focused necessarily on on startups

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:19,189
or lower than companies that are less

00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,929
than 500 employees but we're really

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,659
focusing on the higher end so that we

00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,119
can we're adding benefit from the idea

00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:27,709
that you have a big organization and a

00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:30,169
lot of stuffs coming in and you're

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,669
losing track of it so therefore we're

00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:36,930
pricing it as an enterprise product

00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:41,040
great all right Ian thank you very much

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,040
