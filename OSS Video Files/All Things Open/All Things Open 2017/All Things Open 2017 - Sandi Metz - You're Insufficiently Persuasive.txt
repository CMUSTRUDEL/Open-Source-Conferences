entirely happy and some of your

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:12,269
unhappiness is an outgrowth of dealing

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,830
with other people I know this I believe

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,470
this is true for two reasons one is that

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,940
I travel a lot like I make a living

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,350
going into different shops and talking

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,560
to people for brief periods of time and

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,500
I see all over lots of variants of

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,500
unhappiness but also I believe this is

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,430
true because there's a study about it on

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,630
this very issue it's on they they

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,059
describe it as being about the

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,550
distribution and causes of programer

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,350
unhappiness it was it's actually very

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,610
recent it published in one of the some

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,420
journal whose name is too long to

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,270
pronounce this just this summer and so

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,280
here's what they did they went at they

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,320
went on github and they harvested almost

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,180
half a million email addresses and of

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,910
those they suriname li.selected 33

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,230
thousand they sent rounds of surveys out

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,289
to these people so eventually they had

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,229
thirteen hundred and some respondents

00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,869
they use those surveys to isolate two

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,170
hundred and nineteen different kinds of

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,430
unhappiness ways to be unhappy they

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,590
asked people if they were unhappy in

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,150
that way and they got two thousand two

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,380
hundred eighty references to those which

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,659
is about 10 references per code

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,970
programmers are not perfectly happy now

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,710
of course those that average is not

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,700
right does happiness unhappiness is

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,869
skewed and here are the top ten that's

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,970
this is just my slides just ignore that

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,619
and so this represents the top ten

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,320
represent eight hundred seventeen out of

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,890
those 20 to 80 and just take a minute to

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,509
look at being stuck in phone so I mean I

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,090
was actually surprised by that because I

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,180
sort of liked that feeling but couldn't

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:59,100
clearly it is not Universal time

00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:02,850
pressure yep bad code quality yeah we

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,079
hate that underperforming cogs it made

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,460
me wonder if the underperforming

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,689
colleagues were rating the person who

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,129
rated them as underperforming all this

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,099
also is underperforming like is this

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,790
mutual

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:16,050
and feelings of inadequacy boring things

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,090
unexplained broken code yeah we hate

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,980
that bad decision-making it didn't

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,420
really get down to who's who was it my

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,310
decisions that were bad or was somebody

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,590
else inflicting bad decisions on me that

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,720
was not entirely clear impose

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,769
limitations and then unrelated personal

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:35,099
issues that are unrelated to work now

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:37,860
while I agree that while I agree sorry

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,239
while I agree that they and they

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,310
categorize them is internal and external

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,769
and it's true that the internal things

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,120
are clearly matter but for the purpose

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,360
of today's talk I'm just getting normal

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,220
alright those go away and and I'm

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,430
suspicious of this one

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,959
I mean boring kind of feels to me like

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,790
it's in the eye of the receiver so I'm

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,769
gonna for today's talk I'm gonna throw

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,569
that out too and we're left with these

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,549
separate items and I think they're all

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:12,450
caused by the same underlying problem

00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:16,350
and it's other people they can be so

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,880
annoying you and all the problems that

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,920
were on the the prongs that are listed

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,150
here like you probably you're here at

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,010
this conference right you're one of

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,019
those people you probably have ideas

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,569
about how to avoid all those things but

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,840
other people keep misbehaving in ways

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,040
that cause pain to roll downhill to you

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
if only they would behave the way you

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,220
want them to behave everything would be

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,329
better now if you're right but you can't

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,060
get them to agree

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,480
clearly you are insufficiently

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,160
persuasive this is a persuasion problem

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,720
and so now is it time for me to admit

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,760
that I have a degree in psychology and

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,790
that this is something from which you

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,900
never recover

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,060
it's totally shaped the way I think

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,099
about the world when I see people being

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,000
unhappy because they have disagreements

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,819
because they can't come to different

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,340
can't come to agreements I see failures

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,799
of persuasion and it turns out that

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,650
humans are hard-wired to be persuadable

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,329
we are amazingly persuadable early

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,829
humans were weak and feeble and they

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,930
lived in a world that was cold and dark

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,900
and people that groups that could

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,170
collaborate survive to reproduce this is

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,600
evolution at work we are hard-wired

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,070
evolution selected for persuade ability

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,670
and collaboration in humans

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,630
and so there are many different weird

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,070
persuadable and hardwired to be

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,960
collaborative in many many ways there's

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,420
a ton of research about this and I'm

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,310
gonna give you one perspective it's

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,670
famous this is a famous but this guy's

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,280
famous his name is CL Dini he wrote a

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,950
book called the psychology of persuasion

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,270
influence it's sold three million copies

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,980
have been translated in 30 different

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,260
languages and in this book he talks

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,360
about all kinds of research about how to

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,210
persuade people and he ended up grouping

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,060
the ideas of the concepts into six major

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,640
cuts to six actual rules and I'm gonna

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,940
go over those six rules so the first one

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,590
is this idea of reciprocity this means

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,770
that if I give you something or help you

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,360
in any way that you are obliged you're

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,840
obligated to return the favor

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,800
and it also states that you're obligated

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,410
to accept a favor that I try to do you

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,520
now this is such a powerful rule that we

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,330
have a whole set of language around

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,760
people who violate it a moocher ingrate

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,170
like none of it none of us want to be

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,180
that person it's it's evolutionarily

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,590
adaptive because for the first time you

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,230
could give something away and not lose

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,080
it I could give you food or fire or

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,910
safety without having it disappear for

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,910
me I would be guaranteed to get it back

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,500
by this rule of reciprocity so it's a

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,990
way to satisfy someone else with a

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,070
future obligation super useful for

00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:01,600
survival it's so strong that can easily

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,250
be used against you for example some of

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,490
you may be old enough to remember this

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,140
does any know who these guys are they're

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,100
hairy creatures yeah they're giving away

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,600
flowers and asking for donations now

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,310
before they stumbled upon the give away

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,570
flower ask for donation ideas they just

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,390
they skip the first part they were just

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,550
asked for donations and and it didn't

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,280
work very well and then they realized

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,810
that if they incurred an obligation and

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,850
you by giving you something that it

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,680
would be really hard it's super

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,950
uncomfortable to not give a donation

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,200
when they asked for it it works so well

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,610
that you would you would I traveled

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,890
airports when it used to be that

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,680
Christians were full of airports they

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,750
they solicited funds in every Airport in

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,700
the United States and you can see they'd

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,960
be out in the main lobby and all the

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,070
passengers that were going by all the

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,930
travelers you'd be trying to avoid

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,100
making eye contact you're trying to seek

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,990
buy because you have an obligation to

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,640
take that flower when they offer it and

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,070
then once you take it you feel that

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,420
obligation to give them money so nobody

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,550
wants to make eye contact with the

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,170
cretians right in addition it's clear

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,360
that they knew they were violating the

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,450
reciprocity rule because as soon as it

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,740
if you if you if you got caught and took

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,760
a flower and gave him a donation the

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,950
first thing you do when you around the

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,120
corner was throw it away and they had

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,500
some more and there would be a crease in

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,360
a person and assigned to go around all

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,580
the trash cans and get the flowers back

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,950
so they could recycle recycle them on

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,640
the next victims

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:27,460
this was we're annoyed we feel an

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,070
annoyance by these the violation of the

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,660
bargain that we have so much so that the

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,960
port of authority the port city

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,090
Authority of New York City Sudan and in

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,890
1982 there was a landmark case in the

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,350
Supreme Court that said airports could

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,300
ban people from soliciting funds the

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,160
reason that they're not around anymore

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,870
is because we took into court and that

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,880
and this whole operation got banned and

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,010
I suspect it was because of this

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,770
violation of the reciprocity rule that's

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,590
what makes us mad okay so the next one

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,020
rule number two is about consistency we

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,690
have a strong built-in desire to act in

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,610
our own self-image this means that the

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,170
more public a commitment you make and

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,970
the more investment that you make in

00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,310
that commitment the more likely it is

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,080
that you will do that thing this leads

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,640
to some surprising effects for example

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,440
if you ask someone who just bet on a

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,850
horse if you ask them before they place

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
the button and after they place the bet

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,290
how likely it is they think their horse

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,760
will win they're much more confident

00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,090
about their horse winning after the bet

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,860
is placed like minutes later nothing has

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,000
changed except they made a public

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,970
commitment to a certain outcome you also

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,919
may be if it turns out if you just you

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,000
can you can just describe somebody some

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,500
way there's a bunch of research where

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,380
they tell people well you're a civic

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,610
minded kind of person maybe we maybe you

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,080
will do this thing and it turns out

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,730
their rate of response and rate of

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,820
people doing that thing goes up

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,070
this gets used against us some of you

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,070
may be parents you know that phenomenon

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,980
where there's some incredibly there's

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,050
some incredibly wanted toy the famous

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,480
toy the toy of the season so it's all

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,829
over the ads and then your kid begs you

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,240
for it for Christmas and you say yeah

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,139
you bet I'll get that for you and then

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,350
you go to the store and they're always

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:13,449
out and then sometimes seriously after

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,149
Christmas those ads reappear and now

00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,190
there's a stock of those toys well this

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,589
happened because 20 companies realize

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,000
they have this very episodic sales cycle

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,050
where they make most of their money at

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,209
Christmas and they're trying to spread

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,350
it out and what they realize they tried

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,060
a bunch of things are they trying to

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,339
advertising only normal marketing stuff

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,870
now what they realized was that if they

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,510
could get you to commit to your child to

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,040
buying him a toy when they asked you for

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,660
it only had to do was advertising to get

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,579
in January and the kids would say mom

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,649
mom it's always there dad I can get me

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,940
the toy and then they would say I earn I

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,930
spent all your Christmas you got

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,560
everything you're getting a Christmas

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,329
and the kid would say you promised all

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,690
right the toy company's marketing people

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:55,389
are using this rule against you the next

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,829
rule is one of social proof this says

00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,930
that if I'm uncertain about what to do

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll take my cue from others the more

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,810
uncertain I am the more likely I am to

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:10,600
attend to another cube I use this rule a

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:11,740
lot myself I'm a cyclist and it is I had

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,850
second thoughts about telling you the

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,170
story but I'm gonna tell you I'm a

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,420
cyclist and it's comedy going a long

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,899
ride where you let's say do not have

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,120
access to facilities and so you end up

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,350
in the woods beside the road if you're

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,170
with a group of cyclists and they're all

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,370
standing by the road near you the first

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,139
thing that happens when you get in this

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,300
situation is on the on the loneliest

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,660
rural road in North Carolina a car will

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,649
drive by in that car if there's a group

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,910
of people standing there all the people

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,010
it'll be full of people all the people

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,360
in that car will turn and look in the

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,180
direction of the cyclists standing by

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,279
the road right and it's really easy we

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,480
learned early on that I could make all

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,800
those people look in the other direction

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,269
and it is just you get all your friends

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,100
who are standing by the road to stare

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,870
fixedly off in the opposite distance

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,370
it's all you have to do if they'll all

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,930
just look in another direction

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,980
you can watch the heads of the car

00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,329
drives why you can watch all the heads

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,160
turn they're trying to figure out what

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,269
they're doing social proof we spent a

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,140
lot of clear there's we have

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,300
insufficient

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,770
formation so we look a lot to the

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,170
behavior of other people did decide what

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,850
to do

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,500
women were for is about authority we

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,140
defer to people who have authority when

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,710
a person there's two kinds of Authority

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,930
really there's Command Authority often

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,970
command authorities denoted by some kind

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,450
of uniform this is teachers judges

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,490
believe police this is the obey me kind

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,830
of Authority and then there's experts

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,780
whose really have a sort of believe me

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,280
kind of authority we in software

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,380
development we use a lot of extra

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,690
thority I distinctly remember when I

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,580
learned TDD I was a pretty good

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,230
programmer that day before I started

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,570
trying to do test-first development and

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,940
my productivity plummeted nearly to zero

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,010
the day after it was a painful process

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,330
and it did not speed it did not make me

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,010
a better programmer not right away it

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,080
took a long time and some real

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,030
perseverance to get good at it to make

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,160
it pay off but I tried I persisted

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,690
because I believed in the experts people

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,820
that see people that I just thought of

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,310
as smarter than me were telling me to do

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,520
it and it felt like if I just tried long

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,440
enough maybe it would be worthwhile the

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,680
fickleness is super interesting to me

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,980
there's a whole category of liking

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,820
people if you like people you're more

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,750
likely to do what they want now I find

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,080
this interesting because it's so

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,250
bleeding obvious right duh but we don't

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,130
really spend much time thinking about

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,590
how powerful liking is and there's a

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,750
bunch of different ways that you can use

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:39,430
this to get people to behave in certain

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,910
ways we're more likely to like people

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,680
who like us back you can actually use

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,900
there's uh there's a psychological thing

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,030
called the Ben Franklin effect which

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,360
says if you do somebody if you get

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,940
someone to do you a favor they will like

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,340
you more now you can't go overboard

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,510
right it goes back to the consistency

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,190
principle that we've already talked

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,540
about right there's apparently this

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,450
mental phenomena that says well I did

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,470
him a favor I'm less like them right I

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,970
know so and and this is why it feels so

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,460
weird when people that you don't know

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,200
very well or too nice you know how

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,540
creepy that feels it's like I don't know

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,820
where

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,460
the skill of friends when and it's

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,100
because liking is is a bond of trust

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,830
that implies the reciprocal obligation

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,190
like tied up and liking is the fact that

00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,600
I will do favors for you we're super

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,720
suspicious of people who have used this

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,970
principle and seem too friendly for no

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,950
good reason

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,840
the final rule the final seal dee dee

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,510
rules scare see so this is this

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,490
basically says that if it's if you think

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,550
it's scarce you'll want it more this is

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,320
why sales end at midnight tonight and

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,380
why Amazon tells you there's only seven

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,700
of those left all right and it turns out

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,320
that it is not your imagination that

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,930
when you're waiting for that parking

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,560
space that someone is leaving that they

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,750
take especially long there's research

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,190
about this right people that are in

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,630
those parking places know people are

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,160
waiting in they report that they are

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,570
leaving more quickly but if you time

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,330
them they were actually going more

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,640
slowly and that the explanation for this

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,320
is that as well and also there's a no

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,290
tournament here if you blow your horn at

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,240
them it makes it worse they wait longer

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,310
takes even longer if you blow your horn

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,750
and it's because the more urgently you

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,880
express your desire to get in that

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,000
parking place the more value it has in

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,130
them the more scarce it seems and so

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,640
that's this whole book in action all

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:41,830
this stuff now I have to tell you I

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,730
really hated this book it's all famous I

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,080
totally hated it I thought it would be

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,010
really in I was like algae degree so I

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,950
thought it would be super interesting

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,040
and it was kind of but really in the

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:54,290
very first chapter he describes all

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,050
these things as a weapons of influence

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,970
and let me read you some quotes this

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,130
their strength the strength of these

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,900
things is the nearly mechanical process

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,420
by which the power within these weapons

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,550
can be activated and the consequent

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,220
exploitability of this power by anyone

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,170
who knows how to trigger them he also

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,630
says the great advantage is that not

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:18,260
only do they work but also they are

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,850
virtually undetectable they're hardwired

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,040
you get the right stimulus you get the

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,000
right response if you're aware of these

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,190
rules you can use them to your advantage

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,960
or at least possibly defend against

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,399
having them be used against you

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,630
if you're not aware of these rules I

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,200
reckon that you take a friend next time

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,520
you go buy a car because they're they're

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,920
doing it this so this book really is

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:41,089
about sales and even though the science

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,500
and it is fun it I didn't like it maybe

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,120
don't be now

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,589
there's another perspective on

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,339
persuasion one that some of you may be

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,570
aware of certain by the sky I know

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,930
there's a reason he's in black and white

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,510
because it's Dale Carnegie how to win

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,890
friends and influence people the whole

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,750
premise of this book is I can change

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:04,190
others by changing myself now as soon as

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,100
I heard that I liked this book better

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,010
already seen what much more interesting

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,750
he groups winning friends and influence

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,890
people in a four ways to do it in four

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,500
different categories and I'm just gonna

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,850
play them the first category is how to

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,920
make people like you remember that

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,260
science says liking is one of the things

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:27,050
that's related to persuade ability there

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:31,120
are six things in this category okay

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:35,480
that seem good people love their names

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,209
you should listen we should take an

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,520
interest in them you should make it feel

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:41,650
important and there's a lot of this in

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,420
here

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,800
sincerity respect for other people so

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,480
he's the next category's about how to

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,720
handle people there's only three things

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,339
in this category as I was reading this

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,370
book I started wondering if I was a good

00:16:52,339 --> 00:17:00,589
enough person next he talks about

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,290
winning people over to your way of

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,959
thinking this has 12 minutes and this is

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,470
a little bit long don't have an argument

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,250
have respect for their opinions admit it

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,250
if you're wrong

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,299
you can see how these things sort of tie

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,250
back to the scientific principles even

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,309
though these are written from someone's

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:30,110
experience it's like no I want it to be

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:32,630
my idea imagine if you worked at a place

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,610
where this was all true or your code was

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,570
in your bosses tried to talk you into

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:41,890
doing things by doing these things all

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,890
right and finally there's a be a leader

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,680
cause for a little soul-searching huh

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,540
like things would be better if we all

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,860
did this I was working on it when I was

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,930
working on the stock I talked I talked

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,140
to this one and sir me some of you may

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,700
know her she's uh busy in the community

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,290
I talked to her I was gonna read this

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,270
book and she said I read it I can give

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,590
you the one-line synopsis I was like

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,300
okay the one like but with the cliff

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:32,360
notes you bet tell me and she said this

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:35,000
oh that okay you eventually find them to

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,910
be sorry

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,310
it's font problem right act as if others

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,810
are interesting and you oh she said act

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:46,250
as if others are interesting and you

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:48,020
will eventually find them so and really

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,300
the whole book this is what the book is

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:56,840
about it's not about them it's about you

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,580
and that's Carnegie and so now we're

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,870
back to persuasion right you're unhappy

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,370
I think sometimes and so now we're

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:10,100
trying to decide whether or not we get

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,540
to have our way and I know that it seems

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,100
like if you know enough about persuasion

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,300
like you could use this research to talk

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,490
people into behaving the way you want

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,890
them to be a there's no doubt they

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,990
people sell us stuff every day based on

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,790
these principles they are as sealed II

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,940
says they're what be they they weaponize

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:29,000
them however when I look at these things

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,360
I know we have the science and we could

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,520
use sort of stealthy military tactics to

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,840
persuade people or even I mean we could

00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,420
do even better right we could try to

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,750
behave like Carnegie suggests that we

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,030
behave but all of this all of this

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,160
desire to persuade other people really

00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:51,160
depends on one critical factor being

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:54,140
true it assumes that you're right and

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,150
that if they did what you wanted the

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,060
world would be a better place and now I

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,420
think it's time to cast the cold hard

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,100
lie today on that assumption right it

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,000
might be the case that things would be

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,230
better off if you got persuaded maybe to

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,270
you and not then maybe you're wrong

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,700
about TDD or making a bunch of small

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,400
objects or what style guide is Bester

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,500
whether or not to do what code climate

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,750
says

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,170
all right maybe if they do those things

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,550
for you life will get worse and it would

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,810
be really nice if we could persuade if

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,480
we're right it would be nice if we could

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,610
persuade people with facts but it turns

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,740
out facts are scarce on the ground in

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,600
programming but much of what we do

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,640
involves opinions about how to write

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,190
codes it's very like if we knew what was

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,750
right I believe we would just do it but

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,970
very often we don't know what's right

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,830
and we end up in these situations where

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,640
we have long arguments with other people

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:50,460
and those arguments are mostly

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,890
differences of opinion about means and

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,440
it turns out in most cases we share

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,350
there's a great deal of overlap about

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,460
the ends that we desire I mean it's true

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,170
that the problem might be that they're

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,570
actually evil and are trying to destroy

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,500
all your software but that's probably

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,390
not true

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,430
they probably hold the same lofty

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,290
honorable goals as you and they've

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,570
simply chosen a different means to

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,130
achieve that common goal we may be far

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,140
more alike than we are different but you

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,230
never know it by looking at this causes

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,000
of unhappiness and the reason I the

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,380
reason I feel like I know that they

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,450
share your goals as I understand what

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,650
motivates them and if you understood

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,470
their motivations you'd be better

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:33,370
equipped to forge collaborations so why

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:36,040
do we do the things we do and not in

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,950
2010 a guy named Daniel pink published

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,950
this book Drive it's about a bunch of

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,990
research they did it MIT they had people

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,560
do tasks memorizing strings of digits

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,840
throwing Boston hoops do word puzzles

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,880
spatial stuff all kinds of things and

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,470
they paid them for doing them well so

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,760
you get a look you would earn a little

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,830
bit of money if you did a terrible job

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,240
you would earn kind of a middle amount

00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,410
of money if you did an okay job and you

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,220
would earn the most money if you did a

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,850
really good job

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,370
kind of like works supposed to be right

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:09,100
they pay you for your work and it turned

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:12,040
out that as long as the tasks only

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,200
involve mechanical skills that bonuses

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,690
work just like you'd expect higher pay

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,890
better performance but once the task

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:23,980
culture even rudimentary cognitive skill

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:28,030
it turns out that larger rewards lead to

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,970
poorer performance and this research has

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,110
been replicated all over like

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,730
is not one of those social science

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,740
things that is gonna be different next

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,850
time someone does a study it's it's well

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,890
it's well documented that this true so

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,870
for tasks that require conceptual

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,480
creative thinking money doesn't work as

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,640
a motivator now it's not certainly money

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,440
is a motivator of some kind but here's

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,600
what it turns out you just need enough

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,340
like if people get paid enough so that

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,160
the money issue gets taken off the table

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,140
then other things matter more about

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,430
getting them to motivating them to

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,130
perform at work there's and pink found

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,140
out he discovered three things that he

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,480
talked about that are the route at the

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,290
core of our motivation the first one is

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,030
autonomy we want to be self-directed we

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,470
do not people want to be micromanage and

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,320
have people telling this or two we want

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,840
to choose our fate the second one is

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,930
mastery we want to get better at stuff

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,940
we have a deep deep drive to become more

00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,550
proficient at the tasks that we're doing

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,750
the final one the third one is purpose

00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:35,400
we want our work to have meaning and if

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,360
you look at these three things they

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,130
explain open source software so many of

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,560
you have day jobs and then you do other

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,870
things at night and it's because you

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,580
want this you need this and you're

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,650
certain you're seeking it at other

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,960
places in your life so it's not about

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,660
it's not about carrots and sticks the

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,520
science of motivation says that be

00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,860
getting to be self-directed being able

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,640
to get better at stuff and making a

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,410
contribution is what matters to you and

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,240
so if we agree that other people's and

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,550
motivations are these that their

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,320
motivations are as honorable as ours

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,890
then we should commit to understanding

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,330
why our means are different and maybe

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,770
instead of getting them to do things our

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,020
way we need to find a way to collaborate

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,440
we need to figure out how to be both

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:25,530
influenced and be influenced and that

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,700
leads me to teamwork there are a lot of

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,370
studies out there that show groups

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,280
innovate faster and see mistakes more

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,590
quickly people working in teams are

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,540
achieved better results and report

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,730
higher job satisfaction they do better

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,830
and they like it more when there are

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,800
good team so but teams of course involve

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,720
other people and we've already decided

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,930
other people are the source of most of

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,950
our unhappiness and so perhaps instead

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,380
of talking about how to persuade people

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:56,660
the question we should be asking is how

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,220
can we make better teams Google ask that

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,050
they care they have a lot of teams and

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,270
they're good at data and they thought

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,850
they could figure it out and in 2012

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,280
they embarked on a huge project that

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,320
they named Aristotle and it was to study

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,600
hundreds of teams at Google and figure

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,640
out what makes good teams what qualities

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,020
good teams have they started out by

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
looking at all the research have a

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,130
centuries of research about teams and

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,960
then they looked at the composition of

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,090
the groups inside Google they looked at

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,860
things like did the people and the team

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,390
socialize outside the officer did they

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,830
have hobbies or like how were they

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,270
similar how are they different were they

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,860
all extroverts were they all in Traverse

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,330
or they they have the same educational

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,620
background they looked at the data and

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,450
nine ways from Sunday and drew a bunch

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,310
of pictures because their Google but

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,780
they couldn't find any patterns with

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,130
their best efforts they couldn't figure

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,500
out they couldn't come up with any

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,020
evidence that the composition of a team

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,690
had any relationship to whether a team

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,800
was reflective or not personality types

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,540
didn't matter of skills backgrounds

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,860
didn't matter nothing that they looked

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,600
at but basically what they said the

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,930
quote from the paper I read said it

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,430
seemed like the people didn't matter the

00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,610
who that was on the team did not matter

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,780
and as they were as they're trying to

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,010
figure out I mean they knew that there

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,300
was a difference and if they could find

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,940
the difference they could make good

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,900
teams they came across some research

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:15,000
into a thing called group norms so norms

00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,290
are traditions right there's a lot of

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,350
conversation about norms in the u.s.

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,940
right now norms being broken they

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,440
they're unwritten rules about how we

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,180
behave team members it's it's

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,690
interesting that when you're on a team

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,880
you're your proclivity as an individual

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,640
is overridden by the norm of the team

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,050
turns out that people who are late all

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,940
the time if they're on a team where the

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,010
team the norm of the team is to meet on

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,520
time those people come on time like that

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:47,070
the team norms Trump individual behavior

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,680
and so Google's research once he started

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,570
looking at norms they found dozens that

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,920
seemed important but then they would

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,270
find that sometimes they they knew which

00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,950
teams are high-performing and sometimes

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,880
high-performing teams had completely

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,710
different norms

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,020
and so they're still trying to figure

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,480
out what mattered and at that point they

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,800
stumbled onto this idea there were there

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,340
are some researchers at Carnegie Mellon

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,740
at MIT

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,450
back in 2010 that published should be a

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,340
big paper where they were trying to

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,410
figure out if people have intelligence

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,470
maybe groups do too

00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:19,740
maybe there's uh maybe there's a

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,750
collective IQ that mer emerges on a team

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,880
that's distinct from any individual

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,680
member and and that when the Google

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,510
folks started looking at this they

00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,280
finally decided that that was it that

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,580
would distinguish good teams from

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:37,430
dysfunctional groups was this norm it's

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,430
about how team members treat each other

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:43,380
so when they looked into the exactly the

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,600
specifics of that they found two things

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,610
that on these teams on the good teams

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,050
where they treated each other well they

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:53,070
shared these two qualities in common

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:55,350
first members of the team people the

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,240
team spoke roughly in the same

00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,300
proportion which of course because

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,470
they're psychologists they called

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,940
equality and distribution of

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,680
conversational turn taping taking so and

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,040
all this means is it wasn't in every

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,090
meeting

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,830
it wasn't like every meeting had

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,840
everybody talk the same amount it was

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,280
over the course of a day the members of

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,770
the team spoke about the same amount

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,710
over time all right that was an

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,600
important factor the next one the next

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,940
quality that mattered was a thing they

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,590
called average social sensitivity and

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,740
this is a fancy way of saying that the

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,450
members of the team were skilled at it

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,010
they had enough intuition to figure out

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,380
from other people's body language or

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,470
facial expressions how they felt they

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,390
can read nonverbal cues and so these two

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,640
things this conversational turn-taking

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,720
and social sensitivity are aspect of

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,260
something that psychology calls

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,850
psychological safety it's defined as a

00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,980
shared belief held by members of a team

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,450
that the team is safe for interpersonal

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,250
risk-taking it's that sense of

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,440
confidence that the team will not

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,930
embarrass reject or punish someone for

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,430
speaking up they talk a lot about mutual

00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,500
respect they use those words all the

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,060
time on the teams and so other matters

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,560
are important like teams need to have a

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,660
culture of dependability and they need

00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,480
to know who's gonna do what but it turns

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,000
out this thing the most critical the

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,640
most critical piece that

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,860
that you need to know in order to think

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,270
that teams need to have in order to be

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,920
successful is they have to be

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:24,430
psychologically safe and so

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,220
psychologically psychological safety

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,110
starts with you you set the tone of

00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,810
every conversation you're in and in

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,350
these conversations words matter words

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,640
about the past are often about blame

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,810
words about the future about corrective

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,820
action about improving what comes next

00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,950
in the face of conflict uncertainty and

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,350
confusion you should have strong

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,680
opinions for sure but they should be

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,150
weakly held you need an identity but it

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,040
should be small you shouldn't be

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,170
committed you shouldn't be constrained

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,820
by your history if you think back on

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,680
Carnegie's suggestions about how to win

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,300
friends and influence people all those

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,210
things are open handed and

00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,890
forward-looking and it takes they're

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,530
scary to me because it takes a lot of

00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:13,990
confidence to behave that way in all

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:17,120
situations what prevents us from

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,750
sincerely trying to make them like us or

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,360
win them over or be a leader why do we

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,550
fail to trust their intentions believe

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,440
in their motivations to build a

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:31,430
psychologically safe space consider this

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,930
if you were having a heated discussion

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:38,000
and someone accused you of being purple

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:40,480
you would just look at them and say okay

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,380
tell me more about that

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,640
all right you wouldn't have a strong

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,960
reaction to that because you are not

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:52,150
secretly afraid that you're purple you

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:56,240
are not your code you are not your past

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:59,240
you are not your parents and you are not

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,440
responsible for everything if you pop

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,050
the why can't we come to an agreement

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,190
stack all the way down you come to fear

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:12,020
I know this because I'm afraid and I'm

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:13,910
very confident that you are too but I

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,980
also know something else it doesn't

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,260
really matter because it's a human

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:22,880
condition right

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,850
despite it alongside it within it you

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,310
are all good enough your past does not

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,280
dictate your future you can change the

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:33,530
future by changing yourself persuasion

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,440
is a skill that you can learn but with

00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,660
great power comes great responsibility

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,370
if you want to achieve your purpose you

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,000
have to concentrate on persuading your

00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:46,190
team to be psychologically safe a good

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,380
team will always have better ideas in

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,810
any individual and to build the best

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,810
team you must be your best self

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:09,750
oh wait I have more slides nothing to

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,310
use I read that book I read this book
