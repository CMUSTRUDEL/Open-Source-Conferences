Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Diversity is one of the most important topics in tech right now. But many don’t know how to effectively change the ratio. Prioritizing how to do it right and make it work for your organization is important, but the sticky factor through inclusion is just as crucial. We’ll review the top reasons why diversity is stalled in tech and what we can do to make it better.

downtown depression and my parking area

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,730
is actually Smokies which is amorous

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:48,060
though right it was one of the first

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:55,069
items I might see when I moved here so

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,069
everybody a lot but you measure out

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,390

and dillards who Shops at Dillards very

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,950
like them I didn't you know they're

exactly that

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,980
okay I have a lot of presentation or

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:47,250

Thanks check that you need this out

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,300
laughter so hopefully we work with a lot

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:27,850
of different companies big and small a

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:30,210
Google standards are there and I don't

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,860
think the developer expert or a

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,610
Microsoft that me Pete I need community

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,920
relations as well or Jazz foundation or

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,430
no I'm all the Arts to 14 foot one

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,140
complaint about my art you say what yeah

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,720
but I'm really excited today and we've

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,160
talked about they receding inclusion the

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,080
last year I even know there's a long

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,540
conferences and I said hey okay

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,230
I'm one of our chair or I can talk my

00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,810
members to be inclusion I know you all

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:07,690
are externalized here but this year

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:09,730
people that they both have in storage so

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,950
these are we're here very often but the

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,590
question was actually matter why are

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,440
people actually talking about it I will

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,660
go ahead and define diversity first so

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,020
favorites to do scallop submission and

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,480
instead of the full spectrum of human

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,050
thumb interrupted different the race

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,259
religion gender

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,900
orientation in Sochi icons that

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,030
impressive ability and I really like the

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,310
second it shouldn't because it showed us

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,009
that they were to be done between skin

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:43,280
color or gender and a lot of people have

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,470
had this positive confession a lot

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
companies actually even considered a

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,659
flame they've got my style personality

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,520
characteristics perspective even found a

00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:57,889
composition thing you know but actually

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,810
that if you're not respecting me idea of

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,580
diversity they probably not even

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:07,159
respecting the team you're working on

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:10,580
they have a personality so having a

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:12,759
woman's word game creation and we'll go

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,430
back to that again the definition of

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,259
inclusion and diversity than the longing

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,349
where employees feel valued and

00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:24,169
respected and accepted and person fully

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:26,240
participate so pregnant with you all

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,969
because who doesn't want to eat infants

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,840
games where you feel valued respected

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,880
for everybody and most people are

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,169
getting more inclusive environment and

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,419
feel appreciated for their comfortable

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:47,449
actually sharing their eyes and their

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:50,090
truth up the deceiver likewise practice

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:53,029
will have more integrity that especially

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:58,699
when it comes to designing a product so

00:07:53,029 --> 00:08:01,159
back in 2012 people eat and of their

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,919
diversity probably with him thinking as

00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,130
much about what this would be and the

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,620
pants were purple and the rack time

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,870
personality and sleek design and it were

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,350
beautifully smooth and an internet

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,150
especially adored this path they took

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,350
over and if they're creating the native

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:25,900
malaria any longer but this people gave

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:31,979
and patent what a start and he comes at

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,300
you for him and yeah these in there

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,770
because favorite they actually couldn't

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,080
write because these were designed for

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,700
women so I'm going to write more serious

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,940
example of when their problem with an

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,250
entire arsenal team singing about a

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,250
15-hour knee throat centers so he did

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:58,380
and unfortunately it can't actually

00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:02,250
inside our skin so manufacture that

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:05,950
technology computer she senses something

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,320
okay he had more than seventy years in

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,920
Silent Witness have actually happened

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,800
you can find this video music and watch

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,660
another example trying to solve the same

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:24,190
problem in this way you know this is a

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:26,170
cocktail so after it's done fifteen half

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:30,870
of Watchmen police and a lot of

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,870
customers are saying hey

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:55,970
but anyway yeah okay so the Smart Watch

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,910
actually failed to read a full and not

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,880
detect contact our skin and again we can

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,070
say hey this is a technology problem

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,680
organs the paper state problem because

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,570
if you look at the leadership team and

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,940
probably the people who were there early

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,550
testers without a watch you have come to

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,890
a stop think why wasn't this talk early

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,710
on that's a very large majority of the

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:23,510
population now when we look at other

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:25,490
examples like a birth and new kind of we

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,740
were a few years ago went through a lot

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,780
of controversy around driver sexually

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,180
attacked women and some market

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,700
operations went and nineteen said hey if

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,980
you have more women in fact people old

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,590
when they have both gender schools for

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,900
female users to be protected from sexual

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,090
tax I definitely say that if I were

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,580
there I probably would happen is I can

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,610
see how many times that I show you this

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,860
where should I not and when your team

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,860
what's more members they are able to

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,550
meet just really simple basic thing that

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,890
you might not be back in a way right

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,060
decisions like making sure that the stop

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,490
of for example

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,980
personally bring a full versus the

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,890
normal traditional that we can see out

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,020
there and that we move automatically

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,020
matters and of course you know

00:11:17,320 --> 00:12:08,210
so this is a crazy remote data point so

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,820
do the power believe we're they a

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,760
hostile workplace working on the

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,560
company's memory you can absolutely

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,050
confirm smart mature decrease place

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,990
right now and looks increase every half

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,080
so it's really crazy to see an actual a

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,410
little direct consequence of not having

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,860
an inclusive work environment so wait we

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,530
have diverse team are important than the

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,780
other thing is it's hard actually

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:41,170
focusing right absolutely first of all

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,170
how do I actually meet people to hire

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:46,750
so we've been working on some tech

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,480
community a lot there's a lot of

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,270
initiative and you know unfortunately

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,450
still the wash companies like Facebook

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:58,390
and Apple and Google Microsoft either a

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,730
large efforts they're still games crappy

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,960
32 aren't for women in technical

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:07,020
positions now right start using the

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:12,420
measurement on 13

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,420
there are actually four education model

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:19,810
and we have to have tremendous potential

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,089
to diversify competitive market and you

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,980
cannot just leave it in another that

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:27,130
you're looking to diversify your

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,580
workplace you probably shouldn't even

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,920
really be distracting but you look at

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:38,790
putting food hacks in this is where the

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:43,020
diverse pipeline is actually in and

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:57,610
while there's a lot of info right so

00:13:43,020 --> 00:14:03,240
it's so this woman so where is this well

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,240
it's actually very you know instigate so

00:15:08,190 --> 00:16:38,530
to make sure that it start the

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,260
conversation the conversation is not

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,750
already happening the Germans could not

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:50,380
not have to be because it's not wanted

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:54,340
it's not happening right and making sure

00:16:50,380 --> 00:17:05,890
that your if you are but you're

00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:07,500
repeating that including Microsoft he

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,390
shares a really great example of how

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,370
fermentation within Microsoft tried to

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,030
change the ratio so that's one of the

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:20,100
even would ask for a power of three we

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,100
three other month

00:17:20,439 --> 00:18:11,720
in this my employee can clap there fog

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:17,030
right in down a head of time so that

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,980
they can be more active during dude says

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,320
that you know there are so many simple

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,240
things that you can do you see somebody

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,669
single not to take notes and make coffee

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,919
that a woman or not a person of color

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,830
you should speak up and stand up because

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,600
chances are is much easier for you to do

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,660
it than it is for the person that's

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,440
actually singled out if you haven't quit

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,440
things that even

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,139
really because you definitely have

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,690
something to meet you don't typically

00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:51,990
ask about a problem that you're working

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:56,510
on and curves that that connotation came

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:59,570
to your room so you know capacitors

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:04,200
change over your apartment you're likely

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,240
very diverse even learn from meeting so

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,950
the same person in the talking but we

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,010
remember and give people the opportunity

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,990
to use their places

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,789
leaders are some the floor up course and

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,269
also talk about something how many works

00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:21,570
you can on there something like kids

00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:23,519
family food shopping not love then

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:29,090
you're much more likely during a team

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,090
arguments or disagreements to say okay

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,750
