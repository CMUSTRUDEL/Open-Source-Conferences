okay so this kind of follows along to

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,290
the key known again hopefully all you

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,849
got to understand some of the cool

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,010
statistics out there related to

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,260
diversity and inclusion but I wanted to

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,760
go ahead and start off with you know

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,529
defining diversity and how do we do

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,449
inclusion right and what are some of the

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,849
good examples that you all have seen of

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,520
companies doing this right and what

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,350
advice do you have for to give people

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,000
when they come and ask about it let's

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,410
start off with the first one first what

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,410
are some good examples you all have seen

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,800
you know diversity to me is really

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,930
valuing and appreciating all human

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,690
beings and that they're all different in

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,460
various ways whether it's cognitive or

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,800
color global sex gender affinity all all

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,430
kinds of good stuff and it's just so

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,519
fundamental right to appreciate and

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,979
admire I mean include everybody some of

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,560
the best and to me you you cannot just

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,240
top there by acknowledging diversity

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
you've got to make sure that everyone

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,200
feels valued included trusted you know

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,180
appreciated in in this world and some of

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,140
the best examples are organizations

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,970
where it starts at the top and leaders

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,990
totally get it and it's part of the DNA

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,630
of the organization it's not just you

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,200
know slogan on the website it's actually

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,020
lived everyday by the leaders by people

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,170
and in their recruiting practices in in

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,320
how they promote how they retain develop

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,799
you know people I think our organization

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,649
does a good job it's a part of what we

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,780
do you know there are some fantastic

00:01:52,649 --> 00:02:01,200
open source organizations that do a good

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:04,619
job Python Drupal are good examples so

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,069
there you go mmm yeah there's lots of

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,140
lots of diagrams lots of writing lots of

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,440
you know academics about what inclusion

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,240
means in this sense

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,270
diversity means in this sense but I

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,970
think it's very much the the efforts to

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,430
which you go to to understand and the

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,010
thighs include its it's not--there's I

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,960
feel like if you're trying to prescribe

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,370
an academic process to this it's it's

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,730
kind of going to disappoint you

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,860
potentially so it's really about this

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,530
genuine respect for humans that

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,990
sometimes sometimes we don't get maybe

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,370
brought up

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,620
educated it's not part of our lived

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,850
experience and that it yeah sometimes

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,210
there's something that you do need to

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:50,360
work on and discover to really value

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,520
each other for what each other are at

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,100
their core or what they're willing to

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,960
offer you at their core you don't always

00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,730
have to offer everything that you are

00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,770
it's it's sometimes a choice and

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,390
respecting that choices sometimes part

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,520
of your diversity and inclusion effort

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,510
and places that are doing this really

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,810
well hmm it's really it's really tricky

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,140
I can think of lots of local small

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,459
organizations from where I'm back home I

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,959
think I think one of the things we were

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,430
just talking about this I think that if

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,280
you think that you're doing it well

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,250
you've got more work to do as soon as

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,290
you think that you are young they're

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,000
super inclusive super diversity you know

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,290
that's when you've got to think okay

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,390
where am I not looking where are the

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,920
gaps and actually there are some really

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,530
great methods and I know we're gonna get

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,660
onto toolkits later on with how you can

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,480
how you can try and identify those gaps

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,090
in both your organization's and also the

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,190
tools that you're making yep there's a

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,800
lot of companies these days that do

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,320
diversity reporting I think a lot of Bay

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,860
Area companies do a lot of diversity

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,390
reporting to say hey you know we might

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,980
not be very good and we're just gonna

00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,750
put it out there and it's you know it's

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,850
a very it's a very vulnerable place

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,650
because what company wants to say we're

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,500
not actually doing diversity really well

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,760
but as a lot of companies are sort of

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,830
taking ownership and saying hey I'm

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
gonna release these diversity reports

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:17,390
then they kind of have to take action

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,609
right so it forces you to be become

00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,660
better totally agree that was when

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:26,740
things started really changing in

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,110
at least in tech in 2013 you know San

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,120
Jose Mercury News and CNN challenged a

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,130
lot of these companies to publish their

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,890
reports and initially a lot of companies

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,500
said oh it's it's my competitive

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,170
advantage its IP I can't share this

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,000
information and then the floodgates

00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,990
opened when Pinterest started publishing

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,110
information and soon all companies did

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,180
that I totally agree with you it says at

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,060
least I'm vulnerable I this is who I am

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,320
and this is I know I have work to do but

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,940
I'll start working on it

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Pinterest has done a really good job I

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,140
think within two years I think in 2015

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,070
is when they first published their

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,920
statistics and come 2017 they were able

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,290
to move the needle by a few prints a

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,510
little bit under 10% but it would you

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,090
know if you don't establish a baseline

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,300
right and I think encouraging companies

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,990
to do that and a lot of companies as

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,400
well have started to show leadership in

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,730
actually having a diversity and

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,750
inclusion office lately does Comcast do

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,170
anything like that

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,450
yes but I am a firm believer that it's

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,660
everybody's job yeah who create

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,720
inclusion and not abdicated just to one

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,900
organization and I know we'll be talking

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,260
more about that later yeah I do have one

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,810
example of and I know often the

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,360
diversity topic gets really quickly into

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,220
binary genders so I'm just gonna throw

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,390
out an example that kind of maybe breaks

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,460
us out of that track one example is so

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,240
there's a there's a organization in the

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,440
UK called Stonewall it's a LGBT

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,600
organization that actually has an

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,880
amazing champion scheme for like

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,710
diversity and inclusion people within

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,900
companies can take on this award and

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,810
kind of get trained with from the

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,990
organization Lloyds TSB which is a bank

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,580
in the in the UK they did an amazing

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,080
project they had a member of staff who

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,180
was a bisexual man that found it really

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,560
difficult to come out in his place of

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,169
work he was working and behind the

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,110
counter in a bank and from not being

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,110
able to come out

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,840
was experiencing mental health issues

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,129
and they they took a really

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
compassionate approach to this and they

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,919
spoke to him about what he would want to

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,349
do to make it better for the other

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,389
employees of the the bank huge bank

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,819
loads of employees and they did this

00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,710
special campaign around like mental

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,590
health in the workplace and he was then

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,199
subsequently able to be like a

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,080
representative of both by sexuality male

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:06,469
bisexuality which is actually incredibly

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,319
stigmatized and rare to come out as but

00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,840
also about mental health as a as a need

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,360
so that's a really great campaign good

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,490
example hmm I know another thing that

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,960
you're very passionate about is

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,849
neurodiversity and I really love this

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,639
word I've been seeing it flowed around

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,500
the Twitterverse mmm a lot lately can

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,199
you talk a little bit about that sure

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,479
so neurodiversity just recognizes that

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,849
we all to some extent have have

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,379
diversity needs within how we operate as

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,479
humans within our brains and how we

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,669
function but the focus on neuro

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,879
diversity is really recognizing the

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,430
different different spectrums of autism

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,620
exist different kinds of mental health

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,029
needs exist not the autism and mental

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,969
health can be equated in in the same

00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,099
sentence you know they're very

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:54,830
everything is very individualistic but

00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:58,279
neuro diversity really really thinks

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,349
about and tries to accommodate in a

00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,139
compassionate way for people that have

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,509
different kinds of needs reason very

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,919
reasonable needs you know one of the

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,569
things that I think is really fantastic

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,900
I actually can't remember the company it

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,060
might be Microsoft actually yes you do

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,680
an amazing scheme for when they want to

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,110
hire somebody who's self describes us as

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,060
some kind of neuro-diverse so they will

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,819
give them a whole different interview

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,159
track yes a whole different onboarding

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,500
into the company and I thought this was

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,080
absolutely fantastic it's such a such an

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,460
amazing scheme to just recognize that

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,510
this is something that exists and yeah

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,089
we can make reasonable accommodations

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,010
for our interview process for this

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:42,829
actually very much needed in our

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:44,839
industry yeah yeah I remember my life is

00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,180
on Twitter of course and now to talk a

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,940
little bit here you take that I love

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,810
tick tock

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,820
okay we need to talk later for on

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,110
Twitter I remember there was something

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,700
that I don't know if you all saw this

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,950
but it was a it was an AI that basically

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,320
did interviews for you and it would

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,150
judge you know are you smiling are you

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,770
making eye contact are you doing this

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,990
and there was a lot of pushback in the

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,780
tech community to say hey this is not

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,910
inclusive of everybody it's not allowing

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,190
you to be diverse you're not respecting

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,760
cultures you're not respecting your

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,920
diversity etc etc so and also just like

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,440
if you're measuring how maybe somebody

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,480
like anxiety is a thing that exists

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,490
sometimes people find it hard to make

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,980
eye contact some people find it hard to

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,990
not maintain intense eye contact and

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,490
none of these things is the right way to

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,080
engage with a human it's the way that

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,680
our person will engage with another

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,420
human the really tricky thing is feeling

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,750
comfortable enough to and having

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,820
creating a space as an employer as a

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,130
company as other people that work with

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,830
each other where that person feels that

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,720
they can disclose those needs and they

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,690
won't be kind of there won't be any

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,520
reactions that you know they can have

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,830
that conversation but yeah I mean

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,090
imagine if you you'd had like a stroke

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,960
or something like that and maybe you

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,610
don't have movement

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,260
everyone's one side of your face you

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,590
know that's gonna also unless you

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,650
disclose that that AI is not gonna pick

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,090
that up so we've talked a lot about

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,700
different companies and things like that

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,200
but I kind of want to move it into a

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,260
conversation around diversity inclusion

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,960
and open source so a Nydia you work an

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,090
open source leadership what's the

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,060
landscape of diversity inclusion and

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,130
open source lately you know yesterday we

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,510
had a diversity conference here and

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,640
Denise Cooper reminded us that the very

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,460
foundation of open source was by people

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,830
who want to do something different

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:46,350
wanted to challenge the status quo

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,830
wanted to challenge the norms and so the

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,630
roots are very much diverse and respect

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,390
the fact that you know people think

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,080
differently but yet it's been very very

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,570
difficult to see more diversity and open

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,209
source I think some of the numbers in

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,569
open source

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:06,490
the most dismal in tech for example

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:10,059
there's less than 10% woman in

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,749
open-source there's less than 5% you

00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:16,420
know of different underrepresented

00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:19,389
minorities and this is this is very

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,429
troubling but there is hope there are a

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,439
lot of interesting things happening on

00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:26,290
the landscape I think one of the first

00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:28,449
great institutional standardizations

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,600
that are that's happening is code of

00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:35,980
conduct it starts with making places

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,550
safe places easy for people to enter and

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,689
feel themselves be themselves so I think

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,829
that's a good thing there's a lot more

00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:48,249
standardization in practices happening

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:52,209
at events I love that all things open

00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:55,929
open-source ummet ozcan all have really

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:58,779
very very broad set of diverse practices

00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:01,389
to welcome and support people

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,639
I think internships and you know places

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,600
like outreach er doing great things to

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:09,189
create pipelines into open source and so

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,619
I think a lot of good things are

00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:14,769
happening and you know the fact that you

00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:18,249
were on a main stage talking about this

00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:20,319
issue is huge because it belongs on main

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,929
stage it's not something that's supposed

00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:25,329
to be done in in one of the breakouts

00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:29,379
you know where we are preaching to the

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,970
choir so so bad it's still bad but I

00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,040
think things are moving in the right

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,799
direction I think that's definitely a

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,799
huge thing I remember earlier on in the

00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:41,110
year we hosted at this conference called

00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,490
ng Atlanta it was an angular conference

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,639
and we were trying to do a diversity

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,309
sort of roundtable and we were hoping

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,480
that we could reach out to people and

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,879
they would say oh you know I'm

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,549
interested in this but it's this echo

00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,049
chamber effect right if you know people

00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,999
who care about diversity inclusion like

00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:03,129
us will always talk about it will always

00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:05,529
be supporting it but it's really the

00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:07,629
people who don't care or don't feel like

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,579
they need to care is where the awareness

00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:12,459
needs to be raised so I totally agree

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,569
with you like all things open say hey

00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,770
we're gonna make it part of the kingdom

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,870
is

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,900
so important and it's definitely the

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,790
place where it belongs I also love

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,180
seeing a lot of different companies like

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,870
IBM they did that scholarship that we

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,190
saw at the keynote as well today and

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,480
there are a lot of companies Twitter

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,430
actually does a really great they have a

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,260
great open-source program and they try

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,670
to focus on diversity and inclusion too

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,080
so you know it's getting there it's I do

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,220
a lot of open source as well and I think

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,340
what I've seen is leadership start to

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,950
say well I think some leadership is that

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,900
now you do what you want we're not going

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,670
to pay attention it's not our job to be

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,860
leaders because these people are just

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,620
using the software you built but have it

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,540
bite them in the butt and then for that

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,180
for them to start waking up and saying

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,970
whoa we need to do something we need to

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,830
have these conversations right now

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,770
because you know the entire open-source

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:14,100
community has many times especially on

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,690
Twitter gone off in flames yes I think

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,850
with more and more companies getting

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,830
involved in open source we have a chance

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,200
to put our money where our mouth is oh

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,690
absolutely put it into programs that

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,920
benefit a more diverse and inclusive

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,020
community scholarships role model you

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,420
know diversity the people we send to

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,910
conferences the people we send to speak

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:41,100
at events or sit on advisory boards or

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:44,040
sit on boards our board a DLF is very

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,620
diverse it's about five or six I know

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,870
I'm talking binary but it's a great

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,450
start to kind of go there first and then

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,490
you know keep building on that and build

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,780
more diversity from there that's amazing

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:01,760
that's so great so let's move on to the

00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:05,060
next topic and let's just talk about the

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,890
non us-based

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,340
DNI climate so I think a lot of

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,440
conversations that happen at conferences

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,890
and on Twitter especially in the US are

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,210
very us focus it's the US version of

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,760
what diversity and inclusion is and you

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,700
know Errol I know you're you're you know

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,450
you're building a platform that is very

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,360
instrument

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,130
helping marginalized voices be heard in

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,490
places like Kenya and a bunch of

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,620
different other places through your work

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,660
and you know through just in general

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,080
being a part of that ecosystem what

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,770
differences have you seen versus what us

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:50,730
can Western world considers DNI hmm yeah

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,620
this is a really yeah big question I

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,160
mean it really can only speak to the

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,940
things that I've experienced from my own

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,350
experience again the way that I've

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:04,290
processed this and I you know there's

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,780
actually it was actually not a lot of

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,120
difference in the levels of effort right

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,430
but there I hate that this is something

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,690
that comes out of my mouth so frequently

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:18,570
as it does there are I'm gonna say there

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,490
are so many amazing talented great

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,560
open-source developers there's such

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,270
talent across Africa across all the

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,510
different kind of developing countries

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,270
it sort of feels redundant to to say

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,610
that because but I know that it's not

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:36,060
everyone's common knowledge that this is

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,890
but it's like I have an amazingly strong

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,280
developer community I mean it's like

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,050
it's fantastic it's great and one of the

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,850
when I think the best stories that

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:49,830
represents this's is we soceity built

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,660
this platform which raises marginalized

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,940
voices globally so you know growing out

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,550
of Kenya but globally raises voices and

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,070
it's been used by the u.s. to to do

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:02,250
things so when you kind of look at that

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,100
the fundamental like switching of like

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,590
this kind of narrative of yeah this this

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,270
this product that grew out of what is

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,600
considered to be a country that needs

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,730
needs aid or needs help or all these

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,930
kinds of things you know built this

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,340
platform that was used by these

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,950
developed countries it really does

00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:23,400
sometimes switch people's narratives but

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:26,100
I do still find it very unsettling and

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,350
kind of gives me indigestion to say out

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,540
loud to two groups of audiences but it's

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,100
often like what's needed and we actually

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,960
have several sister companies that have

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,140
spun out of issue Headey one of them

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,950
being brick BR CK and again this was a

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,100
set of technologies it's mobile

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,929
connected

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,390
vices that have a lot of data a lot of

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,890
them information downloaded onto the

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,510
devices and they can charge us there

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,910
they're pulled along they were used in a

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,120
lot of rural very remote schooling

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,070
efforts and this was something that was

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,190
amazingly well used across different

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,830
African countries still is but there was

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,500
a really great case for it to be used in

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,870
some of the more remote places in the

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,760
Americas for indigenous communities and

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,539
there was again this kind of narrative

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,280
where you know receiving help from from

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,340
the developing countries was sort of

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,000
something that kind of came for weird

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,799
taste in the mouth but yeah it's it's a

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,860
it's a thriving community the open

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,450
source open source Africa conference is

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,970
just that out call for papers it's going

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,909
to be a fantastically huge conference in

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,650
Nigeria in there and they're doing open

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:36,000
source design efforts which is amazing

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,650
but they're incredibly like

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,830
forward-thinking for sure like why

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,350
wouldn't they be but as far as diversity

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,900
and inclusion efforts go I mean there is

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,210
still you know struggles around having

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,610
more women in positions of power or

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,130
different genders other than the male

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,900
genders our sis male genders there's a

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,059
real there's real struggle in in

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,549
countries where you know LGBT

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,960
representation is really tricky to

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,669
because you're criminalized you know

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,650
it's it's very tricky to include that

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,809
kind of diversity within your

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,000
organization's when you know the country

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,940
structures are not allowing for it

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,190
already so I hope yeah I went off on a

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,010
slight tangent no it's great it's great

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,320
definitely a lot of different nuances

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,360
there to kind of explore and I think

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,010
this is great conversation because again

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,440
diversity and inclusion it's something

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,720
that the more we talk about it the more

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,610
we try to understand it the more we say

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,460
it in different ways the better we're

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,350
able to kind of address it so thank you

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,880
for sharing that

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,770
Nastia so going back to open source of

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,169
course you know this is a very global

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,880
space but you know especially with your

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,630
position at linux foundation on the

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,760
board are there any specific themes that

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,970
people hold on to is there is there

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,010
anything there so I just wanted to

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,679
acknowledge that the more we talk about

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,779
these

00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,029
including pronouns and other things it

00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:02,330
normalizes it right it becomes part of

00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:07,159
the vocabulary it gives us a way to talk

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:09,979
so I'm very grateful for that you know I

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,259
read somewhere that the 21st century and

00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:16,190
I don't need to read it to acknowledge

00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:19,489
it it is an era of unprecedented global

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,789
ISM unprecedented diversity the world

00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:24,739
has opened up like nobody's business

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,929
partly it's because of all the tools

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:28,669
that we create the Internet has brought

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,399
us all you know so much closer together

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,259
I was a grace hopper last a couple of

00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:35,539
weeks ago and I was talking to an Indian

00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,089
student from Bangalore who had been

00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,999
flown all over all the way here to

00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:43,309
interview for a job here and I said you

00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:45,440
know is the tech education the same in

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,019
India as it is here are you guys

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,019
relevant are you guys up to date and she

00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:54,409
said you know school is just one piece

00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:56,929
of it we study online we study in open

00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:00,080
source communities we learn a lot from

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:03,019
that piece more than we do you know just

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,969
from classrooms so the world is getting

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,460
more and more equalized and it's global

00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:09,200
and it's connected and you know people

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,009
are learning from each other some of the

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,219
best practices I've seen is to create

00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,649
global communities in open source right

00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:19,460
CN CF and so many other communities like

00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:22,669
nodejs

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,979
like that you work in are very much

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:28,789
global communities so some of the best

00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:30,349
practices are creating tools that allow

00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:34,309
this global community to work

00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:36,369
effectively together to realize that we

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:39,080
need to put everything online and

00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:41,539
transparent and available for the

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,059
community to consume rather than have

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:45,679
these hallway conversations or you know

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,279
in meetings where we're physically

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,700
present

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:52,429
so everything by by default should be

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,700
you know online and conducted online and

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,519
transparent the other thing is holding

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,559
events across the world I love the fact

00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:03,710
that Africa has an open-source event

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,720
because you get to celebrate that

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,770
location and the people there but also

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,350
to

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:15,080
Connect and understand different

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:17,360
locations globally so I I mean it's we

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,400
cannot afford to be us-centric we have

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,640
to be global and we have to acknowledge

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,040
that people who participate in our

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
communities are everywhere it's been

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,390
quite interesting I speak at a lot of

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,770
international conferences and you know

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,059
there was a there is one conference

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:38,660
group in Israel do but you know they

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,770
they're like oh we don't care that you

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,360
know they kind of pushed off like yeah

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,290
we don't care that much about having a

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,940
woman whatever it should just be the way

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,710
it is right everybody's equal and you

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,940
know basically all the speakers again

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,850
coming from the top coming field

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,270
leadership band that conference until

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,030
they fixed that problem so it's it's

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,350
kind of like I don't know if the

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,400
conference's I mean I don't know if the

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,990
speakers put their money where their

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,280
mouth is but if you don't have speakers

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,610
you don't have a conference in a sense

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,040
I'm so that's been really healthy I

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,450
think when you look at open source you

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,660
have so many different voices

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,640
you have the strong strong voices out

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,350
there that are saying no you can't do

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,270
this no you can't do this how could you

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,429
do this and I so appreciate those voices

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,860
that just speak up and kind of jolt

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,770
people awake and then you have the very

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,110
sort of more inspirational focused or

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,120
the more action focus and all these

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,220
different voices appeal to different

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,230
people so you know everybody in this

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,750
room you know you all have a different

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,170
voice that you can share right however

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,850
you decide to do it but again it's

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,290
continuing those conversations and just

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,540
saying hey I'm just gonna do it I'm just

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,890
gonna talk about it who cares you know

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:59,720
there's there's different levels of

00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:01,850
giving giving up you know who died yes

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,880
thank you he's trying to figure out the

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,070
right word so you know that's it that's

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,330
amazing um I want I'm gonna skip around

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,090
a little bit because I want to talk

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,950
about implicit bias and so I just want

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,990
to define implicit bias if and anybody

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,870
in the room hasn't heard it before but

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,410
implicit bias is basically an

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:22,500
unconsciously hell set of sociation

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:25,260
about a social group so implicit bias

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,060
can result in the attribution of

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,540
particular qualities to all individuals

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,390
from that group also known as

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,520
stereotyping right maybe their products

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,480
have learned associations as well and

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,260
social conditioning so do you all have

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,330
any advice on overcoming that implicit

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,790
bias or what do you do cuz you know we

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,650
all have it right we all we all feel

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,750
that way we were just talking about this

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,820
we actually we have some really

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,520
fascinating conversations first we got

00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,450
on the stage yeah do you mind if I stay

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:08,070
oh sorry I think when I move I seem to

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:10,050
create I won't move so maybe start with

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:14,430
how we what we were so yes about I think

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:20,640
the the idea that you can overcome and

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:22,920
like eat implicit bias is fundamentally

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,540
kind of you're not gonna achieve that

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,490
it's it's kind of a real it's kind of a

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,920
really freeing thing to acknowledge when

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,330
you know implicit bias is something that

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,770
you will have you will have it in

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,750
multiple different ways it will evolve

00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,990
and change you might get better at

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:39,240
something through some effort or some

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,160
experience but there is always gonna be

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,620
there's always gonna be work to done be

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,630
done here with implicit bias so this

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,050
kind of you're setting yourself up for

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,510
failure when you or like the view that

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,450
failure is bad as well to think that you

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,940
can completely overcome your implicit

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,470
bias the thing that you can do is know

00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,730
what those things are and challenge

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,320
yourself have conversations with

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,480
yourself in a really compassionate way

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,760
like I thought that why did I think that

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,380
I used that word and I've heard other

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,880
people not wanting to use that word

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,620
winner one of the things that I still

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,650
really struggle to remove from my

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,570
vocabulary at ablest terms like crazy um

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,950
you know when you know that that was so

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,280
crazy or something like that it's

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,720
alright you know I the one that I find

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:26,550
really really jarring it's like I'm so

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,440
OCD about something when actually the

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,170
reality of having something like OCD is

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,530
is incredibly difficult you know it's a

00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,690
huge

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,480
thing but you know when somebody like

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,460
minimizes this experience and uses it as

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,440
a flippant comment the person that you

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,780
might not know how's OCD you using it in

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,660
that way it can be incredibly

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,180
detrimental to the to them so yeah it's

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,730
about challenging yourself but being

00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,900
compassionate not kind of saying I'm an

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,640
awful person because I have this

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,970
implicit bias you're you're a human you

00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,030
know you have that I totally agree

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,340
I mean bias came into being because I

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,400
guess in the primitive days we needed to

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,560
know where danger existed that if it was

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,740
a lion you run away from it and if it's

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,890
a snake you know you kind of avoid it

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,470
and then we started kind of using that

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,690
broadly right and it's a good shortcut

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:22,110
because it helps us bucket things and

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,450
come to easy conclusions and do some

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,510
pattern recognition and handle those

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:31,470
patterns in a certain way but when it

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,280
comes to using it around people it

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,840
causes all kinds of unwanted

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:40,830
consequences and really terrible

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,220
behaviors so I totally agree you cannot

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:46,320
get rid of it all of us have it it's how

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,230
we were brought up the conditioning the

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,070
lifestyle what our parents told us maybe

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:56,340
our experiences for example I when I was

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:59,100
very little I a dog chased me down and

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,320
you know was almost bite you know going

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,710
to bite me and so I've always been

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,950
afraid of dogs so I have been trying to

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,570
kind of get get to know more different

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,850
kinds of dogs and I've had some very

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,220
positive experiences with dogs which has

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:17,880
changed my mind to the point where we

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,610
had a number of dogs at home so my point

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,060
in all this is saying I think we need to

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:26,070
be kind to herself as you said area and

00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,310
to acknowledge that we do have biases

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,560
but be conscious of those biases and not

00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,930
let those biases color the way we

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,410
interact with people and the way we

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:41,070
judge people the way we work with people

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,540
and frankly by following different kinds

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,710
of people whether in LinkedIn or Twitter

00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,720
or meeting different kinds of

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,759
well it was a talk yesterday I want to

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,039
meet ten of you know ten black people in

00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,539
a conference but but by meeting

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:57,279
different kinds of people is how you

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:59,799
form knowledge of people versus just you

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,249
know stereotyping and categorizing yeah

00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:05,649
I think there's always a fear of the

00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:07,690
unknown isn't there as well and once you

00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:11,379
make that unknown and known it becomes

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,330
slightly less scary so I do I do one of

00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:15,249
the talks that I take various different

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,259
places about diversity and design

00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:19,090
specifically but really it's just an

00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:20,559
opener for people to ask me all the kind

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,419
of awkward questions they've ever wanted

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,450
to ask a person that identifies as trans

00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,529
or non-binary LGBTQ as a carer all the

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,590
different things that I list out at the

00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:32,470
beginning I invite them to go to ask me

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,720
either publicly at the end or afterwards

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,879
like ask me these questions because I've

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,769
had them all before and I'm in a space

00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:40,690
now where I'm happy to have those

00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,129
questions and answer them in a

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,559
compassionate way you don't need to be

00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:49,149
afraid this is this is how how things

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,499
grow and yeah you know it's there's also

00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,470
something really important around

00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:55,419
implicit bias that you will sometimes

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,730
have it towards yourself you know I used

00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:59,730
to think when I was very new in my

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,590
transition my gender transition I

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,169
there's a thing with in the the like

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:09,070
trans and non-binary community of like

00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:10,869
passing so you know you passes perceived

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,279
as one gender or the other and there was

00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:14,590
kind of also something about you know

00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,049
you have to look somewhere in between so

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,059
I used to you know perform a certain

00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,119
thing you know I used to perform a

00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:24,009
certain gender whether that was multiple

00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,049
in between all these kind of different

00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,179
things and I very quickly realized that

00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,039
there's no right way to be a woman

00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,450
there's no right way to be a man there's

00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,669
no right way to be a non-binary or a

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,799
trans person if you are that then you

00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:37,570
are that and that's how how you identify

00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,759
but yeah asking asking those questions

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,879
in spaces there will be spaces where you

00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:46,289
can ask those questions I invite anybody

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:49,090
that's ever wanted to ask a trans person

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:51,669
hello or a non-primary person any

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,070
questions you find me at the end and ask

00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:57,340
that question that's how you're good to

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,899
know people yeah I think we see it in

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,230
the workplace where

00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:05,649
Oh junior developers are really good at

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,850
writing really fast CSS all right junior

00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:11,350
developer CSS and writing test or senior

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,869
developer while all our senior

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,580
developers you know again kind of

00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:17,859
implicitly right maybe you're not

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,899
consciously thinking about it but all

00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,299
look like one person and because there's

00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:24,970
a lot of you know let's say white male

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,549
specifically in the u.s. that are senior

00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,759
developers when you're interview kind of

00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:32,109
go that route in a sense and opening

00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,499
your send I think this is why the

00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:37,600
leadership thing and featuring woman and

00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:40,450
non-binary people and just different

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,669
types of people with an open source are

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,220
so important so that everybody has

00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:47,139
different leaders and different you know

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,369
can can start changing the perception of

00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:56,379
the world as a whole so so cool let's

00:31:51,369 --> 00:32:01,179
see okay one I'm gonna go to the the

00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:06,669
better allies question so what can

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:10,239
people do to be better Ally so I'll

00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:12,989
start with a couple of thoughts I think

00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:15,940
everyone needs allies and allies are

00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:18,070
nothing but people who say hey I'm not

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,559
you but I want to understand you better

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,929
I want to know your world I want to

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,019
support you I want to know what role I

00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:28,929
can play in being your friend making the

00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:29,950
world a better place can we use I don't

00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:33,249
know if we can use these interchangeably

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:36,220
but your dumb position right now reminds

00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:38,350
me a lot of a mentor as well it could be

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,779
a mentor it could you know and and I

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:45,039
think the LGBTQ community has created a

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:49,330
lovely continuum of ally ship right it

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,450
can be someone who just says I'm not you

00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:56,470
but I want to understand you better -

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,330
all the way to I want to support you I

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,249
want to change policy I want to change

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,100
the law I want the world to be a better

00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:05,649
place for you and there's a role you

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,289
know across the continuum in terms of

00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:11,080
how actively or how much you want to be

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,220
an ally and allies can be mentors allies

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,690
can be friends

00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:19,020
can be policy changers or they can be

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:22,270
very vocal about supporting you publicly

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,309
or they can be silent supporters it's

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,370
whatever you feel comfortable about

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:32,289
being as an ally but all of us I think

00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:34,299
need allies and but you know from my

00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:37,990
perspective the the area that I've

00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:41,409
studied a lot is women in tech and how

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:44,500
do you support women in tech and it's

00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:47,080
really there's a fantastic Twitter

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,990
handle called better allies it's very

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,450
easy you can follow that and I think the

00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,490
woman who started it also started a book

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,070
called has written a book called better

00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,260
allies and she has a website and she

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,210
started it because people were saying I

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,090
want to be an ally but I just don't know

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,610
how to be one and especially in this

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,740
very dicey world of you know be too and

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,139
other things people were saying okay to

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:15,070
open the door is it okay to take someone

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:17,169
out to dinner you know when can I be

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,750
friends with someone or have a mentee

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:22,720
who's from another sex or another gender

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,540
you know how do I do that so she kind of

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,909
curated lots of practical tips on how to

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,760
be an ally and she's taking it far

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,889
beyond just you know women and men to

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,379
the entire community how do we become

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,820
better allies to each other so I always

00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:42,460
refer to that as my go-to place yeah

00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,210
let's be a better Ally go to go to

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,770
events that are hosted so a lot of them

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,869
I'm gonna do practical tips I think

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:54,129
having the effort obviously having the

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:57,160
having the drive to to to seek that

00:34:54,129 --> 00:35:00,130
insight is the first step but some

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,480
practical things and maybe usually

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,830
there's always different kinds of

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,390
meetups that happen in many many

00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,400
different places if you're more remote

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,740
then you're gonna struggle but there are

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,230
online things now that you can do id24

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,859
is an amazing online conference about

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:17,490
inclusivity it's fully remote and it

00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,990
runs for 24 hours and it's fantastic

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,490
online conference about lots of

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,830
different things so there are ways to to

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,440
involve yourself in other kinds of

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,850
groups

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,740
that don't have to be physically going

00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,860
to things but I always recommend people

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:35,250
go to a group so if you've even got like

00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,960
an LGBT in tech group if they are always

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,420
maybe there are meetups are kind of

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,010
close for most of the year most of those

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,960
groups will have like one meeting out of

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,950
every year well they they'll invite LA I

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,990
like these where people that don't

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,360
identify that way to ask the questions

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,160
I've often so I run a I run several

00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,720
different kinds of groups back home one

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,430
of them is like a women and gender

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,910
non-conforming people in tech one of

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:59,040
them was LGBT you in tech and I would

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,870
always prefer somebody message the group

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,180
and say hey I'm really curious about did

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,280
order for me to then go oh yeah that's

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,270
fine but at this time or at this space

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,130
that kind of thing read reading read

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,470
widely and from people that do not look

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,710
like you and do not operate like you

00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,300
reading is a superpower

00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,520
screen readers are also excellent and

00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:24,570
Braille make it available in Braille and

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:28,350
screen reader friendly so yeah read and

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,730
educate and ask ask questions so it's

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:34,200
kind of again going back to the same

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:36,300
thing most people when they do something

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,580
like open a door or ask a question would

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,760
you like a door open for you regardless

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,530
of how you're perceived it's people are

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,260
getting better at voicing their needs

00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,750
and saying actually I'd prefer it if you

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,760
didn't open doors for me for whatever

00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,650
reasons those may be or no reasons that

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,510
you can give but knowing that that isn't

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,540
like an attack like you did something

00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,610
that somebody didn't need or one they

00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,800
can respond to you back and say actually

00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:07,260
that's not necessary and there's no yeah

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,990
there's no attack in that yes that's

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,340
useful information for you and it's not

00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,140
to take that as oh no I did something

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,730
wrong it's it's to take it as the useful

00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,950
information that it that it is and know

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,500
that most people will be giving you

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,550
information in a compassionate manner so

00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,020
yeah that's how to practical tips about

00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,430
boosting a line I always find it quite

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,040
interesting so we have a mentor program

00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,770
at this thought where apprentice program

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,560
and an apprentice so we focus on women

00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:38,020
in tech and apprentice is a junior

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,660
female developer is paired with

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:45,280
mentors right senior developers within

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,930
our teams and we had one senior

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,030
developer who we assigned as a mentor

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,040
and it was quite interesting to me

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,349
because the junior developer was

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,830
actually teaching the person that was

00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:59,230
supposed to be her mentor to say no you

00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:00,849
know don't just accept my freaking pull

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,720
request because you don't want to hurt

00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,270
my feelings

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,220
give me feedback you know so she

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:10,510
actually became the teacher in that

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:12,460
situation more so than not and I've been

00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:15,339
a teacher and I'm sure both of you have

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,320
also been teachers in situations when

00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:19,119
you know people are trying to help and

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,369
don't really know how to help and I

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,700
think just like you were saying or you

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:27,280
know the the people who you are trying

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:30,520
to be Alice for will be educating you

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,589
also understand that you know if

00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,470
somebody does get upset with you it's

00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:38,230
not it's probably the what do they call

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:44,109
it the thing that tipped the thing over

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:45,430
the straw that broke thank you I'm

00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,380
really good at these things I'm the

00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,750
straw that broke the camel's back right

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,400
so you know if you have an over

00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,349
emotional reaction to something that

00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,030
you're like whoa whoa whoa whoa I

00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:57,400
literally just open the door for you

00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,680
like what is going on know that you know

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,599
it might not be just because of that

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,180
situation it might be like the ten or

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,050
fifteen other times it happened that is

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,390
causing that

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,760
so being sensitive to that as well you

00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,320
bring up a really good point which is

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,050
there's a lot of reverse mentoring happy

00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,599
days absolutely mentees are teaching

00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,160
mentors you know all about their world

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:24,790
and how they function and especially as

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,970
you know our employees new employees

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,040
come into the company I for one want to

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,099
understand their needs and understand

00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,260
how they think and and help you know

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,599
support and lead them yeah but it's the

00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,790
you know also understanding I think as

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,190
you're stepping into that desire to

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:45,070
become an ally desire to help you know

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,910
change the ratio and tech understanding

00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,100
that you know some people have the

00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,470
energy

00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,520
for the emotional labor is that teaching

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:58,250
somebody else take on some days and some

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,620
people don't like I always erican

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,480
Stanley and I uh who else aqui noted we

00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,420
were on some panel I don't remember

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,040
we're on diversity inclusion and she and

00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,990
I said you know we all have our side

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,810
projects yes we all have this one or two

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,760
feet like I will call this one person

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,800
out all the time and I will have strong

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,090
Twitter dams with him but sometimes you

00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,310
know if I'm treated badly at a

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,050
conference because I'm a woman in tech I

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,810
don't even have the emotional energy to

00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,550
tell them why I'm dropping out yeah you

00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,590
know so so know that as well you know

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,970
and and find also you know for those

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,700
people who are trying to do this Ally's

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:34,070
to find allies that you can have and you

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,410
know hopefully we all can learn from

00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,270
each other that way one of the if you

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:42,350
read nothing else after this talk the

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:45,290
emotional labor master post no I don't

00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,930
know that so I think it was from the

00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:50,240
captain awkward forums okay so captain

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,770
awkward is an amazing website I highly

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,900
recommend it it's a series of different

00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,150
questions that you send in problems it's

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,290
kind of like an advice column but there

00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,780
were there is multiple different

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,920
questions but if you google or search on

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,810
the search thinking of your choice

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:11,390
emotional labor master post there was a

00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:12,560
huge forum like discussion that happened

00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,170
from multiple different perspectives

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,400
about the role of emotional labor it's a

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:21,140
it's a big read but it's all individuals

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,470
forum comments and posts about emotional

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,150
labor it's that absolutely fantastic

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,500
downloadable free PDF about different

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,570
perspectives around emotional labor it's

00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,450
fantastic oh thank you for that

00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,220
recommendation or labor and master post

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,320
it is a lot of emotional labor it's very

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,760
it's very heavily underestimated I mean

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,040
I remember we were having some issues

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,160
with two different core Tunes I'm

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,530
associated with and you know I was one

00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,870
of two women on those core teams and our

00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,630
entire weekend was just ruined because

00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:53,030
who did they look to us that was so

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,040
stressful you know so it's not hard you

00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,920
know it and you know for those trying to

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,140
help it's not yeah I'm I think this is

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,360
where allies can really really help yeah

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,720
take the emotional labor off of the

00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,390
people

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,670
that are affected yeah and and take the

00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,010
battle on you know not just like oh

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,230
you're you're the type of person you're

00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,400
that you look like that person yeah you

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,589
help you know be the defender of not

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,780
having to have that person take on that

00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:23,390
emotional labor by themselves yeah I'm

00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,520
doing the so I think it would be naive

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,490
to say that there isn't still gendered

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,829
work so we do still categorize certain

00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,790
things a certain gendered work you know

00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:40,190
you could add mint a sticky note taking

00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:42,440
organizing the party yeah yeah yeah the

00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,630
more that you can understand the

00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,390
categories of gendered work and try and

00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:50,540
like push against those it's it's very

00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,849
meaningful don't really underestimate

00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,609
how meaningful it is to take on that

00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:57,730
kind of traditionally gendered work I

00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:00,950
mean yeah the amount of times that I've

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:02,810
decorated officers for Christmas I was

00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,810
at a start-up and decorated the office

00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:09,079
for Christmas and just like baked cakes

00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,000
weird I don't know why or how everyone

00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,910
in a meeting kind of you to take the

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,440
notes yeah yeah yeah or make things feel

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:21,380
better when they're like not really a

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:25,310
supportive person yeah but there's like

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,500
you know I've always been a teensy

00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,359
little things you can do right for

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,119
example I wear dresses at conferences

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,099
because I just do but a lot of women

00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,780
look at that and you know I remember you

00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:37,400
know one of my friends she's been

00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,190
speaking for 20 years at conferences

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,140
like I'm wearing a dress today this is

00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,270
the first time I've ever worn a dress in

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,400
20 years because I felt like you told me

00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,260
you could do so but I think same thing

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,609
like using pronouns and saying hey you

00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,319
know what I'm gonna use a pronoun you

00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,990
don't know who else is in that room

00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:56,450
that's gonna be so thankful and you're

00:43:53,990 --> 00:44:00,109
gonna change their life by just making

00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:02,690
that small small small little effort it

00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:05,290
really makes a huge huge huge difference

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:09,980
so don't underestimate those things um

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:14,089
the last question I want to ask is for

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,890
underrepresented minorities what can a

00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:18,410
'no for those who aren't

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:24,400
leaders within the organization what can

00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:26,510
they do to help move things forward hmm

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,549
you know I think a lot of people don't

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,990
feel like they have a voice birthday or

00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:33,559
they don't know how to approach it how

00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:37,819
did they make differences I think all of

00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:41,539
us started somewhere and I for me

00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:43,970
personally joining an ERG really helps

00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:47,599
with an employee resource group or a

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:50,299
group of like-minded people who have the

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,069
same challenges or have the same life

00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:57,950
experiences as me that kind of helps me

00:44:54,069 --> 00:45:00,380
normalize validate that you know what

00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,200
I'm experiencing is not alone

00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,059
and then there's power in numbers you

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,799
were just talking about the fact that

00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:09,470
you don't have to solve all of these

00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:12,319
problems yeah it's just nice to be able

00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:16,069
to share it with somebody and say hey

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,109
did this happen to you or you know I am

00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:20,299
feeling crummy today because you know

00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:22,519
this happened to me but just having that

00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:25,400
support group to me has been fantastic

00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:27,470
and then from there to what you said JC

00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,980
you know expressing your voice on

00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:34,039
Twitter Twitter's powerful and then you

00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,720
kind of see others you know expressing

00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,089
the same voice it's it's more of an

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,309
online support group I guess of course

00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:43,549
you will also invite a lot of people who

00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:45,079
will come and attack you and but then

00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:48,650
that says that you're touching a nerve

00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,859
somewhere yeah right speaking up you

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:56,140
know be an ally to somebody else read

00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:58,670
all of those things to me help you

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,849
understand what you're going through but

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:06,650
also find the language and the voice and

00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:10,329
group with which to amplify that so to

00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:14,559
the marginalized people in the room rest

00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:19,069
have a rest you do a lot of work already

00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:21,710
you your existence in the space that you

00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:22,580
exist intact and open source wherever

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:27,860
you exist

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:31,130
is is an effort you know it's and not to

00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:35,120
deny yourself rats the appropriate rest

00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:36,620
to pay attention to yourself dining on

00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,610
the emotional labor if you don't want

00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:43,430
yeah it's powerful it's incredibly

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,050
powerful to know and recognize and pay

00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,480
attention to your own needs within this

00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:50,900
space and know that that you are allowed

00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,050
that even saying that again is always

00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,360
really tough to remind people that you

00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,370
deserve that and you're allowed rest a

00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,860
break to choose your battles to choose

00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:03,110
how you interact to choose whether to be

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,350
mentor to mentor to do all of these

00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:09,320
different things you have a choice and

00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:11,690
that's really really important if you

00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,300
have the time the energy the effort to

00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:18,200
do anything more there are so many

00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,210
things that you can do and again I love

00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,280
the Internet in a lot of ways because

00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,220
it's enabled different people with

00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,350
different kinds of intersection Airy

00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,070
sexuality of marginalization connect up

00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,250
with each other

00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,020
I went to a session at one point people

00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,520
wanted to kind of abolish social media

00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,560
they thought it was like an evil thing

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,670
and in a lot of ways it's very

00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,810
problematic but I almost cried when they

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,160
said all let's get rid of Twitter

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:45,740
because I was like well that's where I

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,540
found my family my family my family have

00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,540
very recently actively rejected me

00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,790
because of you know being a kind of

00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:55,840
identity that they don't accept you know

00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:59,500
that's that's a reality but I have a

00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:02,510
family that spans countries that spans

00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,730
experiences that if I didn't have access

00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,080
to access to that now I probably

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,970
wouldn't be here and that's kind of

00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,170
really super scary things to say you

00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,940
know to agree with people but

00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,120
acknowledging it is again really

00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:16,070
important so yeah the power of community

00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,590
is there but also the power of an

00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,540
inclusive community so a lot of what I

00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,430
really struggle with back home trying to

00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,710
be inclusive of many different kind of

00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:29,600
identities and genders there's a real

00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:32,330
there's a real problem in the or a real

00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,700
tricky conversation to be had in women's

00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:37,060
spaces so I've got a lot of non-binary

00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,550
friends who

00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,550
the best and beautiful facial hair and

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,410
want to keep their facial hair and they

00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,540
should be allowed to keep their facial

00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,970
hair were the things that the mark them

00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,990
is a typically a male gender but they're

00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,020
not they're non-binary

00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:55,840
but when they enter these women spaces

00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,940
because they feel safer in women in tech

00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,120
spaces than they do in any other spaces

00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,040
there's like why are you here so the

00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,680
more inclusive that you can make those

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,510
kinds of spaces like that and going to

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,520
those spaces and having conversations

00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,650
with those spaces is really really

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,190
important if you have that ability and

00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,360
sponsor you got money any of you got

00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,880
money in the audience from your

00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,950
company's gift money to these these

00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:27,570
organizations do it just do it

00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:30,610
use it for good there's a lot of people

00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:33,190
something about Twitter I don't remember

00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:36,550
what it was but they said you know Tech

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:40,570
Twitter is what made me realize that it

00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:42,940
was okay to transition all right like

00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:45,250
you you you have these examples from

00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,900
other people and acceptance from other

00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,810
people and you know this isn't so bad

00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,150
yeah I do this one of the one of the I

00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:54,220
saw a run of quite a few LGBT trans

00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,900
focused events and one of the best

00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,150
things that's ever happened to me was I

00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,400
had somebody come to an event that never

00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,900
been able to to present in the way that

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,310
they wanted to present but they felt

00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,230
comfortable that they wanted to their

00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:07,120
whole lives they were able to come to a

00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:09,040
weekend-long hackathon ask the

00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,840
presentation that they wanted to knowing

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,580
that it was a safe space and then they

00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,560
were able now they're they're out in

00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,870
their workplace which is I think the

00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:21,340
best thing that could ever happen at

00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:23,230
that kind of event so yeah don't yeah

00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,770
there's power in creating those spaces

00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:29,170
for people to express there's a about a

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,230
year ago I created something called I

00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:33,400
call it the femme pyre list and

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:36,700
initially it was just a collection of

00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:39,910
random when my women I found or who

00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,310
people who identified as women wherever

00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:45,040
I was so it started off with you know I

00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:47,380
collected 300 names I think almost a

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,760
thousand names are on there now and what

00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,570
was really funniest when I tweeted about

00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,460
it oh my

00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,200
Frandsen tax started following these

00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,270
lists but you know Twitter doesn't allow

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,520
you to just say follow all you need to

00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,380
individually click and some people wrote

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,910
scripts

00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,860
click via get a thousand people that

00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:04,930
they needed to follow but so many times

00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:08,740
and times again I've heard wow this

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:10,300
really changed my perspective on what

00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,800
tech is right because all of a sudden

00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,170
you're listening to all these different

00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,640
voices and you know and then they go

00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,830
back and they you know they filter out

00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,110
the ones that they don't feel like they

00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:21,970
necessarily need to hear etc etc not

00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,070
saying that you know but you know you

00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,300
have a choice of what who you want to

00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,450
hear and who you don't on the internet

00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,550
right so that that's like another thing

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,350
if you go to my twitter handle ladylee

00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,060
it's a list called semper I think I've

00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,080
pinned it but that's a really good way

00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:39,820
if you want to just get again

00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:41,170
perspective of you know not just the you

00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,360
know typical thought leaders I think

00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,330
that we we have a lot of things I think

00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,970
it's really a good suggestion to follow

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:52,060
people from all walks of life right yeah

00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,950
so you can be more informed of different

00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:58,000
perspectives and then you get me missed

00:51:53,950 --> 00:52:00,730
from the entire world and that's the

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,970
vast like I've followed so many African

00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,680
developers and seen like these just I

00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,710
mean I've I've gotten lost on the

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,890
internet so many times holding me on

00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,300

00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:15,280
