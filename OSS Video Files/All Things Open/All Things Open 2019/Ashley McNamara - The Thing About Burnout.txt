Title: Ashley McNamara - The Thing About Burnout
Publication date: 2019-11-05
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Burnout has been a hot topic in both the open source community and broader tech industry, but too often these discussions simply acknowledge that burnout exists. We can do better. The care and feeding of ourselves is a start, but how about the care and feeding of our community?

Together we will talk about the symptoms of burnout, setting boundaries within toxic work cultures, and the importance of self-care.

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,990
next up I'm very excited about this a

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,300
friend of everyone in this room Ashley

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,410
McNamara who likes Ashley McNamara yeah

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,300
we all do don't we

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,670
okay so Ashley's gonna cut she said

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,369
developer advocate that Microsoft really

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,050
focused on cloud native and go and is

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,119
going to be talking to us this morning

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,260
about something that's so important not

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,540
just everyone in this room but to

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,950
everyone who lives on this planet do you

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,219
think we talk about burnout big round of

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,219
applause please

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:44,520
okay so I am Ashley and I am NOT a

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,100
doctor first I want to say that I am NOT

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,410
here to give you medical advice I am

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,390
here because I am an overachiever like

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,520
many of you in this room which means

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,829
that we are right for burnout

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,079
I've seen many of my friends and

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,059
colleagues burn out and I don't think

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,409
that we take mental health seriously in

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,939
this country so let's get into it

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:10,170
raise your hand if you have been burnt

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:13,979
out so many of you this industry is

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,650
trying to kill us so it turns out you're

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,659
not alone Gallup did a study of 7,500

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,750
full-time employees turns out that

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,549
two-thirds of them burnout that is

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,380
significant it's kind of unacceptable

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,329
out of the people that burn out many of

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,390
them will leave entire industries and I

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,270
know this because I was a photographer I

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,030
ran a photography and web consulting

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,430
business for about ten years at some

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,700
point during the prosumer camera age

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,130
everyone was a photographer driving down

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,310
prices making me work twice as hard for

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,500
the same amount of money so I wrote a

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,899
blog post saying that photographers were

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,530
going to be replaced by robots and I was

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,960
gonna go build robots I am NOT billion

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,149
robots but I haven't picked up a camera

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,250
since I do not miss photography but why

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,730
are we like this why do we continue to

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,130
burn out I have a theory like stick with

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,670
me

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:20,260
back in the day our car or house like

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:24,710
maybe a nice watch was a status symbol

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,330
now it's being busy when we ask somebody

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,630
how they are they're usually like that

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,850
so tired or like I'm really busy if you

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,830
were to be like super relaxed

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:40,760
everything's great we would think you're

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:43,130
crazy or not important many of you know

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,300
me from Twitter it's one of my favorite

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,010
places this is how we communicate now we

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,710
don't call people that's weird

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,740
but on social media like we have a

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,920
curated content right so we're putting

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,490
our best foot forward and we're all

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,530
trying to compete with each other so

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:11,150
kind of sucks but also every leg is like

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:15,500
one serotonin so like we become addicted

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:19,400
to it on top of that we're now

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,140
constantly available i phantom buzzing

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,900
in my back pocket I don't even have

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,460
pockets right now so like no wonder

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:31,370
we're all anxious all the time so I love

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,580
being remote but I hate that there's

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:40,760
often no separation between life and

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:42,950
work on top of all of that we have hero

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,380
and startup culture startups promise you

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,590
if you work your ass off you're going to

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,290
get rich you won't have to work as hard

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,060
not true oftentimes the only people that

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,070
are getting rich of a startup are the

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,340
founders but we are killing ourselves to

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,800
make them rich hero culture people are

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,920
too busy saving the day they're not

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,920
sharing knowledge it sucks

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,820
how long do you think it takes to even

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,310
recover from burnout

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:18,549
I learned this recently it's going to

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:22,030
shock you six months a year two years

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:24,040
two years to recover from burnout

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,430
experts say that

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,980
so like PTSD that even when you leave in

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,220
industry or like even when you move a

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,830
job I mean that there are triggers that

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,830
will trigger you back into that burnout

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,980
cycle so something that you saw at this

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,610
job it's now occurring over here it's

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,310
going to trigger you which is why when

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,860
you feel burnt out taking your vacation

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,350
is not enough if you are recovered after

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,790
a two-week vacation you are not burnt

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,920
out so I think that there are a couple

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,570
of phases of burnout and I'm hoping that

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,350
my next slides are so cute that it

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,360
distracts you from how awkward I am so

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,220
first there's a honeymoon phase and I'm

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,800
an overachiever which means I say yes to

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,800
everything because I don't know what my

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,240
own capacity is I'm really good at

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,550
spotting it and other people that I'm

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,680
terrible at spotting it myself so I'm

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:26,290
like yes I can't wait to get my hands

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:30,100
dirty I figured that I've taken on too

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,070
much I'm starting to see the cracks I'm

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,530
not volunteering for as much anymore

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,170
and my boss is like you have this great

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,160
output like what is even happening so

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:47,580
now I'm feeling like not as motivated

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:50,770
but I'm also ruled by guilt so ho and

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,080
2018 I gained 40 pounds because I was

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,970
working so hard that I didn't have time

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,760
to cook and I don't like to cook so I

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,950
was ordering everything so every meal

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:06,040
was order sustaining on caso case it was

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:10,060
delicious but it's not a food group so

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,090
I've kids I work at home like I said

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,660
there's no separation when I'm at work

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,550
once I'm kind of on this road to burnout

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,150
like everyone's incompetent this job

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,000
sucks

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,880
no you're just not patient anymore when

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,280
I'm at home I'm not engaged my son's

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,930
like mom I'm like I need help with my

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,120
homework or like I want a snack yeah

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,450
figured out kid I'm working this is all

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,450
for you

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,660
so now I'm kind of like kind of deep and

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,200
burn out to the point where like why

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,790
does it

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,230
why doesn't even but like I don't need

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,220
to go to working like who cares it

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,800
doesn't matter anymore

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,870
nothing matters so the only thing that

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,230
my brain can tolerate at this point is

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,210
cat photos maybe some junk food junk

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,190
food is kind of the only control I have

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,190
left now so I'm just gonna keep going

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,350
now I'm here right because they're

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,510
paying me so I guess I better do

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,230
something but I'm not excited about it

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,340
anymore

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm also sustaining on caffeine which is

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,960
not great and then we start to see the

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,510
physical symptoms many people when they

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,210
are burnt out they are misdiagnosed with

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,100
depression so we're not getting to the

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,620
root cause we're covering it up with

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,370
pills it also turns out that there are

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:39,150
many physical symptoms also in 2018 I

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,050
had surgery for diverticulitis I learned

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,150
recently that digestive issues are

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:49,650
common in people that burnout I was two

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:52,020
feet of intestine that year for what so

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,590
here I am now I told a burnout nothing

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,880
matters anymore

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,690
I'm probably searching for another

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,960
another job and that's my ghost totally

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,450
gonna haunt my boss he did this to me

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,950
and the next slide I didn't really know

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,070
where to put this but I thought it was a

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,300
great visualization so I saw this on

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,700
Twitter

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,490
Johnny Holloman posted it he said you

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,470
can see kind of where I burnt out so

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,300
burnout takes a long time it's not just

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,830
like a month of hard work it's like

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,580
years of hard work so you can see in

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:30,900
2016 he's killing it 17 he's killing it

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:35,040
18 is kind of need a break and then 2019

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:38,550
he he's done like he can't he cannot

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,270
focus anymore so I just thought that was

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,850
cool so now we're gonna get to avoiding

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,910
burnout so we all have some personal

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:51,350
responsibility in this right

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,780
but it's hard so first of all getting

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,310
clarity in your job 60% of people don't

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,650
even know what the hell they're supposed

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,050
to be doing so we kill ourselves trying

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,360
to figure it out because we're at work

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,690
for a reason right we're not it's not

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,020
fun

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:11,450
so multitasking some of you think you're

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,310
great at it you're not we can't focus on

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,530
two things at once we can only do one

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,210
thing at a time if you are overloaded

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,250
with work and your manager comes to you

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,160
and says I need you to do this one more

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,920
thing say what do you want me to drop in

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:33,560
order to take this other thing on don't

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:39,890
keep taking on projects like cool set

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:41,320
boundaries so know what you're willing

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,290
to do and what you're not willing to do

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,210
be firm about it it's okay to say no the

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,400
people that work for you or the people

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,040
that you work for are going to continue

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,080
to ask you to do stuff they are waiting

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,390
for you to say no it's okay to say no

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,070
take control like delete these apps from

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,960
your phone like you don't even need them

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,700
unless you're on call there's not a

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,790
single thing that cannot wait until

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:12,710
tomorrow it is not that important crying

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,230
out loud you guys please get a hobby if

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:22,490
your entire identity is wrapped up in

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:25,250
work you're going to burn out get enough

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,850
sleep if you work from home don't work

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,540
from bed your body needs a place to rest

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,760
if you are working from bed then you're

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,830
not going to get the proper sleep that

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,330
you need so the next step I added late

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,970
tips for managers I manage a team of

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:48,770
engineers and I firmly believe that

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:51,650
burnout stems from poor management so I

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,400
added these next slides so any of you

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,830
that manage please write it down be

00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,839
clear about expectations like I said the

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,649
people that work for you want to know

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,430
what

00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:06,920
need to do they they want to get their

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,809
bonuses so they will kill themselves

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,410
trying to figure it out if you do not

00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:19,189
tell them help them understand their

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:22,040
value we want to do well enforce

00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:25,910
reasonable work hours so some of us are

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,769
not 9 to 5 but pick 8 hours make sure

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,959
that your reports are sticking to those

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:33,740
8 hours we don't

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,449
if you cannot finish it in that day in a

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,860
reasonable amount of time it's too big a

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:42,559
task you need to bring other people in

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:46,519
to do it if you are a manager please do

00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:49,029
not contact your people after 5:00 they

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,170
will feel obligated to respond to you

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,999
even if you tell them that they don't

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:58,009
have to encourage people to take their

00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,600
vacation time there are many people that

00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,129
work for me that don't want to take

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,660
their vacation time because they feel

00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,709
like when they come back they will have

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,899
too much work to do

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,089
so I work really hard to make sure that

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,309
they are covered while they are out so

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,839
that they can do that because even if

00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:16,279
you feel like you don't need your

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:19,910
vacation you need your vacation regular

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,639
one-on-ones your one-on-ones are not for

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,279
you the one-on-ones are for the people

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:30,740
that report to you actively listen do

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,740
they sound stressed help them and I

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,620
think that this one is the biggest one

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,870
so hero culture comes from us only

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,899
recognizing the big things that people

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:46,189
do and day to day we're doing a bunch of

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:48,439
little things that that add up so help

00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:49,519
them recognize what's important through

00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:54,879
the small stuff too

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:59,449
and lastly remember why you're even

00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,549
doing this so if you're burnt out the

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,119
people at home are suffering too you're

00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:06,319
not present

00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:12,079
like I said remember why you're doing

00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:13,740
this and I'm done I did it on time

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,940
follow me

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,030
I'm Claire thank you

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,520
[Applause]

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:24,580
