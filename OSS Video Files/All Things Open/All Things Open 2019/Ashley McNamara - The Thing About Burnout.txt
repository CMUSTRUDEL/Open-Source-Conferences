Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Burnout has been a hot topic in both the open source community and broader tech industry, but too often these discussions simply acknowledge that burnout exists. We can do better. The care and feeding of ourselves is a start, but how about the care and feeding of our community?

Together we will talk about the symptoms of burnout, setting boundaries within toxic work cultures, and the importance of self-care.
