Title: Kohsuke Kawaguchi - My Personal Journey Around Diversity
Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Today, in the software development industry, the issue of gender, racial, and other diversities is widely accepted. But I also think this is still largely understood as “social value,” as opposed to “business value.” As a result, the awareness is not leading to enough actions, because it loses out in the crucial fight over priority. Like all other good things, it never get acted on. This is a story of my personal experience that helped me develop new perspectives on this issue, to more clearly see why it’s in your business interest to tackle this.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,690
alright so next up we're gonna have

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,840
caustic car gucci who is a bit of a

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,789
legend in the open source world because

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,910
Gorsky created Jenkins which really

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,199
revolutionized automation in software

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,300
engineering and cozy is also the the CTO

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,730
of cloudBees which is a company that

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,930
provides Jenkins services and course

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,210
he's gonna come and talk about his

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,110
personal journey in diversity and

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:45,390
inclusion big round of applause yeah

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,550
okay so how everyone I'm coast Kay so I

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,930
wanted to talk about the diversity but

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,000
this talk is a little different from the

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,640
usual diversity talk you know we're

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,680
usually the people who experience that

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,360
diversity Huddle's and so on talking

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,219
about their experiences and I'm not

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,800
really a minority in the tech community

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,519
in any stretch of organizations I'm

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,290
Asian I'm from California and you know I

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,280
always felt like a part of the majority

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,740
not unless you know the in this space

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,650
and industry and so I where I came from

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,020
originally its Japan I also felt like

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm a part of the cause in the movement

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,610
right I know the diversity is I think

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,460
nowadays know recognized as a good thing

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,979
and I don't think many people would say

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,110
oh I'm actively against the idea of

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,799
diversity like I know you don't find

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,380
people like that right and I also have a

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,659
little bit of experience what it feels

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,070
like to be on the minority side one of

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,200
my hobby is to do a needlework

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,869
cross-stitching how many of you do that

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,299
I probably not many cause he came at

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,229
this one is generally associated with

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,960
old women in a Cernik know people like

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,909
me don't need it belong there so at one

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,829
point I went to a store outside the Bay

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,020
Area and then there was a group of

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,219
people enjoying the conversation and

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,140
cross the tea together

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,030
I wanted to blend in you know I tried a

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,950
little bit they are nice and all that

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,289
but I didn't feel like I was welcome at

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,180
the place and I never went back so that

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,260
gave me so like a something to think

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,660
about

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,710
in this project I created Jenkins I

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,099
really believe in this idea that

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,170
[Music]

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,390
innovation happened everywhere right so

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,489
Jenkins comes with this extensive plugin

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,590
the echo system where anybody in the

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,150
world can add stuff on top of it and

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,209
make the whole thing more valuable and

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,099
then I did he benefitted from people

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,410
from different industry people who deal

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,090
with the different technology they bring

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,980
different perspectives and what they

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,200
needed on top of this platform that made

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,840
it so much feature so that was also very

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,030
very important for me so once again all

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,510
of that is to say I felt like I was a

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,690
fan of the movement support or the cause

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,209
etc but something happened that so that

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,810
made me kind of wonder if that to be the

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,019
case

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,760
so at work of Kirby's one of my

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,370
responsibilities is to run the community

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,319
team so I brought in Tracy Miranda who

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,440
is in this picture some of you might

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,750
know her she's a very famous in the

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,150
clips foundations and she advocated for

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,190
the diversity in that now that's not the

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,950
reason I brought her over to the clevis

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,200
but a lot of this I was at the strategy

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,790
meeting we started the planning session

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,470
for the community team we are talking

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,440
about what we going to do in the next

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,630
quarter of the year as a key effort you

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,880
know he quite unsurprisingly she brought

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,069
up the idea that well we should like I

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,060
really push hard on the diversity that's

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,100
going to be a good thing for the

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,709
community but one was even what

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,329
surprising is that I find myself

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,310
unconvinced I have lots of other ideas

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,010
and I want to improve the documentation

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,420
I wanted to it that I interviewed a

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,850
whole bunch of the first time talking

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,130
contributors in the duties of that in

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,829
something else all of these things are

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,560
good for the community to work on and I

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,549
wanted those to be done not the

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,040
diversity inclusion effort so what got

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,130
me wondering like the way I think about

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,139
it is you're just being fond of tea

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,510
that's a diversity is not enough well I

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,069
mean that's not the bar right that's

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,120
that's obvious a good idea what's really

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:22,620
a bar is soak up the bottle of a

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,720
priority like do you can you like DDC

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,500
important investor becomes top of the

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,170
pile

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,730
or is he just like is it like all the

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,860
other good things that never gets done

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,170
right so in this case what I find is

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,350
like at least for me that context like I

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,030
find myself unable to select an able to

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,480
pick the diversity at the top of the

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,490
queue

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,800
so in fact I wasn't defined in the

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,600
movement I was part of the inertia I was

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,980
a part of the system that makes it

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
difficult for people who are the brigade

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,310
and for passionate about it they move it

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,680
forward now so the real question is not

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,140
whether it's good or bad it's the real

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,790
question is how valuable it is for the

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,850
business to be able to take it you know

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,280
to be able to justify that in order to

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,350
be d dragon just because the diversity

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,480
is a good social Bobby doesn't mean like

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,220
you can take that on as a business right

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,540
you have to you have to hit your goals

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,140
you have to make it money and all that

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,060
stuff so that those tech questions like

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,990
thousand comfortable realization for me

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:25,790
so I studied any going down a bit of a

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:30,630
soul-searching right away I saw it

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:33,600
either like I find a way to justify that

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,700
and then in that process be able to

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,800
convince people in the team and my boss

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,140
is that my boss said well this is a

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,540
worthy thing that aligned well with my

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,340
cause or like I have to admit it to

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,380
myself that I'm not really a fan of the

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,540
movement okay yeah I guessed it all

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,460
activity opposite but it's not important

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,200
enough for me right and then that might

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,530
be that that's something I happy I'd

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,210
have to come to terms with so I started

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,820
like I said I started doing a bit of

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,910
soul-searching and then I came up is

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,480
this one story that helped me think

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,770
about this in a little different ways so

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,280
this person Allen Hamilton

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,070
she in this story I saw I heard about

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,500
this in the podcast in this story she's

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,410
a she's trying to start a new venture

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,720
capital form that if you think the tech

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,430
community has a diversity problem the

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,080
venture capitalist committee it surely

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,160
has an even bigger diversity problem

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,200
right so what she was absorbing actually

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,530
is that if you look at those hungers

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,260
that's funded by these VC firms it's a

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,530
it's it's disproportionately young

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:45,540
male and I saw what she thought was well

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:49,180
if she built a new venture telephone and

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,240
focus on investing in what she called

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,300
the minority like no women founder the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,460
black founders or the LGBT founders

00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,220
because she happened to hit all of the

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,840
oldest Reebok sees and these you know

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,110
these groups of people are currently

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,070
under represented in the in the in the

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,470
startup under not just a fact

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,210
statistical fact that she also mixed of

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,430
the vation dead whatever makes the

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,520
startup founders successful like a grid

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,620
of persistence or you know any number of

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,980
these things it's reasonable to assume

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,720
that they come evenly across these gaps

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,480
like just because you're human doesn't

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,910
mean we lack in these talents so she

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,800
from those two observations he kind of

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,410
it she come to reasonable logical

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,600
conclusion that well if you focus on

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,670
these underrepresented people then you

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,400
have a higher chance of coming running

00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,650
into high quality candidates high

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,750
quality the cassava panniers and then

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,440
their fourth her VC firm will be more

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,290
successful right so another great that's

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,260
a great sort of like a that made a lot

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,450
of history as a business and then I

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,610
thought this structure is applicable for

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,770
any number of other things so let's say

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,650
in the dinkus project you know we have a

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,080
lot of contributors from America and

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,960
Europe but I need that there are a lot

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,040
of the software developers in Asia these

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,930
people you don't need to see the

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,310
software developer from AGI anybody of

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,440
the sauce community so they are

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,140
underrepresented so if I focus on these

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,310
audience then I can turn that higher

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,320
quality the more parts more easily

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,480
because nobody else is competing on

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
these resources right so not it's I

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,550
think the same logic applies not just in

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,160
her case but I mean any number any

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,780
number of other stations and then this

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,729
story I'm not really doing a justice to

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,950
the story itself it's amazing story

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,260
where at one point it involves her

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,120
sleeping in the San Francisco Airport we

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,820
try to raise the fund and so on so if

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,160
you get a chance I think it'd be it'd be

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,740
I highly encourage you to hear all the

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,300
story and this is her formulation that I

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,399
thought is

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,320
powerful kind of capture distance of

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,850
Lima time to tell you it see that it

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,220
look like a DVD those are

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,950
underrepresented people but it's really

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,990
just underestimated people I'm sorry if

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,970
you can select a corrector bias of this

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,399
weekís idea then you again you have a

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,500
higher chance of getting a lot more high

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,200
quality people into whatever community

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,600
or the company you're trying to build

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,880
now there's another story that I've

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,940
heard around the same time which is

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,980
called the curb cutting effects so this

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,890
is another this is a scan story that

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,410
happened in the Berkeley era 1970s in

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,380
other that like a walkway to the world

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,450
has a gap freight the car with the curve

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,970
cutting these are generally first with

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,730
building a slope so as you can imagine

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,620
for the wheelchair people the fact that

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,899
there is a gap is a major problem it's a

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,339
major obstacle for their mobility so in

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,920
Berkeley a bunch of the wheelchair

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,540
people kind of came together and they

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,050
complain bitterly to the city government

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,730
they make a slope now what they

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,860
discovered is that once they cut the

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,570
slope it not only benefited the

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,750
wheelchair people but for bunch of other

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,270
people like the people who is pushing

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,100
baby strollers business people is the

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,740
carrying the backpack I mean the

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,310
suitcases or the deliberative or it's

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,610
the cards so what this is about is you

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,040
know when you the people who complain

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,290
the most is the people who are most hard

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,180
but when you've solved the problem you

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,399
actually saw me a little more general

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,040
problem that benefits the long tail of

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,690
the other people and as an engineer I

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,310
think this is also kind of easily

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,320
understandable thing right even somebody

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,870
finally a bug report you don't need a

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,329
fix that bag alone you have kind of

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,760
fixing a whole bunch of bugs that to be

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:40,350
presented by the particular incident so

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,480
we're used to solving the problem in

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,060
more general ways and naturally when you

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,440
solve this kind of like at the

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,260
accessibility problem the same thing

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,970
happens in the transcript the closed

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,199
captioning there's a lot of example we

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,750
are things originally done for the habit

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:01,470
of people with benefit other people you

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,240
know like I usually turn the closed

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,270
captioning all the time in noisy

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,890
environment because

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,800
now I'm not English is not my native

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,360
language and it's a it's an virus it's

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,330
really hard to hear what's going on and

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,640
then in the screen it helps I'm not this

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,420
but this that doesn't exactly the

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,630
example of the longtail benefiting from

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,720
the solving the key problems so when he

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,990
look at things like that I so excited

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,320
seeing things differently right so I

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,000
started math I not think of this as

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,800
something like this so in a building a

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,480
community or building a company building

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,760
any group of people is somewhat like

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,260
opening a new bar in a new town right

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,540
you have some ideas of like how a kind

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,459
of variable around and any create the

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,620
place and some people start showing up

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,500
and then in a year observe how they're

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,750
doing or this pattern will tell you how

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,810
they want your face to be improved

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,450
and so you through that interactions

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,370
like you keep improving your world and

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,550
it kind of grows bigger and getting

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,930
busier and nicer now that's all great

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:10,510
but at some point if we wanted to

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,970
unleash the next stable growth if you

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,730
have to do something else and that

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,950
something else is basically can walk up

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,959
and reach out and see it's walking in

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,300
the street like it's not enough to talk

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,740
to people who are already at your bar at

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,930
some point you need to talk to people

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,850
who are not coming into a bar it was

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,440
that's the majority of people and you

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,420
don't know who they are and where they

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,120
are and what they need so what it takes

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,560
is active active reaching out you know

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,940
you might be allies that well in the

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,279
street there's a lot of Hispanic people

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,140
here and maybe the bar that they often

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,970
only have like a Japanese many so no

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,709
other they can't come in and they can't

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,040
order because they can be the lady

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:51,070
it's a sometimes when you just be chat

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,410
and see see those other people up close

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,300
that's enough to give you the idea what

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,329
mystic done and suddenly it stopped

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,329
being abstract fuzzy concept and became

00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:04,810
a form of concrete and solvable problems

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,820
practical problems and in depth like

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,709
when I look at it like that I could see

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,050
Oh like I was actually tackling this

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,640
kind of problem before as I mentioned a

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,339
little bit about the Japanese community

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,110
so in a being from Japan I know because

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,560
I actually feature all these faces of

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,860
people

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,300
who live over there who had great

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,370
technologists that's currently not being

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,860
a part of this you know the network of

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,249
applesauce people in the America in

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,199
Europe so you know sometimes if you own

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:35,230
your network you know you just know that

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,610
this untapped group of people exist but

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,069
if you're outside you just don't know it

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,779
right so here's the example here I knew

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,170
this community existed and I can be

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,480
reached

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,160
it's a little bit rare for you know with

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,439
like things like a language and timezone

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,019
barrier these are the obstacles but the

00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:52,870
other people doesn't really see that

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,579
those things exist and so when I try to

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,439
advocate for the fact that well that's

00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,459
been it a like a bring this agent about

00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:00,009
Percy into the mix

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,170
they'd go like I don't need it because I

00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:04,149
don't really see these Japanese the

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,040
Roper walking around here and these

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,949
people don't exist is how other people

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,660
feel it so and that was a kind of yeah I

00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,910
had this experience before is another

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,379
thing I thought and I also realize but I

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,620
have experience on the other direction

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:21,790
as well right I mean I knew in the head

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,350
I suppose in theory that they're very

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,449
active software development community in

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,550
China but I've never needed these people

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,800
and then couple of years ago I had my

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,350
first opportunity to visit China and I

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,699
was blown away by the scope and size of

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,860
the software development that's going to

00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:37,269
go and then I was wondering well like

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,790
how come you guys are not joining the

00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,220
project and then like I realize that oh

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,360
on our mailing list or on the Google any

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,040
China there's this thing called the

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,470
Great Firewall and guess what they

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,230
brought Google so they couldn't join our

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,759
mailing list right and then well how did

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,379
it how come you didn't complain because

00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,360
we have a social network and we have

00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:57,579
some like interaction is individual

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,850
users on Twitter and guess what that's

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,769
also doctor over there so sometimes like

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,319
you go there and you talk to people like

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,120
it immediately became obvious like a bar

00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:10,000
they can't really join this community

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,300
like no wonder so that was another

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,610
example that helped me think about it so

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,389
and then yet perhaps another example is

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,819
in your passado

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,470
product for the longest time we think is

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:23,470
project only have software developers

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,420
and so we built the governance and

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,860
secondly the critique structure that

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,800
made it difficult for other job

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,100
functions the joy so the at some point

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,690
when the project

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,730
the first kind of people I needed to

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,410
bring in the marketing people so people

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,410
who run the events and you know they

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,020
organize meetups and and so so they had

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,580
mighty difficult time I mean I used to

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,130
think of them and all these marketing

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,290
people don't know how to engage and work

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,420
in the open-source community and that's

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,430
somewhat true but that's also like only

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,560
a one-sided way in some sense I think

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,180
they are the first like a guinea pigs

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,480
they are the wheelchair people that's

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,240
trying to get into this community and so

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,800
what we have to do well we actually did

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,110
it with only what we don't think in

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,970
distance we mentally did was we built

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,160
the governor's we build most structures

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,840
so that people outside did software

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,730
developing function could feel the

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,610
authenticity and then power to decent

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,710
work and then after this first wave of

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,810
people came through we were able to use

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,820
the same structure for driving more you

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,130
know the documentation people designer

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,160
or sefa structure people in the lofts

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,110
people and so on so forth so again once

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,040
we solve this problem for one class of

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,110
people we were able to make make a whole

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,960
lot easier for the rest of the any other

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:42,590
algorithm functions as well so so these

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,960
are kind of T so like experience and

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:49,160
perspective that helped me kind of get

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,440
to where I am in 2019 and I really think

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,120
of the diversity isn't just about the

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,310
gender or the race or somebody well

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,020
understood class problems not saying

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,730
like these things do not exist but I

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,430
feel like sometimes if you only think

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,930
about these things I think it it makes

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,540
it difficult for you tick and I think

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,910
about what's really important which in

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,949
my mind is this motion of never-ending

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,839
motion the reaching act in each set of

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,030
people and then trying to see with

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
preventing them from being a part of

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,500
your thing and then solving their

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,810
challenges and if you think about it it

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,570
there is nothing particularly like

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,130
social law there's nothing inherently

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,900
social rally it's something that the

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,060
business do all the time right reaching

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,620
a new segment of the market and an

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,270
untapped alertly turned that into

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,030
productive force for the for the

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,830
business so I hopefully like that's

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,560
that's kind of how I start to think

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,480
about it now um and it can be run a

00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,320
little time so I want to end my talk

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,060
here and so thank you very much

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:54,470
[Applause]

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:54,470
