Title: Jocelyn Matthews – I Came Here to Meet 10 Black People: Normalizing my own presence in tech
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Once you’ve “made it” – then what? I like to set a goal at every event I attend, to meet ten black people over the course of the event. People of marginalized and underrepresented groups are frequently enticed into tech by the prospect of security, respect, intellectually challenging work and the prospect of building generational wealth. However, these opportunities frequently come at the cost of splitting the self. It can be stressful as well to balance issues of entitlement against impostor syndrome, to arrive at a healthy level of self-esteem that is reality based. For first-generation people who are suddenly making more money than both parents combined, the situated experience of being the “first” or the “only” to occupy this space causes them to resort to cobbling together ad hoc techniques of coping. I argue that the best strategy is to normalize yourself in the spaces you’re in – whether its a conference, meetup or office. This can take the form of setting goals, understanding class structures, and operating from first principles. While the hiring and work cultures of tech is reflective of society at large – they are also a part of the process of creating that same society. What I mean by that is nothing exists in a vacuum. Companies have problems with diversity because the world we live in has problems with diversity. The hopeful message in all this however — and I hope the real takeaway — is that by changing the spaces and ways in which we work, we have the opportunity to effect powerful change to the society we live in.

Jocelyn Matthews began working in tech during the 1990s. She has been black her whole life and is getting pretty good at it.

[Music]

00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:15,389
hi thank you for having me here it feels

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,949
really good to be in this room before I

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:22,529
start I just wanted to say thank you to

00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:25,680
nickimja it was a beautiful talk and

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,590
it's not easy to go first and I mean

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,449
that on more than one level so thank you

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:40,320
so much it was it was really a beautiful

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:42,510
talk okay so I got the clicker now and I

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,520
came here to meet ten black people is

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,170
the title of my talk so I'm going to

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,700
stand on the shoulders of a giant for a

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,059
moment and just start off with this

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,180
quote from Toni Morrison and just say

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,690
that the very serious function of racism

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:04,260
is distraction it keeps you from doing

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,820
your work it keeps you explaining over

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,650
and over again your reason for being

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,310
somebody says you have no language and

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,670
you spend mmm so you spend 20 years

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,490
proving that you do somebody says your

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,110
head isn't shaped properly cause you

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,740
have scientists working on the fact that

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,170
it is somebody says you have no art so

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,079
you dredge that up somebody says you

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,520
have no kingdoms so you dredge that up

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:38,369
none of this is necessary so I'm going

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,170
to move ahead and just explain why I

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,909
give this talk it changes a little time

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,280
a little bit every time that I get up

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,380
and see who's in the room it kind of

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,049
shifts around a little bit but the

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,500
genesis of this talk is just a really

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,930
small anecdote I went to an event that I

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,060
had a badge for and I was in you know

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,969
invited to be there and every time I

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,520
went to enter the venue I was stopped

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,540
because people didn't believe that I

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,719
belonged there

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,050
and people around me would be going in

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,640
and people their badges weren't being

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,140
checked they weren't being stopped

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,400
nobody was asking

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:21,380
why they were there and it didn't feel

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,450
great and so I said to myself well

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,440
that's their problem because I obviously

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,410
do belong here I have a badge and I'm

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,590
not going to be defined by the ignorance

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,780
and assumptions of people who think that

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,240
they know something about me because

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,200
they're incorrect and more to the point

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,720
not only do I belong here but so do

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,330
other people like me and I'm gonna find

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,640
them so I said to myself you know what

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,959
I'm going to get past this annoying

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,120
person again and I'm going to go in I'm

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,590
gonna find 10 black people this is my

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,810
goal for the week I'm gonna find 10

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:07,550
black people so the question is once

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:13,430
you've made it in tech what happens then

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:18,810
the answer is set a goal 10 black people

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:23,100
why 10 10 is the smallest big number

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,090
right so it seems like you should easily

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,250
be able to find 10 black people and when

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,250
you go to do it many times you find

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:37,440
actually it's kind of a big number and

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,110
and it's also really weird

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,610
so I found it to be a really disarming

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,769
thing that I would just go up to people

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,320
and say like hey how you doing like I'm

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:51,180
here to meet 10 black people and they're

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,860
like wow that's specific and then they'd

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,239
be like yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna help

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,410
you out I'm gonna find it and then they

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,410
look around the room and it's like

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,750
and sometimes what else will happen was

00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,010
that people really get into the project

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,720
and they'll take you by the hand and

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,810
drag you across the room and find 10

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,070
black people so it can play out in a

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,320
variety of ways and that sort of begs

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,660
the question if it's so hard to find 10

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,630
black people like why do I even want to

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:25,400
be here people do ask that why Tek

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:27,590
anyway and I would say that Tek is

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,160
awesome it offers a lot of things

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,680
it offers security it offers prestige it

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,960
offers an intellectual challenge I like

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,430
to solve interesting problems and I

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,870
think that's true of a lot of black

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,090
people and also this is a huge motivator

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,590
for people of color it offers the chance

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:52,930
to build generational wealth and many of

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:57,370
us have come from backgrounds and

00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:00,560
Heritage's where that was withheld and

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,950
we want to pass things down to our

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,710
children we want to pass things up to

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,350
our parents to our grandparents we want

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,890
to help our extended families we want to

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:16,940
build assets and Tech offers a route to

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:20,360
all of those things but once you get

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,490
there it can be rough so what you will

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,450
find if you come from a background in

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,820
which opportunity has been withheld is

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:31,750
what I call it's an experience that I

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,390
call the bends when people are under

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,870
deep-sea pressure and come up too fast

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:42,680
it can it can lead to a physical stress

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,690
and in the same way when you have come

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,210
from a background in which opportunity

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,610
has been withheld and suddenly come up

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,490
and some of that pressure is released

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,520
and you're making more money and you

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,590
have a good job title there's a sense of

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,270
disorientation that can come along with

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,390
that you are suddenly surrounded by

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,590
people who take a certain type of

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:08,900
entitlement for granted they have been

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,270
immersed in it their entire lives they

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,000
don't question it

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,340
because they can't see it and it can

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,140
feel really strange to come into that

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,340
environment you're around people that

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,410
are strangely weird and cold sometimes

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,480
they have certain assumptions and

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,090
practices that you didn't grow up with

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,960
and there's this sense of cognitive

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:36,190
dissonance that comes along with that

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,350
additionally when you are coming into

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,770
the situation and particularly if you're

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,540
self-taught it's easy to feel impostor

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,390
syndrome and I think right now there's a

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,250
fetish for impostor syndrome you see so

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,960
many articles that just assume that you

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,520
have it of course you've got impostor

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,410
syndrome of course you feel like you

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,420
don't belong here and you're always

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,560
gonna feel that way and I think that's

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,720
not true

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,490
I think you do reach a level of

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,200
proficiency where you don't feel like an

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,960
impostor anymore and you do know that

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,540
you earned your place but the people

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520
around you don't think that so there's

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,680
this cognitive dissonance between an

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,560
imposter syndrome that you've shed and

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,580
grown out of but maybe other people

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,770
think you're an impostor so it can be

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,980
really hard to arrive at a sense of

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:27,160
self-esteem that is both healthy and

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,460
reality based the amount of

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,380
code-switching that you need to do to go

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,580
between your roots and then go to your

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:40,780
job at work can it can be very hard to

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,700
navigate those different those different

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,830
spheres while still feeling like you're

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,840
being true to yourself and you don't

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,960
ever want to lose that sense of truth

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,280
you don't ever want to lose that sense

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:57,400
of who you are and ultimately you are

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,890
the single source of truth for who you

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,310
are nobody can tell you and nobody can

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:08,710
put it on you they can try but you know

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:11,680
who you are the situated experience of

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,890
being the first and being the only it

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,520
can be highly stressful as I just said I

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:23,320
am in my third decade of tech so I've

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,230
been doing this a long time and probably

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:32,810
what you're thinking where

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:37,820
now is she looks great it's just kidding

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:40,010
but but it is sometimes very stressful

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,070
to be the first and to be the only and

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,990
then what happens is that you have to

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,750
cobble it together yourself

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,040
come on honey go forward and you're

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,440
forced to resort to these ad hoc

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,760
techniques of coping which is

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,710
inefficient why should you have to

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,070
reinvent the wheel every time but

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:02,540
frequently that's what happens here are

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:06,620
some my techniques love it can be really

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,890
hard to love yourself as you're going

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,540
through this really hard really

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,580
dispiriting really discouraging and if

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,310
you have those moments where you're

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:23,810
having trouble accessing that love for

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:28,670
yourself I love you you don't know me

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:31,790
but I love you and there are there are

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,770
people out there who would understand

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,510
you if they knew you you can try and

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,790
make it your mission to find them and

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,820
frequently they will find you and I'm

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,800
hoping that in this talk if you're

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,930
looking around and you're feeling that

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,060
way and you see that spark in somebody's

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,380
eye make a connection talk to them come

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:54,200
find me afterward nothing exists in a

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,690
vacuum and we hear all this talk all the

00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,110
time about how Tech is special it's not

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:03,380
there's nothing special about tech tech

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,570
is made by people and people when they

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,370
go to their jobs act like who they are

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,990
and they act the way that they act the

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:17,420
rest of the time in this world and when

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,730
you when you are dealing with people you

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,340
need to remember that companies are

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,800
people in the same way that Tech is

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,560
people and the reason that companies

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,120
have a problem with diversity is because

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:35,660
the world has a problem with diversity

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:38,380
and that's actually good news if you

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,820
have professional accountability

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,220
you can ask yourself what are you

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,650
complicit in what are you holding up

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,500
where are your blind spots and what are

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:53,960
you acquiring as you climb this ladder

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:55,970
are you forgetting that access and a

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,320
free ticket are not the same thing as

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,270
nickimja said are you forgetting that

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,460
something as simple as bus fare can

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,020
prevent someone from making it to an

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,020
event like this even though there's no

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,360
charge there are a lot of really small

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:16,010
things that you can do and you can help

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,480
to short each other up and that leads to

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,390
personal accountability because

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,880
companies are people and tech is people

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:28,520
and we are people we're humans with each

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:32,000
other what can you do as a human to and

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,660
for your fellow humans to make the world

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,640
closer to what you think it ought to be

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,990
what can you do to make tech closer to

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,839
what you think it ought to be when you

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,910
change the spaces in which we work you

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,950
actually change the society we live in

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,290
and that's why I said it's good news

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,720
that people act at work the way that

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,650
they do every place else because you

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,420
have the option to bring this in and

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:05,060
everything in society has the ability to

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:10,029
change so leader board time I came here
