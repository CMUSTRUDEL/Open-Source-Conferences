Title: Jono Bacon – Decoding The Human Condition
Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	At the epicenter of what drives open source is a network of thousands of interconnected minds all around the world. These minds are connected to individual projects as well as our broader community. The open source projects that succeed are able to fuse great technology, open workflow, and meaningful, impactful, inclusive communities.

In this new keynote from Jono Bacon, community strategy consultant and author of ‘People Powered: How communities can supercharge your business, brand, and teams’, he will walk through the core human behavioral ingredients that form healthy, productive open source communities. Bacon won’t just present these ingredients, but also guide ATO attendees in how to incorporate these ingredients into their own communities to help generate productive, healthy, open source projects.

[Applause]

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:35,670
so slightly bigger name okay so nice I

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:38,670
saw a completely changed my perspective

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:44,879
on track to live alone and also the

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:47,070
reliability problems in 2019 some decent

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,710
change some things remain largely the

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,140
same all these I'm really excited to see

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,160
that communities across the world become

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,199
an incredibly powerful pause how we work

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,570
for everything how we operate so for

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,359
example body may be aggrieved seven

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,780
chapters all over the world Salesforce

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,090
and sa people over a million uses we

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,100
have sausages is a race through three

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,100
million dollars in prize money money

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,049
they only these later six basic units

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,210
going to be had I generated the leads

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,750
immediately runs around the world and

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,900
here recording community wiki film

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,060
industries and leadership review shared

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,600
production many would be showcased as

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,909
unmask now but accompany server to me

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,549
more powerful this incredible network

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,720
device that will combine experience

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,820
perspective IDs and time are we bring on

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,720
the sense of games getting incredible

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,630
results in all this what this results in

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,360
is essentially hoping in my life Tweety

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,549
people firmly produce the very essence

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,350
the human visually best together we are

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,670
fundamentally social animals

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,979
now it'll all be seen out on emissions

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,939
being a pair of I mean only basis or the

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,939
initial

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,719
[Music]

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:24,510
oK we've seen the more and this is

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:29,250
riffle did also we see there's also a

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:35,239
graphical periphery of this discussion

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,239
the intentional and inclusion of

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,099
Americas and the seasoning but I can

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,900
accent what we might because

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,160
fundamentally is software with nothing

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,630
is professional needs that's a

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,010
reasonable price offered the breakfast

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,010
Peterson the core nervous condition now

00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:00,120
it's all a sudden this this has another

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,980
a massive math years or so and what we

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,650
see is who think that was an accidental

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,250
work every week they haven't ever seen

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:13,310
crane operator now many new study this

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,310
muscle yeah my so finally needs

00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,689
[Music]

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,260
[Music]

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:19,160
I see how difficult my visit now

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,890
I firmly believe that the way to do at

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,820
least hassle easily no the sense of

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,919
belonging here to be probably the most

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,810
incredible protection whether it's an

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,390
open source community whether it's in a

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,880
family of young but it takes the

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,919
journeys yet extracting access that you

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,830
have to be able to contribute so when

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,810
you learn to build a sense of respect if

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,030
you come but you do something in that

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,620
world as you go through that would

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,979
easily erase dignity recess finally nice

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,010
as we build our confidence and illness

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:57,440
of strength dignity it makes gives you

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,510
don't you think bigger a broader robbery

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,450
at not least our Kalani

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,390
as when we had this unseen kind of

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,070
mentoring that flows through society is

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,289
based about much the world what we do

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,840
but also such finality

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,169
when said it will beautiful to adjust

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,810
the way to speak that work so we see a

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,050
number of reasonable design problem not

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,050
quite

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:28,050
social contact - same as years ago now

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,650
the other thing as well is the mission

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:37,470
critical decision to be front operative

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:41,940
it's been weird but I love my lead off

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:44,970
this is computer science of these look

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,470
like bloggers and the in screaming let

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,330
alone the actual Tom Cruise as

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:57,570
illustrated by this guy you might think

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:59,700
Rebecca's so when I was a little boy my

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,830
choppers gonna dirty rocking chair

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,060
finally buy yourself an efference ask if

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,070
it's whatever that price - price said it

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,810
was to build an Android app to teach

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,850
these kids how to read about you a

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:20,120
teacher the mission education

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,120
submission really critically final it

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:28,860
officially cement is an honor code now

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,890
in a great way to put these things

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,880
together but in the course of my career

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:37,770
everyone does something called the

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,350
community participation rate of disease

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,500
isn't happening people do through the

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,050
door smoothly positions you need as

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,760
possible so first of all the descendants

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,710
and they value really really simple and

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,160
we need to manage happines that level of

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,290
purity of an MVP believe I've played

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,320
slowly like to learn all you do them in

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,610
the way they enjoy independence actively

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,700
and externally to this generation

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,610
through satisfying

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,270
families of the recent perfect but then

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,370
what happens

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,440
it wants to generate at least I give

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,550
anything for journey so you start

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,090
actively

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,160
casual member I stay here there and then

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,920
you get into be irregular and if you

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,550
have really caught almost really

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,550
obsessed

00:09:23,149 --> 00:10:24,649
in the information be diseased brain

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,600
[Music]

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,220
now the way to get moving from casual to

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,200
the regulars to the corkscrew series and

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,890
severance human being some being said by

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,710
pretty well as well in violence or dudes

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:32,680
like poppy thoughts Nancy preached at

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:34,690
poppy and they're basically a couple my

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,390
son loved it that things like to say

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,130
let's add a piece together we have to

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,480
see some batteries throw these other

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:50,350
things but also the sense of space

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:56,320
community is maybe is want to see these

00:11:50,350 --> 00:12:02,490
new ways stated and separate cities we

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,410
don't think you do sing yes to example

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,550
in a game you must be they will be

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,510
priced you I think one of the most good

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,140
people

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:19,200
another example here is a sound did you

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,200
beat criteria right the back in class

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,870
but on the submarines money this is

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,810
where we'll do it has created great

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,920
fascination we respond to it the very

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,050
human waste

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,170
nobody's so resembling is

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,119
see conditions where the prostate the

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:47,279
great work that the communities

00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:50,220
highlight as community foundation

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,649
recognition we plug the moment everyone

00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:01,199
this is called scrap we shall welcome

00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:08,069
very effective examples very tightly

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:12,239
smokers and they so in conclusion three

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:15,149
things I'd like everybody talk about

00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:17,279
right here that one is to be intentional

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:21,170
my duty as your software we spend a lot

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,100
of time digging around the base of our

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,100
commuters anymore

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:33,749
secondly to Romanies of the southeast at

00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:35,670
a design firm certainly always challenge

00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:40,199
ourselves don't be so fast

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,949
Justin serviceable dude holding Yankees

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,829
for brats

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:48,240
you're really - probably settle my tab

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:55,889
okay thanks now before I lock up I just

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:58,339
wanna mention one be briefly define our

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:02,779
conversation this makes me walk through

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,779
the body who is quite an interesting

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:20,339
business both of me I saw this book for

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:24,089
the first time in flash back to Mouse

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,699
ago nowhere else to ask basically King

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,249
Pablo's teeth Frank it obviously meant

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,799
and they said that you've got the bottom

00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:34,199
so the firms were pretty easy so many

00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:38,040
witnesses number of copies most uh needs

00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:40,850
to read the nests or down lobbying and

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,850
it's to be

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:53,200
[Applause]

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,200
