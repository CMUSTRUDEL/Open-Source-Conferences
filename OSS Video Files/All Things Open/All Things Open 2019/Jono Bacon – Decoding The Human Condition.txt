Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	At the epicenter of what drives open source is a network of thousands of interconnected minds all around the world. These minds are connected to individual projects as well as our broader community. The open source projects that succeed are able to fuse great technology, open workflow, and meaningful, impactful, inclusive communities.

In this new keynote from Jono Bacon, community strategy consultant and author of ‘People Powered: How communities can supercharge your business, brand, and teams’, he will walk through the core human behavioral ingredients that form healthy, productive open source communities. Bacon won’t just present these ingredients, but also guide ATO attendees in how to incorporate these ingredients into their own communities to help generate productive, healthy, open source projects.
