00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,750
okay hello everybody how you doing you

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,890
so when I first talked to Sara about

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,029
giving this a lightning talk I was like

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,680
what what are we thinking about in terms

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,449
of what do you want me to talk about and

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,640
we came out with this fantastic outline

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,439
there was about an hour of content I

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,880
said the other day I was like well how

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,439
much time do I really have she said

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,829
seven minutes so here we go so basically

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,930
the idea is I'm a professor of design

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,579
technology Parsons school design in New

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,399
York but I'm also a media and Technology

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,280
consultant for the Smithsonian Museum

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,510
National Museum of Natural History and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,500
being part of that museum involved in

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,120
that team a lot of the work we're doing

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,520
is around dinosaurs and one of the

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,079
ongoing conversations is about the

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,690
application of technology within the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,460
museum space like how essential is it

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,129
what are the compelling reasons to

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,980
invest in that direction and it happens

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:06,390
that I'm working at about three projects

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,640
right now with the museum so very often

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,049
thinking about so like the entree of

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,939
Technology and narrative sort of

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,920
platforms into the museum VR and they

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,310
are the two big ones that come up that

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
people are familiar with this break down

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,799
is sort of like my take on some of these

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,390
things really quickly VR is low volume

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,520
low capacity meaning you're not gonna

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,369
you're not gonna touch as many users

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,020
with VR as a technology but you might

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,439
give them a deeper experience and maybe

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,610
most AR experiences you can kind of read

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,509
this on your own and time is ticking so

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,909
I'm gonna focus on the AR part of that

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:49,500
the things that I like about a AR is

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,720
it's potentially a higher volume with

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,750
the caveat that you can get people to

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,250
actually adopt or install that AR

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,860
experience under their mobile device

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,119
which is still the primary platform for

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,860
AR conveyance unfortunately like a five

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,630
percent adoption rate for any sort of

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,220
application within the museum space is

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,900
just mind-blowing ly amazing two percent

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,860
is maybe more typical so that's why I

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,860
say sort of depend

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,900
adoption rate currently the experience

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,120
has heard more about the splash of AR

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,860
let's show an animated dinosaur the

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,570
general reaction is like what is this

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,920
specimen or object and how can we bring

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,520
it to life but it doesn't really get

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,170
deep into the narrative of the object it

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,940
leverages the user's device which means

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,700
you don't have to check in and out VR

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,710
equipment or audio equipment you don't

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,230
have to manage hygiene at all nobody

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,850
needs to be cleaning these things and it

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,530
better supports in a pond boarding

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,730
potentially you don't need somebody

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,100
there to train users so generally a are

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,870
in museums it's really about wayfinding

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,400
like how do you get from point A to B

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,380
how do you find the content that you're

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,060
looking for it's about these sort of

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,720
surprising moments it's kind of a little

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,060
shallow and very often sort of that

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
content that is in these experiences is

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,600
relegated from the editorial content

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,940
that didn't make the initial cut what

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,860
didn't end up on the museum wall ends up

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,060
and maybe the AR application support

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:19,440
application let's see we got over there

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,910
over there the hard thing about AR is

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,799
that we don't really have strong

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,290
precedents we have a lot of museums that

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,120
are investing in this space but it's not

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,580
I haven't seen something as made a

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,130
really compelling argument for the

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,019
application of AR and so there's sort of

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,160
the sense of cautious optimism and even

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,950
when I'm consulting with the Smithsonian

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,470
I'm cautiously optimistic I know there's

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,780
a use of AR that is going to be exciting

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,049
and powerful but you have this whole

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,030
host of potential issues some museums

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,590
are sort of conserved conservative in

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,120
nature and so there's this kind of

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,430
friction or resistance to the adoption

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,380
of new technologies and so you end up

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,540
having to come up with arguments to

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,900
anticipate these a big one is bullet

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,980
point two in this column that

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,690
entertainment is generally a dirty word

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,130
I was admonished recently for using

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,060
entertainment in account in a meeting

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,459
and everybody was just like stop don't

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,780
use that word as a cool actually museums

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,459
are sort of whether they like it or not

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,079
in the entertainment business in

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,970
entertainment as a word doesn't mean

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,130
shallow experience you can have an

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,390
experience of depth but that's sort of a

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,260
wall that you have to get through our

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,450
finding let's see couple product related

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,230
or technology related issues is image

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,340
anchoring GPS is fantastic but if you're

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,170
using it to talk about an object here

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,300
its anchor on a wall might be appearing

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,370
anywhere within sort of this 10 to 15

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,840
foot space and so it's unreliable unless

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,660
you have some sort of support like

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,940
beacon technology to sort of triangulate

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,120
position and get a little bit more

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,860
specificity people are not yet used to

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,620
this idea of sort of the museum's of

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,020
having users look at a device in their

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,000
hand it seems it's like a competition

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,280
with content that is on the floor or on

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,840
the wall so there's sort of a resistance

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,490
to this idea this is a project I'm

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,530
currently working on it was rolled out

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,970
at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:20,910
also a Smithsonian unit and it has a lot

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:22,500
of qualities that I'm excited about so

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,960
basically what it is it's a browser

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,080
based AR experience doesn't require any

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,570
app install and in theory if lighting

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,280
and all Universal you know sort of like

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,840
qualities are aligning you should be

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,930
able to open your mobile device and go

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,190
to this URL high dot s IIED you and

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:45,600
experience this AR right now by pointing

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,410
your camera at that object things that I

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,810
like about this idea it's not delivering

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,550
a lot of content it's not doing a lot of

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,530
animation it's not doing the splash

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,420
however it doesn't require any

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,700
application install which is a huge

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,870
advantage because there's I said earlier

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,490
there's usually like a two percent

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,930
adoption rate for apps within the museum

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:11,460
space was anybody trying this curious

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:14,850
yeah did it work cuz this is a gamble

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,050
I'm taking and I'm sure the museum that

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,090
they were like you're talking and you're

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,670
showing the content in front of the room

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,000
outside of the museum space they may not

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,650
love that I'm not sure um but the idea

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
that this is actually then a portable

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,550
experience is also fascinating that you

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,710
could kind of curate your own sort of

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,590
experience is based on museum content I

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:39,750
can give people another second to try

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:45,610
that I can do another image just

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:47,410
to throw you off and this is exciting to

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,510
me because of the portability of it I

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,890
also being kind of an agitator I like

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,230
the idea that it's sort of a neat an

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,800
idea that you could sort of subvert

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:59,170
easily to sort of curate your own

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,030
Hirshhorn Museum experiences at home or

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,300
in an alleyway or in your mom's basement

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,360
wherever it is is this working for

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,000
people except when I switch slides I'll

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,310
get great so there are certain kinds of

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,830
content types that the experience has a

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:19,150
video there are certain kinds of card or

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,150
copy based content types but it's sort

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,100
of limited to that at the moment this is

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,610
functionally at a very very high level

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,110
how it works at the top here the

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,720
institution will document an object say

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,490
it's that chair they'll take 100 to 200

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,040
photos from various angles of that

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,960
object that will then be uploaded to a

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,350
server hosted by a company called

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,240
Ketchum in Spain and then whenever a

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,200
user points their mobile device at that

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,610
object it references the server in Spain

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,950
for the image recognition that

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,100
information is then handed back to the

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:57,400
users device and the AR experience is is

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,320
displayed so there's sort of this

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,930
network of relationships is happening

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,940
between say the Smithsonian LinkedIn

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,250
which is the image host and this company

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,860
linked linked by air they're based in

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,510
Brooklyn New York and they are the ones

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,350
who are actually managing so the front

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,420
end development of the application and

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,930
what we're finding with this experience

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,970
is that visitors really like the insider

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,620
information they like this idea that

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,220
they're getting some sort of exclusive

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,640
dish on objects they respond very well

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,229
to video video particularly like after

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,210
30 seconds we're seeing sort of a

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,790
drop-off an attention span or sort of

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,110
dwell time is in the experience and so

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,390
we're trying to figure out how to edit

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,250
content and video is sort of optimized

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,610
towards that sort of like punchy little

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,350
moment people are interested in the

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,510
people's stories behind objects they're

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,400
liking that they enjoy the dinosaurs but

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,230
in the museum space like Smithsonian

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,520
they're in front of the dinosaur

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,510
and they're finding that the content

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,750
they really like is about the

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,400
paleontologists or the you know the

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,350
paleo biologist or somebody like this

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,290
who's conducting research about the

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:08,680
object our visitors not surprisingly

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,500
don't like to read and what we found

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,130
also is even though the experience

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,420
itself works pretty well we get the most

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,240
adoption rate when there's somebody on

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,430
the floor next to the user saying oh go

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,990
to the website and you can do this thing

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,790
even though there's instructionals

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,950
around on the walls and all these things

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,540
still requires a little bit of like

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,070
in-person training for the adoption

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:38,170
things I'm sort of excited about one is

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:40,810
pushing high high though the platform at

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,670
the Hirshhorn to learn what it's really

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,650
good at like right now we're showing

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,510
text and we're showing video but as a

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,640
game designer I'm also really curious to

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,230
see like thinking beyond the use of AR

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,910
as a scavenger hunt what kind of game

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,250
experiences can be designed using this

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,750
platform one of the things I'm really

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,080
excited about is like a hour and

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,060
chatbots the ability to push content to

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,740
users based on location where they are

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,620
what object or specimen they've actually

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,890
maybe just downloaded and looked at

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,390
being able to then through a SMS or text

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,560
keep them updated on other kinds of

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,750
content right here I've included this

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,040
just because I love it it's actually

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,050
some friends of mine at a company called

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,180
patched reality and they're based in

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,210
Chicago and they made this a our

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,810
experience using sixty-day i and it's

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:32,250
basically it's using sort of like a

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,290
natural language programming to spawn

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,320
commands using a like google image word

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,600
library to control these bunnies so you

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,820
could say like bunny and through AR it

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,620
spawns a bunny into the space need a

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,590
limited set of controls you could give

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,540
the bunny like follow me or play a game

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,150
you can feed them you can do things like

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,160
that I'm currently talking to them about

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,330
the idea of turning these into docents

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,360
or tour guides where you could say hey

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,460
bunny show me the t-rex and the bunny

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,620
will spawn it will actually have the

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,560
floor plan of the museum and it can just

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,990
be like

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,400
Cusick content and while it's doing that

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,900
it's also sir maybe learning a little

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,460
bit a little bit about you it could be

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,770
learning sort of at what pace are you

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,750
consuming content so we can always kind

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,820
of linger within your periphery it could

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,010
start to suggest and push other

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,260
suggestions to you as you're sort of

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:30,470
collecting data about the user like I

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:32,120
love this kind of relationship and it

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,770
also starts to dissolve the walls

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,300
between sort of education and

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,770
entertainment you know it can be playful

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,790
it can be fun and it can also be a

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,570
vehicle for getting to rich content the

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,700
other thing we're thinking about

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,140
chatbots there's one idea that interests

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,690
me is chatbot says you could have

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,180
multiple scripts so you could experience

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,580
an exhibition from the perspective of

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,880
the curator or from the exhibition

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,820
designer or from the paleontologist and

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,430
this could also be taken gone through a

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,660
Chapa or through a are maybe some

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,820
combination of the two that is what I

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,340
have that was sort of a little fast

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,290
blitz thank you very much

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:18,960
[Applause]

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,810
[Music]

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,660
you

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,660
