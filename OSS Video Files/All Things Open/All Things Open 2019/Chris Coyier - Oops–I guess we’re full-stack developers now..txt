Title: Chris Coyier - Oops–I guess we’re full-stack developers now.
Publication date: 2019-11-05
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	A few years ago we were front-end developers. These days, as the tools we use to build the web are getting better, easier, and more powerful, we’ve suddenly become full-stack developers. Let’s take a look at what happened and how we can take full advantage of our new super powers.

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:18,110
alright so next up we've got Chris

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,300
Koya so Chris is a web designer and a

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:25,759
developer has been for a number of years

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:28,880
as the creator of CSS tricks there's a

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:31,130
CSS tricks fan over there and and the

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,110
co-founder of code 10 and has a pretty

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,480
amazing podcast as well and Chris is

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,160
going to come and talk about about full

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,930
stack developers give him a big round of

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,010
applause please all right we're gonna

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,360
talk about front-end development cuz

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,129
that's all I know about so if you

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,410
absolutely don't care about that then

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,820
see a vendor or something but with a

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,850
changing landscape of front-end

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,370
development I think it's absolutely

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,899
fascinating right now and it's morph to

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,360
to kind of a full stack world like it or

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,100
not too bad what is a front-end

00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,809
developer cliche way to start a talk

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,780
whatever we're gonna do it anyway it's a

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,970
job and I think that's crucial because

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,160
it's it's how you make money in the

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,800
world like people care about that pretty

00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,630
deeply when it has to do with how you

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,000
make money in the world you care like a

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,380
whole bunch so you know there's an

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,910
earthquake underneath front-end

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,209
development it's at best uncomfortable

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,590
you know so that's what's happening a

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,420
little bit but even front-end developer

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,729
what is it well the front-end part is

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,470
browsers and assistive technology like

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,209
that's the front-end part of front-end

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,429
probably not terribly surprising to

00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,780
people or a browser nerd if you're a

00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,849
front-end developer there's a whole

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,860
landscape of browsers it's fascinating

00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:39,020
and hard and it's an yeah they call it

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,520
an infinite unknown canvas that makes

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,190
being a front-end developer kind of a

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,420
pain in the ass sometimes

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,640
but you're a browser assistive tech

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,679
person that's that's the job that's the

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,270
front-end part it's not that other roles

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:51,860
don't have the browser open to they do

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,509
but whatever and the browser's don't

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,670
exist all by themselves they run on

00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,140
devices they run on your laptops and

00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,030
phones and refrigerators and whatever

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,310
else crap these days this compass is all

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,800
about it I'm sure so and there's a whole

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,690
landscape of those two extra pain in the

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,030
ass okay still should be a highly paid

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,349
job at this point and then of course

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,550
they're they're not alone either it's

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,690
about the people and that's the most

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,450
important thing it's about the people

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,650
who use browsers on devices that's what

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,140
makes you a friend and developer and

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,000
that hasn't changed that much I mean the

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,740
devices thing is relatively new but not

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,650
really at this point you know front-end

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,090
developers about people who use brow

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,819
there's on devices and you're taking

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,890
care of that situation so because you're

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,959
a browser person you need to know the

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,030
languages that run in those browsers for

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,950
the most part which are the classics of

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,060
front-end development they you know

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,879
there's all kinds of tooling around

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,590
those languages but those change and

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,109
they come and go and those languages

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,090
tend to not come and go they evolve too

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,590
but a little bit more slowly and they

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,390
matter and you need to know them because

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,340
that's what browsers speak and you're a

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,040
browser nerd so like it's gonna come up

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,599
at work like these languages there so

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,150
yeah some somebody's got to know them

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,000
because it's it's a it's gonna matter to

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,799
some degree so it's interesting that not

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,290
all developers know all of those

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,209
languages equally well and that's fine I

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,250
mean the world is a diverse place in

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,959
that way - I know plenty of front-end

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,500
developers who are just like HTML and

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,209
CSS people very talented at that and you

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,519
know happily gainfully employed and

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,099
stuff maybe like less jobs and that

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,319
lately for better or worse certainly a

00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,090
lot more jobs and focus around the

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,220
JavaScript ecosystem and stuff this is

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,949
an essay I wrote earlier this year about

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,199
that interesting thing that's happening

00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,359
this puck isn't necessarily about that

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,160
but we're kind of just because the world

00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,930
is a lot more JavaScript focused lately

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,370
are gonna talk about that more because

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,720
that's you know if we're talking about

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,000
this earthquake under the feet of

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,590
front-end developers that's that's

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,389
what's happening so let's talk about

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,430
that I think the most significantly

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,650
interesting part of all this is that a

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,479
lot of stuff that used to be like under

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,430
the purview of back-end developers has

00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,769
kind of picked up and walked over to be

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,690
front-end develop more land and stop

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,060
there which is hence the full stack

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,370
thing let's talk about that one of the

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,430
most interesting things to me has this

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,519
is kind of shaken out already is that we

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,489
build you eyes with components now

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,650
that's just already been decided for us

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,329
in a way interesting in a way that kind

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,010
of wasn't the case when that for more

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,570
server-side rendered and stuff just

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,430
because they I don't know they didn't go

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,930
there so another thing that's probably

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,610
obvious to most of you in here if you're

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,020
in the friend development world you know

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,060
like react is huge

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,590
but you know it's really huge all of the

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,810
front-end frameworks together

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,029
I mean front ends are just largely just

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,099
built from the the you know the big

00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,190
players of JavaScript frameworks these

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,760
days they

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,290
to fight with each other argue about the

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,730
merits of what they're doing and all

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,220
that and the people that use them like

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,970
to bicker about things you know for

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,560
better or worse

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,660
but there's one thing they all weirdly

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,730
just agree on is that all front end is

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,790
components now even the native web

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,550
technology web of components is

00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,140
components yeah okay cool so and there's

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,400
a good reason for that and it's just the

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,750
things that we're building or starting

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,730
to get more complicated and it feels

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,040
good to chunk together things in

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,760
responsibility look like I want to write

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,830
semantic HTML I like clean good CSS and

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,170
intelligent well-written JavaScript but

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,970
I want to check it together because it's

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,680
just how my team talks and how they

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,690
think and how they want to build things

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,330
it just makes sense to build websites

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,270
out of like isolated responsibility

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,560
chunks his website you know sure you

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,990
know group that all that stuff together

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,060
and chunk it it's just a way to work

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,760
because websites tend to be just like

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,680
nested chunks of stuff like that it

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,330
that's kind of stuff is shaken out

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,850
already to be the way that we build you

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,200
eyes now or you know not every website

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,400
in the world but a lot of them it's good

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,320
we're talking about the future where

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,880
things are going let's look at this

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,810
through the lens of code pen and app

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,900
that I work on

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,550
like what here makes sense to be a

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,310
component well let's zoom in pretty damn

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,230
far that little heart icon down there I

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,090
hope you can see it's just a tiny little

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,980
icon of course that makes sense in a UI

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,320
world to build that with a little piece

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,590
of inline SVG and sure enough in the Dom

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,120
that ends up as inline SVG but in our

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,130
development you know in our kind of code

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,680
base it expresses itself as a component

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,750
of our own creation called an SVG icon

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,770
component and it's just an abstraction

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,720
of the nice like semantic HTML chunk and

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,419
all the accessibility stuff and sizing

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,070
stuff and like SVG best practices that's

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,870
how it ends up in the Dom but I do like

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,360
the developer ergonomics of it is just

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,040
like it's an SVG icon and then a way if

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,810
things change or we need to do

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,310
intelligent things we change the

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,230
component and it sprinkles its way

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,180
throughout the whole app it's a nice way

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,860
for us to work now what else is the

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,770
component well you don't have to zoom

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,660
out very far to see more kind of

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,419
intelligent chunking of responsibilities

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,250
like just that icon next to a number

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,670
that's another component because it has

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,920
a totally different little

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,140
of responsibility it has a number so

00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,310
there's like data handling

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,340
responsibilities it has a tiny little

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,410
CSS grid to layout the icon next to the

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,790
number and it has like a click handler

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,200
on it because if you click it that data

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,210
needs to change and go back to the

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,830
database it's a different chunk of

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,410
responsibility and when you're building

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,700
you eyes it makes sense to combine them

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,090
like that or at least it does for us

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,220
honor our team component tree you zoom

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,350
out that's a nice little component for

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,760
us the previews a nice little component

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,100
the header is a nice little component

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,650
those get grouped together in an item or

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,760
a card component which I'm sure

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,400
everybody in this room has built a card

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,740
of some kind it's just nice it just

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,690
matches how our team works and talks to

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,550
each other and thinks about the UI that

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,440
we're building together we can zoom out

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,020
a little further and be like the grid is

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,630
a component literally a CSS grid lays

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,790
out that component that we built but it

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,970
also has pagination responsibilities

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,020
built into it so it's like a chunk of

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,750
responsibility that makes sense and how

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,250
we're building this UI so componentry

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,110
everybody agrees that's how we build you

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,870
eyes now friend developers are like this

00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,130
is good for us designers are like way to

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
catch up that's how we've been thinking

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,760
forever about things and other

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,250
developers they're like whatever you

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,590
know components make sense got it so

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,240
let's let's look at that chunk again

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,350
there what else is a component here well

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,550
we might as well just componentize the

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,280
whole damn thing right through the title

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,960
component button use a tab component we

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,820
might as well zoom out just build the

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,620
whole thing out of components sure that

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,540
makes the whole pager component at that

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,310
point and then what you've kind of done

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,290
is you've just you've made the kind of

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,780
the URL a component at that level you've

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,610
said at that URL this is what I want to

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,920
render all this particular stuff and

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,600
that's become like a front-end concern

00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,130
if the front-end developers that are

00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,070
choosing how to chunk all that

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,780
responsibility then you're all the way

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,640
up to the URL level then you've kind of

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,830
become the architect of the entire site

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,660
then like front-end developers oh we

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:52,650
just do it all now is that cool is there

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:54,320
raise no so yeah like just it just adds

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,370
to the kind of the haystack of

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,870
responsibilities that we already had as

00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,670
front-end developers we'll look at that

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,560
more in a minute well if we look at this

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,300
lets let's kind of keep looking at that

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,130
there's I guess there's an OP clearly

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,540
data that needs to happen right there's

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,000
a bunch of avatars and titles and

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,350
usernames and stuff on there I think

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,180
most of us have the intuition that

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,320
that's data and it lives in a database

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,510
and if you want to show it on a website

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,470
you query the database and ask for it

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,300
and present it on the webpage yes great

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,370
as a front-end developer traditional and

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,810
be like I got this I'm gonna mock up

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,730
this page I'm gonna get it perfectly

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,830
ready for all kinds of scenarios and I'm

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,780
gonna think about accessibility and

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,910
performance and I'm gonna lay this thing

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,080
out according to the design specs and

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,210
get this thing all ready and then a

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,820
back-end developer says cool thanks I'm

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,560
gonna fill that up with the data that's

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,660
obviously necessary to make this page

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,220
that's becoming less and less true with

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,840
stuff like graph QL I'm sure there's

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,250
lots of great graph QL stuff in fact I

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,480
know there is at this conference I'd

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,800
love to sit around and talk about the

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,320
merits of graph QL but what's

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,280
interesting here is that it's kind of

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,410
like easiest to use and it's good it's

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,990
like a shopping list of data that you

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,940
need to fill up this area with with data

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,190
in what's significant about it in this

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,290
talk is that it's like moving that

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,940
backend responsibility picking it up and

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,560
giving it to front-end developers like a

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,540
front-end developers you want some data

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,400
for your mock-ups just fill out the

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,990
shopping list and it will arrive you

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,220
know there's a little bit more to know

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,900
but it's that shifting of a

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,120
responsibility that's interesting to me

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,570
it's Gibbs saying front-end developers

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,210
go get your own data fascinating to me

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,400
and it's not just always the Gidding of

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,870
data and the changing of data and state

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,580
management and that type of thing but

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,320
there's also the changing of data and

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,690
putting it back into a database which

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,060
was has long been scary to me and always

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,860
been a purview of back-end developers

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,120
like I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,590
click something and something's gonna

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
change in the website he needs to go

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,780
back to the database that's a data

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,760
mutation and that happens in on graph QL

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,130
and isn't terribly harder or more

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,690
difficult than than querying for the

00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,070
data to begin with so now all of a

00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,780
sudden as a front-end developer I'm in

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,520
charge of getting my own data changing

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,060
my own data putting the data back where

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,490
it needs to go Jesus

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,770
okay and it's starting to express itself

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,690
in like okay we're chunking components

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,330
together well view is no default routing

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,680
single file components the template in

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,720
the scripts and the styles are all

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,640
together in one file and angular has

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,590
folders of components in this case we're

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,620
using react and web pack and graph QL

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:26,230
and CSS modules and we're chunking the

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,090
all the files together I mean we

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,190
separate the files in this particular

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,250
case but they're combined into a folder

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,320
this is a chunk of responsibility that

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,360
is all together kind of just interesting

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,580
it's a nice way to build and think about

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,100
and work with your team on you eyes I

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,530
mentioned CSS modules briefly CSS Mudge

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,930
is like the lightest step you can take

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,340
into CSS in JavaScript you know a lot of

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,480
people have opinions about that but I

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,120
think it's pretty interesting I'm gonna

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,520
write some CSS that is intentionally

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,860
scoped to just the small piece of UI

00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,380
that I'm mentally dealing with right now

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,180
and I can't write CSS in there that's

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,370
gonna kick over a bar stool in another

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,550
bar as the joke goes it's scope to deal

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,020
with just that fascinating and it's not

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,240
only kind of a good idea but it makes

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,400
people that step into the project feel

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,440
safe in there and feel productive that I

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,060
can alter the styling in this little

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,400
place and not have to worry about it

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,560
elsewhere and there's just all kinds of

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,450
other interesting advantages to it so we

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,610
talked about component driven design how

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,500
front-end developers are doing that and

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,360
thinking about that which spreads all

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,820
the way to site level architecture and

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,980
dealing with URLs and getting data from

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,230
backends and changing data and dealing

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,120
with state management all new stuff that

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,060
has picked up and landed at front-end

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,410
developers doorstep fascinating in it

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,240
but it doesn't mean that like because

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,130
you have to do all that work now that

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,720
the world being a front-end developer

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,060
you have to do any less than you did

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,280
before they're still just like I don't

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,980
know doing the design you know like

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,350
making sure that this design that you've

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,840
been handed is pulled off efficiently

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,210
and nicely on the world's hardest canvas

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,000
to design for because it's infinite and

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,830
unknown and weird and exists on a

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,780
million devices and different browsers

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,850
it's your job to think systemically

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,370
about that design and implemented in a

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,350
way that you know perhaps is literally

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,060
using a design system that's so big

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,230
these days and you're dealing with the

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,270
accessibility because you

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,950
the front lines of accessibility you

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,870
know browsers and assistive tech is

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,150
where accessibility happens that's on

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,300
you front-end developers most of

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,770
performances focused on front-end

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,720
development you know 80 percent or

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,490
something is how things load on the page

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,530
and especially when you factor in

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,260
perceived performance that's a front-end

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,330
dev thing testing across that landscape

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,800
really carrying out the people who use

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,020
those browsers on those devices

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,880
experience your website that's you and

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,880
that's your job that's huge

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,030
already bless all the new stuff you know

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,310
just fascinating how wide the spectrum

00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,780
is got so the the haystack of crap for

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,730
front-end developer is bigger bigger

00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,310
bigger bigger bigger it's interesting

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,690
also the way we talk about this just the

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,460
way that you know just hallway

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,830
conversations about hey what's your

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,200
website like it changes to here's a

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,940
spectrum of skills from front end to

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,010
back just stuff that's traditionally

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,110
back in script stuff that's front end

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,730
you know there's a lot of websites out

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,120
there and old stacks still a very

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,040
popular stack Linux Apache MySQL PHP the

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,380
lamb stack when we say that we're

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,060
talking about stuff that's on the back

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,500
end and if I'm a front-end developer I'm

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,140
just like cool I'm over here apparently

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,270
I'm not a part of this stack that we're

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,970
gonna talk about this website with we're

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,640
separate and this changes over time

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,930
along comes the mean stack it's moved to

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,400
the right a little bit we're not talking

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,410
with the operating system anymore it's

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,760
probably Linux who cares you know like I

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,200
don't know doesn't matter

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,000
move to the right now we're talking

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,620
about we're even including JavaScript

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,240
frameworks in this acronym and it's

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,860
starting to overlap a little bit more

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,300
with me as a friend developer like

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,460
thanks for including me in your little

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,650
stack cool

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,620
you know serverless tech I'm hot on I

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,510
love it it's so cool it involves me more

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,640
and more like I think it you know this

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,790
existence makes me more powerful as a

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:10,090
front-end developer it's server-side you

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,120
know but it's probably node which is in

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,040
my purview as a JavaScript developer

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,480
meaning cool I can overlap with that at

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,100
least a little bit so if I'm a

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,930
JavaScript focus for any developer I

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,790
overlap with that more and more and then

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,060
we got you know Shawn Wang here giving a

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,160
talk yesterday about star like that's a

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,200
stack you're saying star is a way to

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,990
build a website star is design systems

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,030
typescript Apollo graph QL react no

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,010
we're way to the right the way we're

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,740
talking about what the stack that builds

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,240
that website totally overlaps with

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,380
front-end development and even goes off

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,180
the chart because it's talking about

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,290
design stuff so I'm like cool so

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,000
apparently the way we talk about

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:51,430
websites now is all me me me me thanks

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,830
people to Tucker my website cool so

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,480
first talking about the spectrum here in

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,220
my skill set I don't care about those

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,200
things that's not me I'm just gonna

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,090
slice those off of the world I don't

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,160
deal with databases either or I do but

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,870
I'm dealing with them through api's or

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,820
through a headless Thea master cuz I'm

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,770
static site generator something's I'm

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,690
not dealing with that crap so here's the

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,850
spectrum of skills that's left for me

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,500
I'll include server-side languages there

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,150
because thanks server list you know

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,920
maybe my JavaScript skills have

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,350
stretched into note a little bit so I'm

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,080
not afraid of that world so much these

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,790
things in the middle if I'm a JavaScript

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,250
focused front-end developer are my

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,020
bread-and-butter there but of course I'm

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,990
a front-end developer I'm speaking all

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,240
the languages of browsers so like be

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,240
like rainbow man here I got all that

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,600
rainbow is me and then you add to that

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,790
just the extra skills you know like

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,520
writing good emails and stuff but also

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,530
like I know get and I can do a little

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,180
design and I know about testing and

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,070
process and performance and

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,810
accessibility in like just other

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,790
tangential stuff that have to do with

00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,540
building websites if I know those things

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:08,110
too and I'm rainbow man unforced

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:10,870
no no no I am you know yeah

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,990
beautiful staff not me I'm terrible

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,689
that's done I just do talk but that

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,430
haystack is so big now like we talk all

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,170
the new stuff all the old stuff all the

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,750
tangential stuff hell of a haystack

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,000
you're probably not gonna be super duper

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,829
amazingly good at every single thing we

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,360
just talked about they're like probably

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,180
very few people in this room I'm

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,160
certainly not great at all that stuff so

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,050
like you know it's like should I

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,700
specialize well you don't have much of a

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,380
choice you're just like gonna specialize

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,960
you're just gonna be better at some of

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,540
that stuff than other stuff and fine

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,790
cool great you know like if you're alone

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,679
you know that's an interesting challenge

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,179
but a lot of us are just on teams and

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,160
work with other people and the ideas and

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,300
maybe that stuff can be paired together

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,190
so one of the thing that's kind of

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,040
interesting here when you're like cool

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,620
we're full-stack now there's gaps in

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,290
that full stack thing and a lot of times

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,320
full stack you just at the moment in the

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,330
industry kind of hires a little heavier

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,970
on the backend side so you're a full

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,760
stack but maybe what falls away a little

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,700
more commonly is that HTML CSS stuff

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,650
which leads to the horse it's the horse

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,390
the horse problem you know like sure

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,220
you're full stack hey at least it's a

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,940
horse you know at least it can move

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,559
kinda but like sometime you know that's

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,690
happens to be where the gap is I think

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,630
the horse is frickin hilarious but I'm

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,910
also I'm not the horse like I have so

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,530
light little tiny backend skills because

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm fascinated by serverless and I've

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,340
just been around long enough to have

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,690
some skills across the board but my

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,480
skills and interests are way more

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,630
front-end focused so I'm like to drag in

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,130
a little more dragon II there's me and

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,190
I'm kind of hoping that I'm on a team

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,710
where we can complement each other that

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,020
like ideally somebody has paired me up

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,490
with the horse and I can be the dragon

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,340
and we'll just be like a cool horse

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,559
dragon like that's super ideal that

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,030
would be that would be great for me and

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,880
hopefully somebody can come in and be

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:11,200
the wing because you know that's cloud I

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,910
guess let's call the wing fly so nice

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,120
you know like it's just a full you know

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,100
there's all kinds of possible

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,690
and stuff lots of stuff has changed you

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,210
know getting a job as weirder the

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,620
landscape is weirder I'm sure a lot of

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,960
people have thoughts about this good

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,610
news we're gonna do a Q&A and just talk

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,740
about it all together right after this

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,850
so that's kind of nice so if your mind

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,490
is reeling with thoughts

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,409
hang out with me but what hasn't changed

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,690
is that we're all still browser people

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:37,130
we all deal with the users who use you

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,950
know browsers which is this infinite

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,630
unknown canvas of I should say

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,130
terribleness but it's pretty great but

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,419
it's hard to work in browsers you know

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,090
there's all kinds of crap think about

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,679
who are shepherds of UX and shepherds of

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:52,070
performance and accessibility all this

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,600
stuff that hasn't changed so let's just

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,760
do right by those people who use

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,420
browsers or let's just do right by them

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:07,829
thanks everybody for listening

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:07,829
[Applause]
