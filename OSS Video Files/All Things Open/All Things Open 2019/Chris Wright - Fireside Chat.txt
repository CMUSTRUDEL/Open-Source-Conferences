[Music]

00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,389
all right so we're gonna bring onstage

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,320
someone who's far more interesting than

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,639
I am

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:25,859
please put your hands together for Chris

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:29,460
Wright CTO of Red Hat all right

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,230
hello sir that was good that was weird

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,420
is what that was he went into his

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,969
contract no breakdancing otherwise it

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,649
was gonna it was gonna be magic yeah you

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,840
don't want to see that very bad it's

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,320
worse than bad dancing so before we get

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,550
started and if the AV people could stick

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,030
a clock on the screen that would be very

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,320
helpful for both of us just tell us a

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,879
little bit about yourself tell us about

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,770
your background cuz didn't you spent

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
some time as a kernel developer and

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,320
you've been involved in projects like

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,329
open daylight so let's hear a little bit

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,440
for those of those of us who don't know

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,859
about you everything

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,369
sure so Chris right love long walks on

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:11,400
the beach action movie no this is an

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:14,070
awkward date I started as a engineer

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,880
doing work in the telecommunications

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,909
field and all of the work that I did was

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,700
proprietary software and it was all

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,090
developed using open source tool chains

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,470
right and so son site was the place to

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,619
go to get all the good stuff and

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,070
somewhere along the way I fell into a

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,780
project called Linux HEA and I was

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,490
responsible for the availability of our

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,479
platform which in telecommunications

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,509
world big deal yeah and through a series

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,399
of totally random events really I just

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,590
kept meeting interesting people right at

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,659
a conferences and I ended up working on

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,090
really interesting technology in the

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,829
kernel and security spaces specifically

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,930
and then ultimately virtualization and

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,640
it all kind of one thing leads to the

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,280
next and it was software-defined

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,259
infrastructure and writes Sdn and it

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,420
became really buzzword compliant and I

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,160
have not left buzzword compliance since

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,420
then

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,800
that's the nickel to so it's just

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,500
essentially just bouncing

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
as as the technology was evolving you

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,990
were just finding your home in these

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,980
different places that were evolving

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,360
which I think it's one of the most

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,690
incredible things I'm sure many people

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,510
here have a similar experience what led

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,770
you to how did you get to Red Hat that's

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,660
a great question so I was working on a

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,600
virtualization project hypervisor

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,340
project called Zen and the the CTO at

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,470
the time was really working hard to

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,990
recruit me to come to Red Hat in it I

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,690
was working for a nonprofit organization

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,500
called OS DL which would now be better

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,020
known as the LF yep and I really had a

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
great job and so I kept telling Brian no

00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,120
hmm and I had a long list of excuses

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,810
each of which he had a very credible

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,710
response to and my final ditch effort

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,440
was well my wife is eight months

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,960
pregnant with our first child I'm not

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,900
making too significant life changes he's

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,060
a big chase all right right so about at

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,120
what two or three weeks after she was

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,810
born I do know this this this like

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,020
parenting stuff is not that hard so I

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,720
called Brian back and I accepted the job

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,420
which I realize only then that my

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,690
in-laws were still visiting right the

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,340
baby slept a lot at weird times but

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,520
somehow it wasn't as hard as it got a

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,290
little later it was two big life changes

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,640
at once but right really happy I did it

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,400
that was like 15 years ago that's

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,230
awesome so one of the things when we

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,790
were talking before when we were talking

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,590
about doing this we were talking a

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,370
little bit about how Linux has really

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,190
become a platform and all of these other

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,860
elements of innovation of spun up around

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,270
this evolution of Linux and we've I'd

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,280
like you to talk a little bit of and

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,150
share everyone your perspective on that

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,830
because I think it's a really

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,390
interesting way of looking at how open

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,300
source has kind of evolved throughout

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,859
the years and where you see the platform

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,989
moving forward specifically yeah well

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:22,540
Linux is where I got started I you know

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:25,120
I did my first Linux install on

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,030
an old 486 box in my basement and

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,630
probably 95 or something was that was a

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,920
lot of it

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,440
it was Slackware it was a lot of

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:39,730
floppies and yeah boy it was you you

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,850
could be selective and and a long time

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,120
spent in configuring graphics if you

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,370
remember a grater and all that so that

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,480
was that you know that was my my

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,900
experience with Linux in the very

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,840
beginning which was super fun really

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,890
interesting like from a technology

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,360
technologists point of view the

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,300
opportunity to get under the hood and

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,650
see how things work totally love that

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,440
nothing that I would call polished or

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,250
easy to use right or mainstream Abul at

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,910
all

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,980
so as I got involved in doing Linux

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,800
professionally and and ultimately being

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,650
in the position I'm in today looking at

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,520
the development of Linux not just as a

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,760
kernel but really a critical and core

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,220
piece of technology that if you if you

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,980
look at it today it's absolutely

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,230
everywhere yeah I mean it's it's in an

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:36,040
Android phones in my pocket it's in my

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,410
TVs it's cars yep Planes Trains servers

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,060
do you can't imagine a place that

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,760
doesn't have a Linux operating system

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,030
running inside what's associated with

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,270
that is a ton of activity in two key

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:53,440
areas one is all of the open source

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,810
projects around the world tend to be

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,400
targeting Linux not exclusively you can

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,960
find exceptions to that but there's you

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,460
know there's just a vast array of

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,030
excitement enthusiasm and innovation

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:11,080
that happens in and around Linux which

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:15,190
is fun and and and fascinating and then

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,200
if you look at the commercial side the

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,210
whole industry is really rallied around

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,850
this core platform and I think that is

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,100
what makes it so fundamentally valuable

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,960
right if you think about everything that

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,630
you experience on a day-to-day basis its

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,730
queries its social interactions through

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,800
social media all of these somewhere in

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,430
the background or even in the foreground

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,200
in your phone are powered by Linux

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,420
there's a whole commercial ecosystem

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,240
that has decided this is the platform

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,640
that we're going to essentially de facto

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,670
standardize our efforts around right

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:50,440
which has enabled that plus some clever

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:54,440
engineering has enabled Linux to evolve

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,480
or well quarter-century and stay

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,390
relevant right yet the at the leading

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,790
edge so I think this notion of a

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,800
platform is we have these arguments

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,450
internally what's a platform because we

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,980
have different layers it could be an

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,990
application platform it could be

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,180
infrastructure layers hmm but the notion

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,150
that you have a place where people bring

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,490
together a set of common requirements

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,590
and then work on those to get right and

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,120
advanced the entire state of the art for

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,150
the whole industry I mean if 20 years

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,680
ago if you would have told me that

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,890
billions of dollars a year would be

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,280
spent into an open source based industry

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,600
and some multiplier on that would be the

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,130
money generated through all the

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,450
transactions that are processed in those

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,710
systems right I just wouldn't have

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,210
believed you right I was gonna say

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,340
something similar which is this has been

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,440
a pretty short timeline something so

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,630
significant when you think it's it's not

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,640
just the operating system and it's all

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,020
of thee it's all of the tool chain

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,330
that's being built out as well and of

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,730
course as the cloud has been as kind of

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,170
evolved as we've gone from kind of on

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,180
Prem in through to the cloud with a

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,380
hybrid cloud as well it's been

00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,330
incredible to see that this has all been

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,920
wrapped around this platform and how we

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,450
build software right how have you seen

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,500
that for example change at Red Hat

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,120
because in those years

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,010
I mean Red Hat were well known in the

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,050
early days especially it's been and of

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,490
one of the first early companies that

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,350
were investing into a free software and

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,180
open source and obviously Red Hat is a

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,100
hugely successful company today how have

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,840
you seen that relationship with a

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,270
platform adjust and evolve er for those

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,120
years well one thing that has not

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,130
changed when this has surprised me

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,430
initially there was we had to get people

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,890
over the the kind of FUD associate with

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,180
open source who are all these hippies in

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,470
their basements for writing in code and

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,610
why am i running my business on it that

00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,850
doesn't make sense I don't believe you

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:41,440
that it's safe right that went away but

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,690
all of the kind of evangelism and

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,610
education around open source

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,100
surprisingly to me has not so I spend a

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,079
lot of my

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,630
I'm talking to a lot of people about

00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:53,639
some of the same topics and sometimes I

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,279
think okay this is kind of boring but

00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,019
what I realize is that's a form of

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,899
success because what that really means

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,490
is there are continual new waves of

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,220
people coming into this broad movement

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,139
that was a fringe radical thing and now

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,389
it's completely mainstream yeah so

00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,529
there's there's that which is changed

00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,420
internally and we've had different

00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,649
thoughts about how much open source

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,329
needs to actually be a part of our

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,759
messaging or not because right depends

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:20,399
on where the industry is and then the

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,170
notion of a platform and where we fit

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,100
into the ecosystem and what we're trying

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,380
to do has actually been kind of a

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,319
binding glue throughout the longevity of

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,980
our story and today that platform looks

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,410
quite different

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,060
except it's still Linux at the very core

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,459
which is the Breitling that I I really

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,079
really enjoy yeah and when you think the

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,730
way I think about it is we were working

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:46,199
on Linux and as servers and bespoke the

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,569
handcrafted special artisan snowflakes

00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,589
of an application on a server that you

00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,990
don't ever touch because you're afraid

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,740
it will break to today with immutable

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,120
images big scale out infrastructure

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,540
orchestration to manage all of this

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,889
which in my mind is is kubernetes and

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:08,910
the way the broad open source ecosystem

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:12,180
and the vendor commercial ecosystem is

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,850
rallying around that same kind of common

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,670
technology right way right it's really

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,579
exciting yet because that is plain the

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,550
same kind of pattern out in a very new

00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:25,620
way right realizing things that I know

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,079
I've worked on for decades which is big

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,930
complicated clustering distributed

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,880
systems none of those problems have gone

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,490
away but the way we've evolved and how

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,980
we solved those problems is really even

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,300
he merged with some amazing technologies

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,040
and how do you where do you see the

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,930
relationship of the distribution because

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,310
back for example you know when you

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,560
started out and I also started out with

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,420
slack where as well there was the notion

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
of this collection of software that you

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,660
bring together and you install a

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,459
distribution and that's where you go

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,470
from and now of course with with the

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,120
cloud and orchestration the way in which

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,740
we think about how we consume software

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,250
is changing how have you seen that

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,319
adjust over the years

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,439
well there's a small part of me that

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:09,230
cries inside because I love the details

00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:12,889
and I love the complexity right but I

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:17,300
think maybe why you recede you maybe I

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:19,730
think that today even people who also

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,279
love the details right they just don't

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,189
have time yeah to become what I

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,250
described as mastering the arcane we

00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:29,839
used to celebrate the most obscure

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,480
command-line argument and knowing that

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,540
meant you were kind of a rock star today

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,180
if you can't do something quickly with

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,339
essentially as minimal effort invested

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,410
hmm to get to an outcome that's

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,160
important to you right then you're just

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,680
not gonna do it

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,259
yep and so the way software is consumed

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,689
I think today is really in large part

00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:52,250
informed by what clouds have done and

00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:56,209
how you can consume software as nervous

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,889
so being able to make it so easy to

00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:00,019
provision whatever it is you're trying

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,180
to provision and engage with it quickly

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:06,620
is the current most critical thing right

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,990
which isn't the same as giving you a

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,879
thousand ways to tune something right oh

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,389
I see so it's almost like the user

00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,339
interface to the technology in many ways

00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,170
is the distribution right the way in

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:19,910
which you package up the technology and

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,670
provide it that's right it's kind of

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,040
many ways is less relevant in some ways

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,879
as its back to make it sort of red hat

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,350
specific just so it's concrete one of

00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,389
the things that we do is take a bunch of

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,800
different pieces and combine them

00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,620
together and a relatively well defined

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,959
and prescriptive way yeah to help you

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,939
know we're trying to create this balance

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,040
between choice and those thousands of

00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,790
configuration knobs and ease of use

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,259
right

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,019
and I wouldn't say we've got it perfect

00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,910
but that is that's the that's the

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,350
difference of yeah it was very much

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,329
packaged and you install it you've got

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,129
all these kind of building blocks and

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,259
like bricks and you figure out what

00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,689
you're going to do and today be more

00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,399
prescriptive and being able to more kind

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:03,980
of push button provision yeah ease of

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,879
interactions is is definitely right the

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,589
norm so it would be remiss if I didn't

00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:11,000
ask the question that I think a lot of

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,939
people in here are going to be wanting

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,810
to ask which is red hat was acquired by

00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:17,600
IBM

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,370
I can ask my favorite beer I wouldn't

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,590
actually what is your favorite beer I do

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,960
want to know depends on the season okay

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,100
I love IPAs I'm from Portland hipsters

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,480
alright so what is the how would you

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,730
describe the relationship between red

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,110
hat and IBM today because I mean we're

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,850
all familiar of companies who get

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,570
acquired and then they kind of go in and

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,839
they become subsumed into you know into

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:44,150
the the Machine and sometimes they lose

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,730
their their independence they lose their

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,620
identity a little bit and obviously red

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,170
hat is a company that people hold pretty

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,850
dearly in the open source world and I

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,320
think everybody is reassured by the fact

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,850
that of course like Jim is leather

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,670
company well you've led the company well

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,680
some amazing engineers there what's that

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,279
relationship with IBM today and where do

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,020
you see it in the future the most common

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,850
question I get is in this area and it's

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:14,600
really about what's going to change and

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,760
the focus that we have is we are a

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,339
company that builds our products from

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,900
open source projects we will continue to

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,430
do all of the work that we've always

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,410
done in open source communities because

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,730
it's so fundamental to who we are how

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,520
they operate how we build our products

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,060
how we engage with our kind of partner

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,950
ecosystem as well as as our customers so

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:40,430
if you think about the the major event

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,770
which is take a significant you know a

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,130
third of your market cap and put it down

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,740
on a relatively small company right

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,860
that's a major that's a major college

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,560
major bet it yeah and the the thing that

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,580
I'm really impressed by is the degree to

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,250
which every conversation is supporting

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,860
being committed to really red hat

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,990
retaining a level of Independence and

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,510
and the consistency the identity of our

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,830
brand who we are the culture of what we

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,670
do how we do it right

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:17,720
that is really front and center because

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,900
if you think about what you know what

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,370
value could we provide it's not the

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,250
intellectual property of a proprietary

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,320
bunch of bits yeah right yes all out

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,670
there so it's really who we are what we

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,330
do how we do it

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,730
and and then from our side we actually

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,250
have some some things that we can gain

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,810
which is a certain type of breadth and

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,730
scale that we wouldn't have been able to

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,010
do on our own right so you know I think

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,780
there is some complimentary capabilities

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,060
there so it's not like we have the

00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,500
better culture right versus their

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,660
culture it's really we have different

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,340
strengths and we're trying to figure out

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,640
where we work together with right

00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,830
predominant like first first class

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,250
citizen and this one is Red Hat is Red

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,960
Hat yeah and we retain independence

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,910
because a lot of what we're building is

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,190
around what we call the open hybrid

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,840
cloud and that's a shared vision right

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,150
right they want to accelerate that

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,240
vision we're building to that vision so

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,700
yeah and I think you know I mean anyone

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,960
who knows Red Hat knows though that

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,120
culture has been a really critical

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,060
element it you know the kind of the open

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,250
source way fundamental so I want to

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,610
broaden out a little bit because we're

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,350
seeing I think change is not necessarily

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,210
changes but different ideas around what

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,940
open source means in the last couple of

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,860
years so we've seen different attitudes

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,290
towards free software towards open

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,660
source what open core is we're seeing

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,030
new licenses that are coming out such as

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,490
Commons claws and different companies

00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,540
are coming in to invest in open source

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,850
we're seeing all of these different

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,130
inputs and I think a lot of people are

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,800
looking at all of this activity in

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,270
thinking what does all of this mean you

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,740
know where do we see the balance between

00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,240
all of these different ingredients that

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,280
have been mixed into this mixing bowl

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,200
how do you see this where do you see

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,180
open-source moving forward with all of

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,459
these different kind of inputs that are

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:12,980
kind of coming into it well on the one

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:14,630
hand I see it as open source has one and

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,100
what I mean by that is everything I

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,450
talked about the vien the platform the

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,160
investment all these open source

00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,250
communities all this industry that

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,950
surround these core platforms like Linux

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,980
and kubernetes right I mean that is

00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,120
unbelievable I would not have believed

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,990
you if you told me that's where we would

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,080
be today 20 years ago so open source is

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,190
one but that's come at a cost and what I

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,530
would way I describe it is it's the

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,120
corporatization of open source and now

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,130
we have all these questions there's so

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,900
much

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,670
financial interest involved in the

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,610
health and vitality of these projects

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:51,790
that there is a new set of kind of

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,770
politics that a lot of things that we

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:57,610
saw play out in standards bodies right

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,470
are kind of at risk of entering the open

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,120
source communities where it's you know

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,220
it's not necessarily it's this

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,540
collaboration but it's really we're

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:09,600
gonna collaborate as long as you take my

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:12,940
way right and so the the idea that

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,210
software could only be developed while

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,850
supported by a foundation is you know an

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,910
open question mark in my mind and the

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,650
relationship between the production of

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,150
software the developers and the

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,300
community that builds software together

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,640
and the consumers in an economic sense

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,950
is also shifting so we have all of these

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,570
things we've won like we should

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,700
celebrate come on it's awesome right

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,440
yeah go hello

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:44,590
go out there but that it's come at some

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,470
cost right in the cost I think is how do

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:51,220
we continue to onboard people into the

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,650
communities while preserving the best of

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,040
what we're capable of doing in in how we

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,560
build communities right in my mind is

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,960
it's about people it's about trust

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,270
relationships it's about a shared vision

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,660
about some technology that we mutually

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,130
care about right and distorting that

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,680
with a lot of financial interests

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,840
creates risk in preserving the culture

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,860
and and how do you feel like we strike

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,210
that balance because I get the

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,890
impression that what we're seeing right

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,890
now is a lot of people kind of like a

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,480
kid poking the edges of the universe I'm

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,700
trying to find their boundaries of what

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,650
open-source really means how do you

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,140
think we I think many people in here

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,820
will have a gut sense of what those core

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,430
principles are and what that means

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,440
to differing degrees how do you think we

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,330
define those core principles and

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,680
maintain them as we go through this

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,990
process

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:45,190
I what I've done write them down

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,600
evangelize them you know bounce them off

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,270
other people sees like does this make

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,480
sense and then I think about it this way

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,950
a an open-source license there's many of

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,430
them they've fall into an entire

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,470
spectrum if you read those licenses and

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,740
I've read a lot of those licenses it's

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:05,020
very rare that the license says you have

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,940
to give contributions back to the

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,370
development community where this source

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,160
code came from right back basically it

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,950
never says it exactly like that

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,420
there is a expectation that happens and

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,090
that is a community and cultural

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,660
expectation that's built from how we're

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,790
operating together so yeah we've chose

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,800
an Apache License which is relatively

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,730
unrestricted we chose a GPL which has a

00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,730
whole different set of requirements

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:33,370
around it those actually don't say you

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,340
have to give back how do we ensure that

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,710
that culture right of collaboration and

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:42,520
focusing on the enhancement of the

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,760
software as a project that we all care

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,010
about which is quite distinct from how

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,130
we may commercially productize it right

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,990
is kept clear those boundaries need to

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,570
be kept really clear you know the the

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,510
the culture part of it is so fundamental

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,980
and key so I'd say it's write it down

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,740
right share it with your friends

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,600
evangelize it and make that a part of

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,130
any software project that you're a

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,080
member of and that's something that we

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,000
all need to do yeah yeah it's a

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,730
collective yeah it doesn't collect the

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,080
VESA table takes a village person yeah

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,690
all right well thank you Chris it was a

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,650
pleasure

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:23,299
[Applause]

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:25,170
[Music]

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,999
