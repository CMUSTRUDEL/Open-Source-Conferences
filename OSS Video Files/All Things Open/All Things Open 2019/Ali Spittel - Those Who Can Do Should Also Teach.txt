Title: Ali Spittel - Those Who Can Do Should Also Teach
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Programmers are constantly learning new technologies, especially in the rapidly evolving frontend ecosystem. As a result, developers often find themselves in a teaching role — whether that means mentoring a colleague, writing blog posts, speaking at meetups, or even teaching more formally at a college or bootcamp.

So, how can you teach code more effectively? We’ll go over strategies for breaking down information, explaining concepts without jargon, using relevant examples, and engaging learners so that you can be more effective the next time you are in a teaching position.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,680
hey everybody this is exciting so I'm

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,120
going to be talking about my favorite

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,420
thing to do in the whole entire world

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,760
which is teaching people how to code so

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,770
my objectives for you all if you walk

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,100
away from us with a certain amount of

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:31,039
things from this talk they are to know

00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,730
the ways that you can teach hint you

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,100
probably already do you're gonna be able

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,100
to hopefully coach students on a

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,110
learning mindset so that they can be in

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,710
a positive place to learn in the first

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,630
place you're gonna know the mechanics of

00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,360
putting a lesson together and actually

00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,670
teaching it and then we're gonna go over

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,300
noodles of advice and things that I wish

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,250
that I knew when I started teaching so

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,770
why am I even talking about this in the

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,689
first place so learn to code for me was

00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,509
unnecessarily hard because of my college

00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,420
education I grew up in a tiny little

00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:13,459
town without even a stop sign or or

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,759
without stoplights or a grocery store

00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:19,130
and I didn't know what coding was until

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,200
I got into college I stepped in to do

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,189
computer science classroom thinking that

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,479
I was going to learn all about

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,799
formatting Microsoft Word documents

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,469
that's what I thought computer science

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,899
was and instead I was handed a piece of

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:35,840
paper with Python code on it and was

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,359
told to type it into a computer and it

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,490
was magic I was typing these things in

00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,880
and something else was coming out and

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,789
that was really really cool but it got

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,259
harder from there after that class where

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:50,990
I decided I was gonna become a computer

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,389
science major I was in a C++ class

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:58,489
teacher trying to learn data structures

00:01:53,389 --> 00:02:01,279
and algorithms on top of C++ itself it

00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:03,169
was a weed out class I made it through

00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:05,060
the weed out class but at the end of it

00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:07,520
I thought that programming wasn't for me

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,150
and so I quit there's no longer a

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,099
computer science major so then I started

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,920
teaching myself how to code because

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,409
at work I realized that I could automate

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,480
a lot of my own job if I wrote code to

00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:24,170
automate it so that pipe those Python

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,819
skills they transferred over and then I

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,680
accidentally became a software engineer

00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:33,109
from that same job but in college I was

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,680
an education minor so teaching people

00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:39,620
was so much fun for me I was in middle

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,069
schools teaching people I had a code and

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,680
that was a really cool process as well

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,829
as I became a software engineer and

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,079
worked my way through a couple levels at

00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:53,389
work I started getting more and more

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:57,260
involved in the community in my city in

00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:59,269
Washington DC and there I was being

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,819
asked to teach workshops and mentor

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,620
people and it came back out to the

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,590
things that I learned when I was in an

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,019
education classroom and I could also use

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,639
the learnings that I had that would have

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,409
helped me and so that I wouldn't have

00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,459
quit computer science when I was in that

00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:17,780
classroom from there some of my best

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,629
friends started working at a coding

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,680
bootcamp and they poached me and so I

00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,790
now Emily and instructor and

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,829
distinguished faculty member at General

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,939
Assembly spinning boot camp and it's the

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,229
best job in the world

00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:35,120
so I get to teach people how to code

00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,500
they get to go from hello world to

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,500
professional software engineers in

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,840
roughly 12 weeks it's a wild journey for

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,459
everybody involved including me but I

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,970
also get to teach teachers how to teach

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,310
now and that's really magical as well so

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,530
I also started making content on the

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,909
Internet two years ago so I've taught

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,220
thousands of people to come in person

00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:58,189
and millions online which is a really

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,239
cool thing to be able to say and those

00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,219
people have been from all different

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,909
walks of life

00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:06,500
newbies eighth graders junior engineers

00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:08,209
the people that I was mentoring when I

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,099
was at work the people in the community

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:14,299
all different types of people I've had

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:17,209
the privilege of teaching and you

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,769
probably teach people as well you may

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,979
answer people's questions on Stack

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,690
Overflow or dev or Twitter

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:26,240
you may mentor a junior developer at

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,400
work or just work with other people on

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
the

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,310
job you may start to create content you

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,130
may write blog posts and you may even

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,070
manage people or speak at conferences

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,229
like I am right now and everything that

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,759
I tell you today will apply to every

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,900
single one of these things you don't

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,430
have to quit your job and become a

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,490
bootcamp instructor like me but you

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:53,100
should it's fun so what have I gained

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,990
from teaching it's so much to even put

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,180
on one side but the first thing is

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,970
reinforcing your own knowledge again

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,770
most of my knowledge is self-taught so

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,750
there are a lot of holes in that and the

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,910
first time I was prepping for lessons I

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,490
was realizing those holes and filling

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,680
them in for my selves so I learned the

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,360
history of JavaScript the JavaScript

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,340
fundamentals in more detail all the

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,949
things that I skipped over to move on to

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,949
react because I was you know becoming a

00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:24,750
developer and 2015 ish during the

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:27,360
framework Wars days and I can build an

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,710
expressed cred has like 15 minutes

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,860
because they're teaching it so many

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,510
times I can delegate things to other

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,370
people so instead of having to do

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,340
everything myself I can teach somebody

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,560
else to do what I used to do so there

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,050
can be a lot more Me's I don't have to

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,370
do everything myself

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,740
people think that you're an expert I

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,530
thought I was giving a talk on augmented

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,940
reality today but I this was like last

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,610
week when I was looking at the schedule

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,710
I'm not an expert on argumented reality

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,409
I wrote a blog post about it and people

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,849
read that blog post and then they

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,830
started asking me to come speak about it

00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,419
and so people think that you're an

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,139
expert on things because you write about

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,810
them even if you're not and then the

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,669
best part is that you get to help people

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,520
you get to see their journeys you get to

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,229
add more people to the industry and they

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,639
get to learn things from you and that's

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,080
pretty cool so I want to transition into

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,120
talking about the mindset behind

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,710
teaching and the things that you have to

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,659
coach your students on in order to make

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,310
them successful because the most

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:32,159
important part of teaching isn't

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,500
necessarily teaching them any individual

00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,659
framework or line of code or anything

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,370
like that it's teaching them how to

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,550
teach themselves and so we're going to

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,110
talk about the mindset

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,650
you have to coach your students to in

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,560
order to make them successful learning

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,500
anything is really really hard learning

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,640
programming is even harder it usually

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,040
it's hard to put yourself in that

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,860
beginners mindset again I work with

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,750
people who were corporate executives and

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,790
then they're going back to absolute zero

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,530
in a classroom and writing a hello world

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,660
and that's something that's really

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:11,020
really hard for people to do you have to

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,370
put yourself in their shoes what was it

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,500
like for you to learn something really

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,540
hard I try to make it so that I'm always

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,520
trying something new and always putting

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,920
myself in beginner shoes so that I can

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,270
empathize with my students so doing

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,010
things like starting CrossFit or any of

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,360
those things that I am new at will make

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,640
me relate more to my students you also

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,740
have to coach them into embracing this

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,170
challenge it's really really hard again

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,440
to learn anything new and so if you have

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,690
to coach them to embrace that and be

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,220
excited about it and not be fearful of

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,130
it because as developers we're learning

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,870
new things every day you probably have

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,280
learned new things over the course of

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,350
this conference and having that growth

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,380
mindset of that new thing being awesome

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,230
and something really cool to learn is a

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,240
huge component behind learning to code

00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,070
so having a growth mindset and being

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,090
excited about learning new things and

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,740
changing is a huge part of that there's

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,680
this idea of the emotional cycle of

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,290
change so you probably go through this

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,420
multiple times a day as a developer so

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,490
first you start off with uninformed

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,520
optimism there's this new shiny

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,760
framework out there and it looks awesome

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,980
this is so much fun to do I want to

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,570
learn all about it and you write the

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,770
hello world the hello worlds easy enough

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,690
you got it but from there you start to

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,780
struggle a little bit it gets a little

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:42,190
bit harder you get into the informed

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:44,470
havesome ism where you are trying to

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,030
Google a bug you're not finding it it's

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,040
really challenging and you're at the

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,110
point where you may get to the valley of

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,540
despair where you want to quit and throw

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,870
your computer out the window and not do

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,000
this

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,620
more and then you get to informed

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,900
optimism when you actually solve that

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,480
bug or you get to the end of your app

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,180
and then you get to the point of success

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,920
and fulfillment where it's awesome again

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,180
and programming so much fun and now you

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,080
get to learn the new JavaScript

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,550
framework so this emotional cycle of

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,070
change is something that people go

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,390
through all the time but just telling

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,339
them that they're going to go through

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,839
this is part of the battle so letting

00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,920
them know that it's going to be hard

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,230
that you're going to go through these

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,870
cycles is a huge part of learning in

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,880
itself people want to see this linear

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,740
trajectory if they start at nothing and

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,839
then keep moving up incrementally from

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,760
there but it's more of a cycle and it's

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:39,250
not just this one cycle it's more like

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,020
this so again the biggest thing you can

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,940
instill in a student is teaching them to

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,980
teach themselves because I can't teach

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,290
everybody every single thing that they

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,820
need to know and said I need to give

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,100
them the toolkit that they can use

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,260
themselves in order to teach themselves

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,700
things in the future not scalable for me

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,100
to teach them every single new thing

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,510
that comes out or every single method in

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,520
a library that they need to know that's

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,220
what the documentation is for you need

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,589
to teach them to use those tools that

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,209
you also use to program in order to

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,040
teach themselves and further their own

00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,250
knowledge so that's one of the biggest

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,330
things that you can do as a teacher

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,250
you're also trying to build a classroom

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,290
culture where every single person can

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,330
contribute so everybody feels safe to

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:24,940
learn in their own way there's so many

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,800
things that you can do for this even

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,600
just doing icebreakers on day one so

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,390
everybody knows each other is a huge

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,520
part of the journey but from there

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,800
making it so that no person is

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,900
dominating the conversation and no

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,240
person is completely left out of it as

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,700
well facilitating everybody being part

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,010
of the conversation making it so that

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,279
people from diverse backgrounds can all

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,770
contribute you're also trying to instill

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,560
confidence in them I've seen so many

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,000
people who are taken down out of this

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,029
industry because of imposter syndrome

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,279
myself included at parts of my career

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,990
and so instilling that confidence in

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,360
them letting them know that all of this

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,529
is normal and that they're doing cool

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,039
things is a huge part of the process

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:13,579
and the winds are going to happen and

00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,679
celebrate them when they do I after

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:18,619
every single project that my students do

00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,419
I have a retrospective the first part of

00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,679
the retrospective they talk about the

00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,179
things that they struggled with the

00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,889
things that are so problem areas for

00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,969
them the things that they still want to

00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:31,369
contribute to their projects afterwards

00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:32,749
fun things that they learned during the

00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,789
project that we didn't teach in class

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:36,529
and then the last part is just their

00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,909
accomplishments so everybody gets to

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,399
come in and say things that they

00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:42,549
accomplished during that project got to

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,239
celebrate all the high parts in order to

00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:49,279
overcome those low parts so now that

00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,559
we've talked about the mindset and what

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,439
goes into coaching people to actually

00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,389
learn we're now gonna talk about the

00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,459
actual mechanics of a lesson so what

00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,669
does a lesson plan look like how do you

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,379
break these things down so the first

00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,909
part is learning objectives my first

00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,459
slide for this talk was what you're

00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,899
going to be learning in this talk I told

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,449
you the different header slides that I'm

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,249
using and then the lesson this is

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:15,349
something that really helps students as

00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:17,059
well especially adult learners adult

00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,499
learners always want to know what comes

00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,079
next and what they're gonna actually

00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,579
accomplish and so warming them up and

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,509
telling them that at the very beginning

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:28,970
of the lesson goes a huge way it also

00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:31,039
makes it so that you get less off based

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,470
questions so that people aren't trying

00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,149
to ask you eight steps ahead of where

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,970
you're actually at they're just asking

00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,220
you where you're at the next part is

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,439
framing why should they care about this

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,879
piece of information why do they need to

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,769
know react why does it make it better

00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,229
why does it make developer processes

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,999
easier than vanilla JavaScript why do

00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:52,099
they need a database why are everything

00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:55,039
that we're learning so important why

00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:57,079
will they use it in the industry and why

00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,999
do they need to learn it knowing that

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,549
why behind it is a huge part of the

00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,739
process and just letting them know that

00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:06,799
these things are actually important goes

00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:09,709
a huge way and then it comes the actual

00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,139
lesson itself I structure my lessons in

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,779
this way so I do is more of a

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:17,629
traditional lecture type format where

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm telling people about this thing then

00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:22,900
we do that we do this is a code along

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,430
so every I am writing code in front of

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,590
the classroom and everybody is also

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,570
typing it on their own machines then

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:32,500
typing it along with me makes it cement

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,660
in their mind and so that's definitely a

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,850
pretty important step and then group

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,890
activities so if somebody didn't fully

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,290
understand something in the first part

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,140
then they can teach each other in those

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,540
group does group those groups and the

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,050
stronger students get their chance to

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,510
excel and to teach something to the

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,000
other classmates and then the last part

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,680
is you do which is individual work that

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,210
can come in the form of homework so

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,279
instead of having to have all of these

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:06,490
always within the actual lesson itself

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:08,440
it is distributed that way so this is

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,720
the format that I follow from my lessons

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,100
over and over and over again so each one

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,020
of these sections will be roughly ten

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,000
minutes and those repeat throughout the

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,440
lesson hands-on practice it's impossible

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,230
to learn something without actually

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,790
applying it so that's why I normally try

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,410
to do workshops instead of toxic

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,240
conferences because people learn better

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,620
in that format where they're actually

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,270
applying what they're knowit they're

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,800
learning they're writing the code

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,970
themselves they're extending their

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,370
knowledge in that way

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,680
and they're actually applying what

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,360
they're doing so hands-on practice

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,430
writing the code themselves not just

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,550
theoretically talking about what each

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:50,290
piece is is a huge part of the process

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,460
and then checks for understanding so you

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,620
can just look out into the crowd

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,730
sometimes and know okay that person's

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,290
lost that person's lost but actually

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,940
making it so that you know for sure

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,280
whether people are understanding it or

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,560
not is big as well so this can come in

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,360
the format of doing like mini pop

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,510
quizzes that are ungraded throughout the

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,310
class I sometimes ask questions and have

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,630
people write it on the whiteboard tables

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,339
in front of them slack pulls just asking

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,600
informal questions to the class so that

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,010
you're actually checking to make sure

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,680
that the students that need to

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:29,550
understand this are and then it comes

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,740
all my teaching advice

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,990
so the first part is to know your

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,290
audience so who are you actually

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:41,460
speaking to what are they trying to

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,440
learn if you are teaching a bunch of

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,550
brand-new beginners and you're using a

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,210
bunch of jargon that they don't

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,620
understand it's not gonna work well it's

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,080
gonna go over their heads they're not

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,850
gonna learn it but if you're teaching

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
industry experts about something and

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,360
you're explaining to them what a

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,490
variable is they're gonna tune out

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,800
because they think that that information

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,290
is not tailored for them so know your

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,690
audience know who you're talking to know

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,730
where they're at

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,230
set clear expectations what are people

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,030
trying to learn what is actually

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,220
important from this lesson what's bonus

00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,560
what are the clear things that they need

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,630
to take away and if you're doing things

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,130
like grading what are you going to be

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,750
looking at when you're grading something

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,250
what are the steps that they need to do

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,980
what are the questions that they need to

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,320
answer and also setting clear

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,000
expectations with students of only ask

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,100
questions during these amounts of times

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,200
don't just interrupt me when you're what

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,540
I'm speaking or don't speak over other

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,550
students or all of those classroom

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,080
culture things that make it more

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,810
productive for everybody to contribute

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,240
that's all important to set up front as

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,280
expectations I have my students do a

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,060
classroom Constitution on the first day

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,740
where they create their own rules for

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,810
the classroom that's not coming from me

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,160
that's coming from them they all have to

00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,630
stick to it because they all came up

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,330
with it themselves you're also having to

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,530
create a safe place to fail so this is

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,390
what I didn't have in my computer

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,280
science classroom I was pulling

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,980
all-nighters to try to just get things

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,220
done or get through the basics of things

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,950
and there wasn't a place where you could

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,810
go down the wrong path and make up for

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,640
that that's part of a development

00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,440
especially when you're learning when

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
you're brand new at learning you may go

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,280
down totally the wrong path with your

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,440
when you're in an assignment and it's

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,500
really hard to correct course and so

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,970
making that a part of your curriculum or

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,490
your learning path is so important so I

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:42,180
do things like having makeup assignments

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,100
if people miss things also making it so

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,049
that

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:50,250
there are places to make up anything

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:51,659
that they miss winking is one of the

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,690
most important things that I took away

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,130
from studying education in college so

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,279
linking is when you take something that

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,350
somebody already knows and then teach

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,330
them something new but in context of

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,940
what they already know teaching

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,460
something new in complete isolation when

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,340
they have no idea what's going on at all

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,770
is nearly impossible to learn we don't

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,510
learn that way so if I told you that a

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,419
variable is a bin for information you

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,960
had no idea what a variable was that

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,360
wouldn't really help anything but if I

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,460
instead linked it to algebra costs and I

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,010
said that in algebra class you had this

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,500
thing X and it was set to 1 or whatever

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,600
and you've seen this before that makes

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,860
it so much more powerful and makes it so

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,510
that they understand something in

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,760
context of what they already know there

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,000
are also going to be a lot of different

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,350
learning styles in your classroom or if

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,549
you're mentoring somebody they may have

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,059
a different learning style than other

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:52,890
people so I for example people always

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,190
ask me what my favorite video courses

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,500
are and I say that's a trick question

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,899
I don't like video courses I don't learn

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,120
well from them at all I learn well from

00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:05,059
reading I learn well from documentation

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,470
and so that's where I go to learn

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,960
everybody has a different learning style

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,090
and so some people like visual diagrams

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,950
other people like actually applying what

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,130
they learn some people need to have more

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,390
context behind what they're learning

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,640
everybody learns slightly differently

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:25,740
and so try to hit multiple learning

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,809
styles when you're teaching in addition

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,340
to that the nice thing about teaching to

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,750
multiple learning styles is that you can

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,580
essentially teach the same information

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,190
over and over again in different ways

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,500
and so that's a Belgian way of reviewing

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,299
things and they don't even realize it so

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,309
you show them a video on something then

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,169
you teach it themselves yourself and

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:46,590
then you have them apply it and that's

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:48,000
the same context content three times but

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,960
in three totally different ways and

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,690
nobody realizes it use the best

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,100
practices yourself usually if you're

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,630
teaching something you know it pretty

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,030
well

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,220
use those best practices that you know

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,140
so use clear variable names write clean

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,350
code follow all those best practices

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,860
don't use foo bar Baz nobody knows what

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,080
that means

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,160
use the best practices that you would

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,870
use in the wild it'll be more relevant

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,490
but it'll also be more understandable

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,110
those are the best practices for a

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:26,390
reason and again you can go over

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:28,460
information multiple times use

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,380
real-world examples so if you did

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,810
something at work at some point in your

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,660
career use that as an example in your

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,520
classroom so instead of just telling

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,850
them hypothetically this is what other

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,190
people do instead my team uses react and

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,650
this is why it's important this is what

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,080
problem that helped me solve all of

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,440
those types of stories make it so that

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,300
people care about it they think it's

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,980
important but it also makes it so that

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,810
it fits in the context of what they're

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,630
going to be doing in the future so use

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:07,460
those real-world examples in order to

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:10,640
engage students and mirror the career

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,280
world in your classroom so some things

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,350
that I do are I have stand-ups for my

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,730
students daily so they have to say what

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,540
they're doing there are highs and lows

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,470
and all of that

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:23,060
similar to stand-up in the real world

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,120
they submit pull requests for their

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,190
homework assignments so instead of just

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,870
submitting a Google Doc or something

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,870
like that they're making pull requests

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:35,210
and getting that practice in for some

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,580
projects I made them submit issues on

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,010
github instead of just directly asking

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,510
me questions all of these things mirror

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,520
what they would be doing in the future

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,680
and so I'm teaching them all of those

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,070
industry best practices even though

00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,530
they're focusing on something else there

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,990
I've even had friends think about using

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,490
JIRA for class and I'm not really sure

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,150
how that would work or how I feel about

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,000
it but it's an idea it's out there but

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,180
also make it fun sometimes so being in a

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,220
classroom for a long amount of time is

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,890
draining and cannot be super fun

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,429
sometimes and so I like to use things

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,799
that

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,539
are fun and engage students so if I

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,549
notice that students are really dragging

00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,590
one day I usually have them build a

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,179
Britney Spears fangirl app because

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,580
people think that's funny and makes it

00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:25,929
so that it's a lot more engaging for

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,119
learners also there's dad jokes API

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:31,460
super fun and also something that

00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:36,259
mirrors the real world like and using an

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,720
API for anything is awesome you're also

00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:44,119
trying to teach the why and the how so

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,799
the mechanics the context but also why

00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,659
you're using this why you're doing this

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,299
a certain way why this best practice

00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:52,039
matters all of that is important to not

00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,869
just the syntax if I was just teaching

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,669
people this is how you set a variable in

00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,350
JavaScript that doesn't make any sense

00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,090
that doesn't help anybody but if I teach

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,679
them why they need it that's so much

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,879
more important I've made it so that

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,740
occasionally I will just give students

00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,749
cheat sheets for things because the

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,399
syntax is not the most important thing

00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:12,049
they have a text editor they have error

00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:14,090
messages to let them know about syntax

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:16,879
issues and sure it's important to know

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,590
but the why is what transfers from

00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,179
language to language from framework to

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,409
framework all of those things are

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:26,659
important as well another thing that I

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:29,809
see a lot especially with engineers

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:33,830
moving on to teaching is that they teach

00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:36,679
everything that they know not what's

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,110
necessary and not for the students it's

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:45,110
for their own ego so I was recently

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:47,659
reviewing a lesson where when they were

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,389
teaching variables in Python it talked

00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,860
all about the underlying C code that was

00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,779
written in order to make it so that you

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,409
could make a variable in Python great

00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:58,970
information awesome not something that

00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:00,440
they need to know at that point and not

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,019
something that makes understanding what

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,220
a variable is more easy and so make sure

00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,619
that what you're teaching them is

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,539
actually necessary and actually makes it

00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,490
so that they are learning something new

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,710
not just because it's a thing that you

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,409
know facts or awesome fun facts are

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,960
great but scale it back to what they

00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:21,399
actually need to know teach the pool or

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,399
not the ocean

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:28,540
people's attention spans are 11 to 13

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,990
minutes long I won't say this again

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,700
people's attention spans are 11 to 13

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,740
minutes long that's something that I've

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,360
been loving about these keynotes is that

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,410
they're 15 minutes they keep people

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,960
engaged longer sessions are harder for

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:47,050
people to stay focused in and so that's

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,720
why I rotate through that I do we do you

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,910
all do you do because those can be

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,410
broken into those 11 to 13 minute

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,630
segments they keep everybody engaged

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,730
that's one of my biggest problems with

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,160
computer science education is that a lot

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,570
are in lecture halls with a bunch of

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,790
people and it's just somebody talking

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,680
for two hours and people don't really

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,200
learn well in that because they're not

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,530
engaging with material and it goes on

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,330
for a lot longer than 11 to 13 minutes

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:18,910
so sorry you all that this is way longer

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:21,100
than your attention spans you're also

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:24,430
going to be trying to teach mostly to

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,680
the middle most of the students are

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,290
going to fall into the middle of the

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,180
class as far as skill level goes so

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,550
you're tailoring your lessons mostly to

00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,170
them they're going to be outliers that

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,060
how that's how it works they're going to

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,980
be people that really struggle with

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,440
material and that's gonna be different

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,240
people at different parts of it they're

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,550
also going to be incredibly strong

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,560
people as well who came in with prior

00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,500
knowledge or coding just clicks for them

00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,090
and so those are the people that you

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,340
spend your one-on-one attention on

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,750
instead of that classroom lecture where

00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,090
you're trying to get everybody so you

00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:01,960
have your TAS focus on those people you

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,640
have tiered activities which means that

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,560
instead of just having one assignment

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,540
that everybody's doing you have a basic

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,090
assignment that everybody should work on

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,620
but once they finish those there are

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,740
bonus activities so they can keep

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,030
extending their knowledge and can keep

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,240
challenging themselves as that if that's

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,940
something that they need tangents

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,750
usually confuse people so I have a lot

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,940
of amazing teacher friends who are super

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,820
prone to tangents and they're still

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,920
awesome teachers but it's going to be a

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,740
lot more helpful to stay on topic

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,330
stay on the lesson plan tailor into

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,180
those learning objectives make sure

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,650
you're coming back to those instead of

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,000
going off on different tangents and

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,770
telling all these different random

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,060
stories that probably won't actually

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:52,220
help people said this before but break

00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,350
down jargon don't use a bunch of words

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,720
that don't mean anything to people it's

00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,390
gonna be really confusing but you also

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,280
do need to actually use that jargon in

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,320
your lessons because they're going to be

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,390
needing to understand that in the jobs

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,490
and interviews so you need to

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,230
incorporate that jargon but also explain

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,760
it and not just to explain it the first

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,770
time but explain it maybe the first

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,500
three times so the first three times you

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:21,100
talk about what a component is you tell

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:25,010
them what a component is take breaks so

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:27,620
within those lessons I try to make it so

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,140
that out of every hour roughly 10

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,350
minutes our breaks walking away from

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,150
things is an incredible part of the

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,390
learning process and super super

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,970
important so that people can come back

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,350
to concepts there is this incredible

00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,210
course on Coursera that I could

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,240
recommend to anybody called learning how

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,490
to learn and this course goes into the

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,500
whole science behind how people actually

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:56,330
learn so one of the biggest things is

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,490
that brains make connections when

00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,990
they're resting so if you are just

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,610
working really really really hard all

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,410
the time your brain isn't going to be

00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,600
able to link those concepts together and

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:09,260
make those connections that make it so

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,790
that learning is actually possible so I

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,920
think people think the idea of taking

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,110
breaks is this fluffy idea that's

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,100
awesome in theory but doesn't actually

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:21,470
help them know it's brain science and

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,180
then also coming back to concepts so not

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,710
just teaching things once but teaching

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,080
at multiple times and coming back to

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,650
those things and reviewing them spaced

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,970
repetition is the best way to learn you

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,860
also want to make it so that teacher

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,330
that students can teach each other so I

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,430
talked about doing group work and

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,770
pairing students in groups that they

00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,630
will be successful so putting people in

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,340
those groups that will be able to mentor

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,960
the people who are a little bit more

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,960
challenged with the material or

00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,540
distributing work in that way also

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,640
enabling the students who are really

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,710
really excelling and who are maybe less

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,210
challenged by the material itself to

00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,890
teach those other people because

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,660
teaching is one of the best ways to

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,490
learn like I said at the beginning of

00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,140
this presentation and so incorporate

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,660
that for your students as well I

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,340
sometimes have lessons where I turn it

00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,040
completely over to the students and give

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,750
them all an act or a topic to teach

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,420
themselves and they do like lightning

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,480
talks on something and so that's a

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,340
really effective way of a making things

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,240
more interesting but be allowing teach

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,680
students to teach as well I also follow

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,020
this idea of gradual release of

00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,440
responsibility so at the beginning of a

00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,180
class I am much more there to answer

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,580
every single question and help them out

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,340
with their bugs and all that but at the

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,590
end of the 12 weeks not there that much

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,940
anymore because after those 12 weeks I

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:49,090
don't exist I do but in theory I don't

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,580
so there's this gradual release of

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,470
responsibility where over time I change

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,480
my learn my teaching style and my

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,640
activities so that it's more on the

00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,110
students rather than on me I'm helping

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,230
them less on every single question that

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:06,360
they have so that they are more and more

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,360
prepared to take this on themselves

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:16,120
another one of my big soap boxes is to

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,200
not rely too much on memorization I see

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,710
a lot of people when they're starting

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,180
out at code who want to memorize the API

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,710
so essentially they want to memorize

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,230
every single method they'll make

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,690
flashcards this method does this this

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,660
method does that but these things change

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,000
and you may be using a different

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,650
framework and that's something else it's

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,750
much more important to be able to find

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,270
that answer to use your googling skills

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,070
or to understand the concepts behind

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,350
something why does an array have a

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,420
length in the first place those concepts

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,330
are so much more important than any

00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,730
piece of syntax any single API that you

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:55,900
could memorize so this is something that

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,330
I emphasize all the time for my students

00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,750
and a lot of them for example I just

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,430
finished teaching my C

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,890
express and if you've ever built and

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,440
expressed that you have to plug in all

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,540
these sorts of things and write tons of

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,570
code in order to actually get an express

00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:14,120
app running and then one of my students

00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,710
asked me how to actually memorize this

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,180
and how to actually remember it and I

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,250
was like you don't need to this is

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,960
hundred steps that I'm telling you to do

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,640
you don't have to have every single one

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,940
of these memorized I don't know how to

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,350
do all of these I scratch from zero I

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,240
would still have issues to you so

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:33,460
memorization isn't the important part

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,800
instead understanding the concepts is

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,600
allow students to ask questions so that

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,550
they can clarify their understanding and

00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,660
that they can extend their knowledge if

00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,810
they're interested in something

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,670
additional that being said sometimes

00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,620
you'll get questions that are really at

00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,580
a left field and not super relevant to

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,610
what you're talking about

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,680
and so I do the idea of a parking lot

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,900
where it's like this is a great question

00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,640
but maybe is not super relevant to the

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,160
class as a whole so ask me in a

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:06,530
one-on-one basis or we can come back to

00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,690
it on a later lesson and teach them that

00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,410
it's okay to not know something I don't

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:14,300
know everything

00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:17,150
at all nobody does that's impossible so

00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,200
that's okay as a teacher you may feel

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,450
this pressure to know absolutely

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,370
everything but it's okay to say I don't

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,110
know let's look that up together let's

00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,280
learn it together because that's

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,590
something that they're going to have to

00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,140
go through as well and being able to

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,030
acknowledge that as a person goes a long

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,530
way and is something that they will have

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:40,370
to do as well and then the last piece is

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:42,050
reviewing at the end again teaching

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,990
things multiple times is important so

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,180
that's what I'm gonna do right now so

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,460
again you've probably already teach in

00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,560
some way in your life and having

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,970
teaching skills will help you to do that

00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:58,040
better giving people the mindset the

00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,600
growth mindset that learning is really

00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,750
awesome that they don't have to know

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,550
everything that it's going to be hard

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,070
sometimes is a huge part of the battle

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,070
and you have to prepare them for that I

00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,460
structure lessons in the following way I

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,090
have my learning objectives

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,059
I have my framing the why why is this

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:23,630
important I structure all the lectures

00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:28,640
in I do which is a lecture we do where

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:32,960
we code together you do and you all do

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,640
which are activities for them to do make

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,159
sure that they have breaks because they

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,080
need to be focused and people's

00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,929
attentions short spans are short and

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,610
then also at a review at the end I

00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:46,820
usually do this in questions an

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,649
electric-type format and then I had a

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,330
bunch of advice for you all it's all on

00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:52,970
