Title: Va Barbosa - Deep Learning at the Edge with TensorFlow.js
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	With TensorFlow.js developers can embed pre-trained deep learning models directly within a Node.js or web application. Deep learning can be used for many tasks including image or audio classification, facial recognition, object recognition, image caption generation, and natural language processing. TensorFlow.js enables inferencing on deep learning models at the edge, removing the dependency on potentially slow and unreliable network API calls. Weâ€™ll explore the opportunities and the challenges around deploying pre-trained deep learning models to edge environments.
