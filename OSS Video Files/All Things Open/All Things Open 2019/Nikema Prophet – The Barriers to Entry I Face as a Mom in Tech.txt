Title: Nikema Prophet – The Barriers to Entry I Face as a Mom in Tech
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	How do you count the people who couldn’t be in the room because they’ve been shut out? In this session you’ll learn the structural barriers low-income parents face as they attempt to break into tech. We will cover the awareness gaps that lead to the conditions that effectively shut out a population that has much to contribute.

In this talk, Nikema gives examples from her lived experiences of how diversity and inclusion efforts repeatedly miss the mark. She offers suggestions to event organizers and community leaders on ways beyond scholarships to create acce

hi there I'm really really glad that

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,719
we're getting to do this for another

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,980
year at last year Todd didn't tell you

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,359
but last year they were very nervous

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,930
about how this was going to turn out

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,660
whether or not it was going to fly and

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,760
it flew pretty well so I was very very

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,710
pleased that he asked me to do this

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,269
again and in the interest of time I'm

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,850
not going to say too much right now cuz

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,540
you're gonna hear my voice a lot so I am

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,850
going to bring up nickimja prophet to

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,120
the stage she'll be your first speaker

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,149
and could I ask that nabi s Silk'n could

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,350
go to the tech desk so that she'll be

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,420
properly prepared

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,890
are you hearing Nadia Navi yeah yeah

00:00:48,420 --> 00:01:03,359
great go talk to them

00:00:49,890 --> 00:01:10,880
okay nickimja there you go okay hi this

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,880
is my first all things open and think oh

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:30,140
okay is this my clicker it is okay sorry

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:36,530
um so I'm nickimja I am a parent a

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,530
founder an artist a software developer

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:48,500
but if I add more details I'm a single

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,970
low-income disabled homeschooling mom

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,970
I'm a black woman founder

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:16,890
I'm a 36 year old entry-level software

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:19,860
developer with zero degrees oh okay so

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,860
I'm basically a unicorn in text basis

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,230
and all these intersecting identities

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:32,310
add up to a rich and broad body of lived

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:37,590
experiences and I can relate to everyone

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,840
in this room on a human level but I can

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,890
also relate to those of you who stayed

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,200
up all night with a sick child or had to

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,630
put items back in the grocery store

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,819
checkout because you can't afford all

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:57,870
the food that you wanted I can relate to

00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:01,049
those of you who have given birth and I

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,660
can relate to reaching adulthood before

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:07,320
seeing a mandate that was in my skin

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,360
color I can relate to being too

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,820
depressed to get out of bed and brush my

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:21,620
teeth and shower so in preparing for

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,620
this talk I realized what a gift that is

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:29,760
so I'm taking the next few minutes very

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,900
seriously because for as many of you who

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:39,390
I can relate to in this room there are

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,310
many more who couldn't be here and we

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,900
are all missing out on their

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:53,700
perspectives so this talk is in honor of

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:55,859
us so why does it matter this whole list

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,319
of identities that I just ran through

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,410
why does it matter why we're

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,900
technologists so why can't we just focus

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,620
on the tech let our work speak for

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,319
itself without the labels it matters

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,229
because technologists our future shapers

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:21,780
and you know who else our future shavers

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:25,289
parents but not just parents the people

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,550
who represent the global majority across

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:32,460
the demographics yet are severely

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,840
underrepresented in tech in the tech

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,570
ecosystem we are all future shapers and

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,850
the technology and software that we're

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:48,720
developing has a potential to reach

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:51,570
billions of people and that tech can

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:58,770
mean and does mean life or death for

00:04:51,570 --> 00:05:05,340
people so we have a responsibility as a

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:09,539
community to gather and apply as many

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,270
diverse perspectives as we can to

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,470
developing technology this needs

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,150
improvement and we need to do better

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,389
each of us have privileges that lead to

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:25,380
awareness gaps and that's not a moral

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:27,659
judgment on anyone it's a fact and I'm

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:32,280
going to use the remaining minutes to

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:38,909
talk about how tech could have been more

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:41,220
inclusive for me over the years so the

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,199
first and it kind of applies to this

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:50,909
situation right now

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:58,260
free admission does not mean access I am

00:05:50,909 --> 00:06:02,430
unless if you think oh I said that out

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,620
loud if you really want to be inclusive

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,330
of those of us who are breaking into

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,860
tech from a lower socioeconomic class

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,780
you have to go farther than offering a

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:18,659
free ticket because as someone who lives

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,840
life in the red like my bank account is

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:26,340
negative more often than not

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,669
free attendance still means attending a

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:35,240
conference is at best a financial

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:39,240
hardship and is honestly pretty

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,070
irresponsible of me realistically if

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,550
you're offering if you're only offering

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:50,220
free admission or scholarships people

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,550
can't afford to come they stay home and

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,630
we lose that perspective in the room so

00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,210
if you're preparing scholarships offers

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,940
you want to diversify your attendees

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,520
please think about the expense of travel

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,370
food accommodations missed work

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,620
childcare think about the fact that

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,750
people may not have access to a credit

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,510
card and that matters when you're

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,850
checking into a hotel and I have a

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:24,150
personal story my first tech conference

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:26,280
I was able to get a hotel luckily I was

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,930
close enough to drive but I was able to

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,020
get a hotel and I couldn't check in

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:36,979
because my bank account was negative as

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,979
usual and I don't have a credit card so

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,500
yeah those are things that may not be

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,220
obvious but keep people out of these

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,610
spaces and a free ticket doesn't create

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:54,450
access to these spaces when there are so

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,120
many secondary costs to attending and I

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,970
couldn't afford to come here it was a

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:07,340
community effort that included

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:07,340
sponsorship and individual donations so

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:16,620
let's stop there I would like to talk

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,600
about how the by now pay later income

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,780
share agreement model that's being

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,600
popularized by coding boot camps isn't

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,340
really a great path into tech but we

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,340
don't have time for that ask me after

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:41,450
okay recognize our differences so if you

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:46,070
want to include me and your usual crowd

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:50,380
is typically very white or male just

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:56,150
know that we don't swap out one for one

00:08:50,380 --> 00:09:00,710
and I would like to see us respecting

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:04,130
and valuing our differences just think

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,250
if the scorecard only includes traits

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,970
that you never have and never will

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,390
possess are we surprised when

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:19,400
minoritized people feel like imposters

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:21,500
like we don't belong it's because or

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,190
that we don't measure up it's because we

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,560
don't we don't measure up by the

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,570
standards and that's because you're

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,080
failing to measure a lot of things that

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,840
make us great for example it takes a lot

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,330
of skill to be a parent successfully

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,970
even if that just means keeping your

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,640
kids alive and fed it takes skill to do

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,760
that takes skills to connect to others

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,290
with empathy and compassion it takes

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,580
skill to make $20 stretch for a week but

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,620
those are things that you don't really

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,980
see on the surface and don't typically

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,200
go on a resume and it's okay to

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,970
recognize differences because if you

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,970
don't see them you don't really see me

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:19,790
explicitly welcome us I attended an

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:22,910
event early after when I was founding my

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,690
company and it was a life-changing event

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,960
and I met people who are amazing and I

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,820
still talk to you today and I would not

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,120
have gone to this event if I had not

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,040
seen a tweet that explicitly asked for

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,520
black and brown women to attend

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,420
so this is one small thing that you can

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,190
do if you're organizing for the people

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,230
who can make it over the financial

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:53,490
hurdle hurdle to know that they're

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:59,040
welcome like ask for us let us know that

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,890
we're welcome so yeah

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,660
speaking as a single mom every event

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,460
that I go to comes at a cost and

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,320
[Music]

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,740
disappointment is an understatement when

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,930
I take the time to attend these events

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,210
and I'm not represented not only in the

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:26,360
attendees but the speakers and presented

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:28,800
presenters so welcome bust but also

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:36,570
don't welcome us if you're not going to

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:39,810
represent us okay ask us for help ask us

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,160
for help and pay us to do it if you want

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:47,810
diversity equity and inclusion you want

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:50,520
more of a specific community to show up

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,610
find the leaders in those communities

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:58,290
and ask them who should be there who

00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:02,520
needs to be in the room because we know

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:05,520
each other and we're brilliant and just

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,300
because you don't see us I mean it's

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:13,680
very trivial I could come up with a list

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:18,080
of 100 underrepresented brilliant people

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,080
right now easily

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,700
there's just no shortage of brilliant

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,700
people in every marginalized community

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:39,700
so yeah that I did I go over yes so I

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,830
guess I am done and I'm on Twitter like

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,400
every day so you want to talk to me find

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,290
me there

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,419
thank you

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,419
