[Music]

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,009
I'm Tom Schneider I lead the ride

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,109
organization and I think our slides will

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,720
be coming up here in a moment we have

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,789
just two quick lightning talks for you

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,150
today focus in augmented and virtual

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,720
reality and about an hour ago I got a

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,510
note letting me know that lenovo is

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,340
releasing what they call the a6 which is

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,920
this VR

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,620
I'm sorry augmented reality headset that

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,690
I'm wearing and this has there's only

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,550
about a hundred of these that are in

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,930
production so far it's a new product

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,719
that's rolling out so I have to be

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,980
really careful I don't break it I don't

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,890
know one of the first things that you

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,539
learn when you when you were told about

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,309
public speaking is if you're nervous you

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,960
should picture the audience naked we

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,260
maybe have the technology for that but I

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,750
don't think that's probably a good idea

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,120
so we'll see where this goes I'm not

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,970
gonna run a demo on this now but at our

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,310
demo night which is starts in about 30

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,610
minutes downstairs you'll be able to go

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,400
to to the SAS booth SAS has been working

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,100
with Lenovo on this project and and C

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,400
you know put this on and see in real

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,860
time some really cool demos of this cool

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,049
technology so with that I'm gonna

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,430
introduce dr. Sarah Globa my friend and

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,770
colleague to talk a little bit about

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,750
what riot does just in case anyone

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,150
hasn't heard of riot so quick show of

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,220
hands who has heard of riot before thank

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
you so much to the Riot community for

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,290
being here for this event just quickly

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,180
our mission as most of you know Todd

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,310
Lewis did a great job of plugging us

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,350
earlier we are the largest IOT

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,450
organization of our kind we're a

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,479
non-profit so that means we're focused

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,729
on capturing creating catalyzing IOT

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,770
opportunities that do good things for

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,619
the ecosystem as a whole now a big part

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,189
of that for us is establishing this area

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,270
as a global center of excellence for IOT

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,490
but we also want to help organizations

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,079
that aren't in this area to plug in to

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,789
what's going on here so riot is a big

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,920
convener in that how do we measure

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,420
success well here's some metrics that

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,260
you can look at so we know that we've

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,840
had over

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,879
thousand riders attend events just like

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,530
this one and that's not all from one

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,019
organization we did some research and

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,840
saw that over 1,200 different companies

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,159
were represented in that we also have

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,099
chapters we have one here in the

00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,480
Triangle obviously we've got Charlotte

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,620
we've got Atlanta and now we've got

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,980
Wilson when we measure arson all right

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,049
Wilson in the crowd when we measure our

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,940
success we look at jobs created and

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,890
investment in startups and we can see

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,120
the organizations working with Riot have

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,980
created over 500 jobs and raised over

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,079
350 million which is a pretty big deal

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,730
so we're feeling really good about that

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,069
but what we really want to emphasize

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,470
tonight is there are a lot of things

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,150
going on that you can plug into you're a

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,920
part of this movement you're a part of

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,269
this fourth Industrial Revolution so

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,540
we're gonna give you a sneak peek into

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:08,579
some of the things that riot is working

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,139
so the first I mentioned in the opening

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,409
remarks this morning for those that were

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:16,019
at the opening plenary we have been

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,049
really fortunate to have an incredibly

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,180
collaborative landscape across North

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,549
Carolina really across the southeast but

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,340
here in the Triangle we've worked very

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,720
closely with NC State University with a

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,090
number of municipal governments

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,250
including the City of Raleigh town and

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,190
Kerry and others industrial partners

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,790
research partners nonprofits like

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,340
ourselves over the last 18 months to

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,799
work towards what we announced just a

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,389
couple weeks ago a 24 million dollar

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,449
investment by the National Science

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,269
Foundation in an advanced wireless

00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:54,569
network for drone research so this is a

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,900
huge deal this essentially makes this

00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:00,060
region the center of excellence for

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,879
anything in autonomous aerial vehicles

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,709
we already have incredible companies

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,870
like precisionhawk the CEO of precision

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,060
Hawk if you hadn't heard is now the

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,209
chair of the FAA Advisory Committee in

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,729
Washington DC to drone regulations and

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,680
standards we have this testbed where

00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,190
we'll be able to do interesting things

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,710
for example launch networks of drones

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,590
that then can provide wireless coverage

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,490
wherever they fly I think about bringing

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,919
connect

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,110
- disaster relief an emergency response

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,410
for example this will be an open

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,750
platform so that anyone around the world

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,569
that wants to run experiments on this

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,669
network can apply through an online

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:46,319
portal that'll be launched early next

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:48,479
year get that experiment approved get it

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,620
run locally for you if you need that if

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,240
you're somewhere else in the world where

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,710
you can travel here and do that and then

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,900
the work and the research that comes on

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,520
comes out of this platform will be

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,949
shared openly for other researchers and

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,659
in other advances so this is a really

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,099
exciting opportunity the wireless

00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,800
Research Center which is the other half

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:07,409
a riot is going to be building and

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,630
running and maintaining the network over

00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:11,520
the next five years and we hope you know

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,389
to carry it on from there it's a huge

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,740
achievement for the area great and I'm

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,270
gonna talk about another initiative we

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,319
have going on does anybody live in an

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,229
area that is prone to hurricanes a

00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,360
couple people so stormwater is a huge

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,919
problem in a lot of areas it's a big

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,659
problem here because we have things like

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,310
hurricanes that bring all this water all

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,530
the sudden what's interesting about

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,389
stormwater is if you click data about

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,090
stormwater usually do that within a city

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:41,729
when that stormwater crosses over a city

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,639
line it actually doesn't care that it

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,500
did that so what's happening is we need

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,479
a more regional approach to stormwater

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,680
data we need to be able to share so that

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,780
when storm on our leaves one

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,460
municipality and goes to another we have

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,380
a broader understanding of where it's

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,880
going how quickly can help the state to

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,500
be better prepared but there's

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,810
challenges with regional approaches like

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,960
that who owns the data who's gonna keep

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,419
it secure and so riot as a nonprofit as

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,400
a neutral organization is able to do

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,719
unique things like build a table where

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,819
different municipalities can come

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,620
together and discuss that very issue and

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,719
I'm excited to tell you that it's

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,060
happening so we have organized we have

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,599
people represented from Raleigh from

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,460
Kerry from we have Wolfson we've got

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,979
people from Holly Springs Morrisville

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,840
Wake County North Carolina Emergency

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,240
Management coming together to talk about

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,250
this very issue now what does that mean

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,229
it means that riot is helping to build a

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,240
table build a platform where these kinds

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,370
of discussions can happen we're bringing

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,050
the expertise to that discussion but

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,970
also just the neutral perspective

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,680
of what are some ways forward it's

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,449
probably not likely that we can get a

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,970
bunch of different cities to agree to

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,770
purchase the exact same technology exact

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,330
same sensors exact same cloud

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,979
subscription and so what are some

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,629
alternatives and riot is helping to

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,789
build that so wanted you to know that

00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:58,919
that's going on we've already had some

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,780
discussions at NC open pass at the Civic

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,729
Camp abet at the smart cities conference

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,960
that was in DC last week and we've got

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,909
more coming up we'll talk about a

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,830
triangle smart cities event coming up

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,509
but what did you know that's happening

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,520
if you have any interests and challenges

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,979
like that smart city challenges storm

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
water or otherwise connect with riot let

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,750
us know what you're interested in and

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,030
how we can help thanks sir I want to add

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,219
that she listed a whole bunch of places

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,349
that are involved in this project but

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,840
this is open to anyone so if your

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,969
municipality wasn't listed we encourage

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,639
you to reach out the goal is to create

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:35,580
an open architecture for data a common

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,259
framework and a legal structure around

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,449
how the data rights and data sharing

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,490
should be managed so anyone can opt in

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,490
there's no requirement to participate

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,560
but we want to make it really easy and

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,380
from this framework that first use case

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,509
of stormwater can then be expanded into

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,550
many many other areas to serve our

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,490
citizens better make our cities more

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,110
efficient and and better and happier
