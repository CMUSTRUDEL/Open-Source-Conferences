Description: 
	When building out workflows for your CI/CD pipeline(s), determining the overall health of your automated processes can be quite challenging. DevOps practitioners have learned to add logging analysis tools and a host of other solutions to address observability concerns. When Capital One started its CI/CD journey, we discovered that there weren’t any observability tools that met our needs. So like any open source endeavor, we built our own and then shared it: Hygieia (Link: http://hygieia.github.io/Hygieia/) Today, Hygieia is used by several companies around the world to better track their CI/CD pipelines. Many of these users also contribute code and documentation back to the project.

Hygieia is a single, configurable dashboard that visualizes the health of your entire software delivery pipeline. Hygieia is an Open Source project with an active community that has developed the following key features:

Team Dashboard — monitor things like work items, code repo, builds, quality items (unit tests, security, coverage, etc.) and deployments in one dashboard.
Configurable View — set up the dashboard to display the widgets that matter most to your project.
Real-time Status — monitor quality, productivity, and work in process on a real-time basis within the dashboard.
Executive Dashboard — access an aggregated view of key DevOps metrics.
Gamification — share performance feedback at the widget and team dashboard level by displaying a “star-rating”.
In this talk, we will demonstrate how a platform for observability can help your teams determine the effectiveness of your efforts to “automate all the things” in a CI/CD pipeline.
