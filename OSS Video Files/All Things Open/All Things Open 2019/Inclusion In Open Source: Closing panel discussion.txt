	00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,610
hi we're gonna get started and then the

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,670
people that are still still eating can

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,460
filter back in so what we hoping for now

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,869
is a continuation of the conversation we

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,300
were having right before we let you guys

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,180
all go out on break that was a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,619
compassionate bio break there that we

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,380
were trying to throw but it got a little

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,269
out of hand so about a half an hour of

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,949
conversation so hopefully you guys have

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,050
burning questions that you haven't asked

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,940
yet or that nobody else asked that

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,399
you're dying dying to hear somebody talk

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,469
about I see some guys see some hands up

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,489
do we have anybody willing to be runner

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:49,680
for four stick mic it looks like they're

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:55,410
in the back of the stick mics they have

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,090
to be able to talk to okay hands up

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,090
again for questions and we're gonna let

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:12,500
there's the first one in the center hi

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,500
how's it work he says keep talking I

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,880
think does it work yeah okay so first of

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,150
all thank you very much for organizing

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,340
the event was great and it definitely

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,250
showed different opinions and all the

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,850
concept of inclusiveness and open also

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,840
my mind about a lot of the diversities

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:45,750
and things that I may not consider in my

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,939
life right now and I have noticed that a

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,020
lot of the discussion has been on

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,930
putting the a lot of the effort on the

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,610
tech companies and how they can create

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,390
an environment in their office that is

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,860
more inclusiveness I wanted to take the

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,490
discussion a little bit from a different

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,619
side also it's like a lot of the tech

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,780
companies that when they come to the

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,500
point that they need to capitalize and

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,500
start making money

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,920
they have been creating artificial

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,690
intelligence in order to keep people

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,330
interested in the topic so that they can

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:31,140
advertise to them which means it has

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,480
created a shift in our population there

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,670
has gone very extremely to the left or

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,790
very extremely to the right and that is

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,989
actually to detriment of society because

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,510
it actually does create more extremism

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:52,260
especially for people that may not

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:56,670
relieve you inclusiveness as much as a

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:59,880
benefit and they just don't see the

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,530
other point of view so I wonder what is

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:08,069
your perspective for it and how can we

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:14,000
help and change the narrative from a tax

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:17,579
perspective in order to try and make

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,569
also everyone aware of the other side

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:23,280
more okay thank you for the question -

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,440
to restate I think he's talking about

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,410
the polarizing effect of chatbots and

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,319
how how could what can we do to

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,600
counterbalance that I will say I've been

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,760
concerned you know I'm old right I've

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,420
been concerned about the gradual erosion

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,549
of civil civic discourse we're having a

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,739
very hard time having conversations

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,350
because we're so polarized right now but

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,440
that's an effect that's being put upon

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,810
us to make us more to make it easier for

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,120
things to happen that we're not paying

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,410
attention to what I mean is if they if

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,560
they do something that makes the

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,530
polarized edges scream and cry because

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,810
it's so you know weird you have to

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,130
always watch like behind the curtain

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,329
what are they really doing that they

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,489
don't want you to pay attention to why

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,700
did they create this little tweet storm

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,200
about something stupid like cough FA you

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,239
know what was really happening back

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,950
there behind that Mis phallus is an

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,269
interesting question

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,810
you guys have anything to say about

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,289
chatbots and in polarization of civil

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,289
civic discourse

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:33,020
so what I would say is that it's it's a

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,539
good tactic like strategically speaking

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,150
because you're exploiting a weakness and

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,130
so if you want to bring something down

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,500
you look for its weaknesses and a

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,500
weakness that we have in our society is

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,060
the way that people communicate with

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:52,699
each other and racial divides are an

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,849
issue and so if you want to bring

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:58,069
something down you would work on putting

00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:59,780
a wedge into a weakness and cranking it

00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:06,710
open and that's how that's how you make

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:10,000
the cracks so I think that bots are

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,819
going to continue to be really effective

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,849
but the more that we work on reducing

00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:19,069
these weak points in our suit of armor

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,780
the less effective they're going to be

00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,909
so actually a lot of the

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,479
responsibilities the onus actually is on

00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:28,370
us and then as far as you also mentioned

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,949
artificial intelligence and machine

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,630
learning I used to be in the at la

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,340
immersion lab and we did a lot of work

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,389
with vision science and artificial

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,539
intelligence and the weaknesses there

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:45,349
stem certain weaknesses there is stem

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:47,750
from a lack of presence of people for

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,430
example we inadvertently produced

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,740
technology that couldn't see

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,610
dark-skinned people and it's because it

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,349
was calibrated

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,900
by a really wonderful lab member who is

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,560
white and was surrounded by white people

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,300
and just like the those original photo

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,969
cards that are calibrated to a white

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,960
complexion we did the same thing and

00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:14,659
then it was unusable by people of color

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,909
that could have very simply been avoided

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,639
had we had one dark-skinned person in

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:21,199
the lab at that time everybody cycles

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,229
through it's like whoa we can't see so

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,690
and so that person wasn't there and

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:29,319
that's how the technology developed and

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,319
the mic back to you

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,680
was that a good was that a good answer

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,780
can we move on

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:48,600
great next question it's a bunch of

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:49,200
hands here Claire there another one oh

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,850
sorry

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,260
all right yeah thank you so much for all

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,180
of you sharing your stories today it was

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,890
really impactful and especially getting

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,100
the variety of perspectives and being

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,700
able to see places where each of your

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,350
stories touch on some of sillier things

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,860
one of the things I kind of noticed was

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,920
this very quiet kind of like after the

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,280
sentence refrain of I doubted myself or

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,710
I asked is this really happening to me

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,730
even in the movie the woman who said

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,240
that

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,260
all right finding out that she the one

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,080
woman when she went to the bathroom

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,840
finding out they said well not you like

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,980
the other man or the woman who was

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,840
pregnant each of them said I didn't know

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,280
if I should like double down I didn't

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
know if I was being perceived wrong I

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,700
didn't know if there was something I had

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,410
done to invite this can you guys talk a

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,270
little bit about when do you double down

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,710
when do you reach out I know you talked

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,660
about community and how like having

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,420
people to support but how do you

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,620
identify when it's you that has actually

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,080
done something wrong or when it is

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,960
something that you have no control over

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,090
and just have to work around Thanks yeah

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,740
so I'm gonna briefly tell you a story

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,720
about a woman one of the founders of the

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,780
Grace Hopper conference named Barbara

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,690
Fox she's about 10 years older than I am

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,620
and when I met her she was doing all the

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:13,080
localizations for character sets that

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,840
were more than 26 characters and she was

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,570
doing it it was a hack around their wood

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,580
they were using an address space to make

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,310
that happen because Unicode didn't exist

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,850
yet so she had a small army of Japanese

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:29,130
kids in Palo Alto banging away on these

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,500
localizations she used to go to meetings

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,840
in Japan and she had a male assistant

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,370
who went with her and they in those

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,340
meetings they would talk to her male

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,560
assistant because he was male and he he

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,649
looked Asian and sometimes they would

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,009
stray into commentary about her

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,470
in Japanese and she'd wait until they

00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,819
got pretty far down the road of being

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,540
ugly and then she would whip out her

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:56,129
flawless japanese and thing that was

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,379
great about that at least in that

00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,089
society they would be so embarrassed

00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,519
they'd fall all over themselves to make

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,119
it better because in that culture

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,339
embarrassment is the worst thing that

00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:07,050
could happen and so she was using it to

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,730
that to business advantage but I always

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,689
thought it was such a gutsy thing to do

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,519
you know for my own self women get

00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:17,490
called out on the net how many people is

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,170
this news - yeah right

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,029
I personally been called out on the net

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,579
my whole career and I started early

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,249
answering every single time as a human

00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,899
being like wow what did I do to you that

00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:33,600
you think this is okay for you to say

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,360
about me you never even met me you know

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,999
and what I found is it's a lot harder to

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,869
be that person to the face of a real

00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:45,689
person than it is to a mythical icon out

00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:48,329
there in cyberspace at least in my

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:51,300
experience about 99 percent of the time

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,920
they will back down and that that 1% is

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,449
just a troll you're never gonna win over

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,360
maybe they're even a bot you don't

00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:00,420
they're not even people you know so I'm

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,910
big on but I realize recognize my

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,329
privileges my privilege that I'm not

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,490
afraid of that and I know that's a big

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:11,850
ask for some people if anybody do you

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,519
have anything about that I think from

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,439
time to time you are wrong and it's it's

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,670
important to acknowledge that you have

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:19,350
to use your judgement in sort of see

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,240
situations where maybe you said

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,889
something that didn't work out or you

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,259
did something that made somebody upset

00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,329
and sort of acknowledging your own wrong

00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,370
and not being too proud to realize that

00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,809
you messed up and one of the things that

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,220
I always try to do personally and it

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,410
came from a friend it's not my wisdom at

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,879
all is instead of saying you're sorry

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,379
when you do something to mess up say

00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,869
thank you to the person who corrected

00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,399
you because if you say I'm sorry they

00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:43,439
feel they need to say oh it's okay and

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,089
it's not okay you messed up you need to

00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:46,589
be corrected so say thank you that they

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,009
corrected you and move forward and learn

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,009
from that

00:10:51,180 --> 00:11:03,140
anybody else so I'm just breaking in to

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:09,870
tech I don't have a whole lot of

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:12,570
experience with because sir I don't know

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:17,940
a lot of experience with being rejected

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:25,220
to my face but one thing that has helped

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:28,710
me is to shift my perspective to really

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:41,279
being able to sell myself as an

00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:43,410
individual because I feel like like when

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,210
you walk in expecting to be rejected

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,420
because I'm black or am weldon or I

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:53,880
don't have the degree or the experience

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:59,339
that other people have it doesn't set me

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,920
up for success so I've just learned to

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,750
value the person that I am and to value

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:10,370
the relationships that I make and that

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,370
has worked well for me cool thank you

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,339
okay next question I think it was Amin

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,180
sorry I don't really know everybody's

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,510
names there's just the people that came

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,279
to talk to me I think you really

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,800
appreciate the opportunity to hear the

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,650
different perspectives my question

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,120
starts with the commentary I've been to

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,490
a couple of events before where there's

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,279
a focus on women in technology or women

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,190
in stem the observation it was shared

00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,200
was that after about five to seven years

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,350
women become the solution of the lack of

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,880
a career ladder and it's basically a

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,070
jumble of people doing things and

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,959
there's no distinction no achievement or

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,880
all level threes we're all level fours

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,420
there's no recognition of individual

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,620
merit beyond you know being in time and

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,839
you've got you get paid so the question

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,149
really is and cross-cutting different

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,609
groups from age to gender to identity

00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,679
if we promote more of a merit-based

00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,809
approach to what we do

00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,160
I know open source does more so than

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,660
some other places but in general for

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,579
technology

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,429
have you experienced things where you've

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,199
got like a fellow program people that

00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:22,509
are that are recognized experts in their

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,089
field within the company regardless of

00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,160
who or what they are and has it been

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:35,439
effective so there's open question thank

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:37,509
you yeah first of all we're laughing up

00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:40,389
here because there was a blog a while

00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,639
ago by a marginalized member of the node

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,609
community which is just it's so

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,489
endlessly entertaining to work on node

00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:51,220
this woman was saying that the word

00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:53,859
meritocracy was problematic because it

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,749
sets too high a bar for really

00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,939
marginalized people to have to improve

00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:00,579
themselves in some kind of pecking order

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:02,949
or now that was her understanding of it

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:05,499
and inside of apache which is who she

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:07,239
was mainly picking on there was a it

00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,829
prompted a whole conversation about is

00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:11,019
there another word we can use that won't

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:14,889
trigger people quite so much they've

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,709
settled on do AA cracy which is it's

00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:21,100
sort of the same thing they mean to say

00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:23,350
people get people get measured based on

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,350
their contribution that's what they're

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,660
that's what they mean to say and they're

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,609
trying not to pick words that trigger

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,339
people feeling like they can't achieve

00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:38,470
or they can't surmount whatever that

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:40,209
that hill is so you but your question

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,079
was about fellow stuff and you and I

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,850
talked before I found that a disused

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,919
fellow track can be a useful thing in

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,739
certain contexts because you can reach

00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,169
ret it to be meaningful and I don't see

00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:54,549
a lot of fellow communities inside big

00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:57,129
companies that actually have much

00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:58,660
meaning so I think generally it's time

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,319
to call them into question and see if

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,910
they couldn't be retreaded a little bit

00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:06,579
it used to be when tech companies had

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,709
more money than than anybody and they

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:11,109
did for a long time they also all had

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,639
labs and the difference between being

00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,949
brought into the lab or being on the

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,550
fellow track or had to do with are you

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:19,720
in product or are you in research

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,130
nowadays there aren't that many labs

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,149
left and so you know it got kind of

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,070
conglomerated but it's still it's a mess

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,450
it's it's very hard as an individual

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,490
contributor to find yourself on that

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,230
track and what Eamonn told me that I

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,930
didn't know his boeing is actually

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,579
pretty good at identifying cross company

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,250
contribution and and raising it

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,740
he even as a junior engineer was was

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,260
tagged for that track because of his

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,940
direct work that's the kind of thing

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,000
that's supposed to happen in open-source

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,250
but even an Apache every time we do a

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
member election there's somebody who we

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,630
all thought was already a member that we

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,279
just missed it that they never got asked

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,829
you know so they've now written some

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,350
algorithms to try to weed those based on

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,730
how much mail they write figure out

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,910
who's actually doing most of the talking

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,180
I think it's hard as as things scale out

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,290
it's really hard to keep track of merit

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,050
yeah there's a lot of literature

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,360
actually now on meritocracy because it

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,360
became such a bad word in the

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,760
open-source community the nodejs

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,750
example but there there are others and

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,490
the idea is how are you defining merit

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,899
and how do you define success to go back

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,339
to what Denise and I were talking about

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,140
a little while ago right it's different

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,490
for everybody and also while open-source

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,839
can keep you anonymous to a certain

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,449
degree because you're contributing and

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,949
you're working virtually online I've

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,769
talked to a lot of women so I'll just be

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:49,420
in that context who you know will go to

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:51,490
a mailing list of a particular project

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,649
and they're not even going to attempt to

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,350
you know try to get merit because it's

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,640
so visceral the the engagement right

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,760
that's not every open-source software

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,670
project I love open-source love it but

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,799
right this does exist and so that alone

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,750
keeps some marginalized groups out

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,770
because they don't like this is the

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,179
difference between diversity and

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,559
inclusiveness right how do you create an

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,740
inclusive community so that you attract

00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,480
a diverse you know talent pool so

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,640
anyways there's lots of stuff out there

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,449
on that and it's a dicey topic but I

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,049
know at least in the open-source

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,510
community it's become kind of a bad word

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,770
meritocracy definitely has

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,700
it's a pity though because I think it

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,320
wasn't a bad thing

00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,100
in its beginning the way that you just

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,660
defined it - yeah absolutely make sense

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,400
sorry but I've been told by extremely

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,800
marginalized people that it's really too

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,960
big and ask to expect them to show up

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,130
given to put their hand up but they

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,900
still want the merit

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,330
well you mentioned Drupal earlier - and

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,160
like Jerry says the you know the juice

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,600
and Angie the two of them yeah I mean

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,850
juries did a great keynote this last

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,080
year about you know it's great to think

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,580
that everybody can contribute to open

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
source but like marginalized groups

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,880
especially women who are mothers and

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,620
caretakers they don't have the time to

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,290
always volunteer and give before they're

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,330
paid to do so um so again these are like

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,100
barriers to entry more than like but but

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,540
the barrier to entry can sometimes like

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,800
they can't even start to move up it all

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,850
sounds so negative that's not what I'm

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,430
trying to say but as long as we're as

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,290
long as we're here talking about rupal I

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,720
served on the board of Drupal for six

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,340
years so I am biased but I I was

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,110
interested in them because of their

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,390
gender diversity I wanted to understand

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,160
why that was happening and I think it's

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,040
a multi-prong thing I think it's the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,830
area they're working in which is web

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,630
sites so there's a typical division of

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,430
labor there's all these what they call

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,740
lifestyle companies which is basically a

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,260
ma a husband and wife or two partners

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,660
who one of them is more creative more

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,070
designing and is doing the design half

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,260
and the other one is doing the coding

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,210
half doesn't really say which one is

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,190
which but that that's how the division

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,960
of labor is happening and they're

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,930
getting enough work to you know run

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,300
their household on that on that income

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:04,900
Drupal sang along in that key for a

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,850
really long time six very successfully

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,730
before they had their real for their

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:13,000
real big challenge to that community and

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,860
so I think it can work but you have to

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,290
keep everybody kind of on the same page

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,510
as soon as Driss is company started

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:23,680
getting very successful people started

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:28,740
grumbling so anyway it was that enough

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,740
of it okay anybody else Oh

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:35,510
Thank You Remy okay I thought you'd

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,690
switch I'm sorry I shouldn't have

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,360
accused you okay

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,540
[Music]

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,900
I would also challenge people to unpack

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,480
the concept of meritocracy and look at

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,610
the arbiters of merit and whose

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,610
assigning merit are are the things that

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,680
are meritorious things that the people

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,770
in charge already consider themselves to

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,300
happen to be pretty good at so that's

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,100
one thing and then you also made a

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,670
comment about women self selecting out

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,690
and one thing that you can do that's to

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,630
keep women in a particular track is

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,970
whether or not they are mothers and I

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:21,500
happen I'm not I don't have children but

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,930
to give flex time part-time let people

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,400
leave give them the option to have a

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:30,890
family and nine times out of ten women

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,500
to end up doing certain types of

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:36,590
gendered work around childbearing and

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,630
child-rearing and let them come back

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,090
this is a problem a lot of people have

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,770
babies I have lots of friends that can't

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,290
get back into the workforce because they

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,630
can't find a part-time job and they can

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,080
work but they don't have 40 60 hours a

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,930
week and making that available to women

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,920
is one really easy way that we can keep

00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:01,520
women past that 5 to 7 you're bursting

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,980
you are wait there's a there's one right

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,800
there

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,060
comment exactly I went to a the NC State

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,670
and graduated to the young lady who

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,860
moved back to Norway and she moved back

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,060
to Norway had her kids everyone paid for

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,500
to stay at home and she's talking on

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:20,000
software company at home so there was

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,160
definitely supporting there's a question

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,710
earlier about the government support for

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,890
women in in tech women and business that

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,380
was direct support for time at home she

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,000
had her kids and she's basically worked

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,680
in home started a company I think she

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,840
works for another company now but very

00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,980
successful so your point is well made

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,600
and it really sticks out a success and

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,590
the incredible achievements possible

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,690
with the proper support

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:51,639
thank you also conferences that don't

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,019
offer child care are not being helpful

00:21:51,639 --> 00:22:01,190
there was a hallelujah in the back there

00:21:54,019 --> 00:22:06,499
Claire okay another question I hate the

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:10,850
microphone um so okay so we've talked a

00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:12,590
lot about individuals right and

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,960
especially like in the documentary

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,509
raising individual women up but what my

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,340
favorite part about the documentary was

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:21,860
actually talking about the community

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,720
that was built and so I guess I'm

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,240
wondering taking that one step further

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,669
if there's a space in the tech world for

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,759
collective ownership of tech companies

00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:35,029
so it's not just one woman or one person

00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:38,539
who fits the diversity token but if a

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:41,389
tech company or cooperative I guess in

00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,369
this case would be able to exist or if

00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:44,749
that's too much at odds with venture

00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,179
capital and the people who fund this

00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,220
world well I would say that's what

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,110
Apache was set up to be although it was

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,659
not set up around diversity but it was

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,950
set up around opportunity for people

00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,499
that were going to work outside of the

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,600
system it's 20 years old now so it looks

00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,330
like it's a venerable institution but

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,509
I'm here to tell you it was absolutely

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,220
seat-of-the-pants

00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,369
initially and that's what they were

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,259
organized around so sure given that that

00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,850
exists given the Drupal exists and there

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:12,409
are many other projects there's no

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,700
reason that there couldn't be a project

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,980
that's organized around that it would be

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,310
very interesting actually I think

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,540
companies to startups I think that

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,910
[Music]

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,170
I think I don't have a good example to

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,300
share right now but I know

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,590
in fact follow up with me if you like or

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll get your card because I've read

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,820
some stories about teams of women who

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,950
are doing exactly that and they all have

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:39,160
you know equal share in the ownership of

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:42,280
the company there are a lot of questions

00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,080
that way so right I had a question and

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,470
it seemed like some of it was touched

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,650
upon by the lady in the green but my

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,920
question is dealing with dealing with

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:58,060
women in the workforce looking at return

00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:01,150
ships jobs share different ways that

00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:05,650
women can stay in the workforce is

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:07,570
seeing that the return ships which is to

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,730
help women to come back into the

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:16,110
workforce and that they have been out of

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:20,140
work being caregivers for others whoever

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:23,500
but and I see this more so with

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,770
companies doing are doing it in the

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:31,060
California in New York area but for some

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:35,440
reason is really not being done so much

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,460
here in the Carolinas but even with it

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,940
being done in California and in New York

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,160
I don't see we're in it is totally

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,820
helping women to get back into the

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,710
workforce

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,040
because it does not present the

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,670
opportunities to work part-time or do

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,940
jobs shares so what are companies doing

00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,920
in this area in our companies making any

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,070
type of arrangements for not only women

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,800
but other people who do want to work but

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:09,250
they need to work part-time or do job

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,950
shares so I think I think that's

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,580
happening in companies that have a hard

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:18,850
time acquiring talent so boring

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,260
companies like no seriously and I'm now

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,470
gonna name one cuz I just worked for

00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:25,840
them for five years and that's PayPal

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,690
they did a return to work program and

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,360
they did offer part-time and job share

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,260
and all that stuff it was pretty

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
rigorous like they take in 60

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,330
and maybe ten of them would actually get

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,060
jobs there was kind of a bootcamp feel

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,860
to it before they made the offers Cedric

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,470
you you paid attention to that no you

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,780
don't want to talk about it well the the

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,750
official line is that I believe is that

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:53,630
they are reconsidering how to support it

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,970
going forward but the current result is

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,880
there is not there is not an active

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,440
program running anymore oh that's too

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,110
bad because they were doing it in India

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,850
in addition to America and I have a

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,380
friend who tried to get in it and was

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,470
unsuccessful and she was really unhappy

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,210
about it so anyway it's a good idea

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,710
there should be more of it so it'd be

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:23,240
interesting to find out why it isn't

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:24,980
what didn't work for them right no they

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,810
didn't say that coming in but they did

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,460
say this is a bit of a boot camp and

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,890
we're screening for the best candidates

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,660
they did say that and I think they paid

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,940
them for their time for the internship

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,450
too so it wasn't they weren't there was

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,740
no loss per se it was paid positions but

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,010
it was I mean it was absolutely

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,400
full-time it was it was not a it was not

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:51,920
a as you as you say it's not part-time

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,450
supportive there was no I didn't with

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,120
that one but the one in the one in the

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,090
US was very I mean it was you know come

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,650
in work your 50 hours so about half of

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,300
the engineering resource and PayPal is

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,190
in India and the other half is spread

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,100
out around the world so that's why it

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,840
was a focal point anyway to your point

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,510
ma'am that it's a really good idea there

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,680
should be more of it be nice if there's

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,720
something government could do they could

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,830
offer a subsidy for that program and

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,070
then everybody would win I have one note

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,500
on return ships I didn't know they

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,500
existed until about a week ago and I

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,410
looked into it and I was disappointed to

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:34,550
find out that return ships it means

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:37,940
returning to tech for the program that I

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:41,060
came across which meant that I was not

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,000
eligible as someone who is starting tech

00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:47,419
now so I have a 12 year break where I

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,789
took care of my kids primarily

00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:52,789
I was working in a pharmacy and in a

00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:57,830
bakery before then I wasn't in corporate

00:27:52,789 --> 00:28:00,019
or any tech company so I think we have a

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,509
long way to go to making things more

00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:07,490
accessible to people who are really

00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:12,980
trying to jump up a class for the first

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,539
time I wanted to speak to that Nikki

00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,220
made you talk touched on some of this

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,840
earlier and I just needed some

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,549
additional action items so I'm having

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,190
difficulty reaching low income women

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:28,159
with children and trying to get them to

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:31,369
come into IT they don't even consider it

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,350
as a career and is there anything that I

00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,480
can do to change that or to make them

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,789
understand that this is open to them

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:43,240
they do not have to be a mathematics

00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,240
genius to do this any suggestions

00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:52,309
because I have had a lifelong love of

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:55,570
tech so it was it's always been like a

00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:58,999
no brainer like I'd love to work in tech

00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:04,070
but I think if you're trying to reach

00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:10,759
low-income mothers which I am if you

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:13,360
could if you could somehow provide the

00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,860
support and let them understand that

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,559
they will be supported that they don't

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,840
have to choose a career over there over

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,639
their family because that's one choice

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,509
that I've never been willing to make

00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:28,970
which is I think why maybe it's taking

00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:34,730
me longer or I have to take a different

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:36,799
path to get in but if you could set up a

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,259
support system where people feel like I

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:44,470
can be a mother and I can have this

00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:48,110
career attack and the income is

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,940
life-changing like we talked about being

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,590
able to build wealth and have things to

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,759
leave to your children and be able to

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:58,570
take care of your parents who might

00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,570
still be working into their 70s

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:08,170
just just the income potential is if you

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,630
could drive that home that yes you can

00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,190
earn this kind of income and you're

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,520
capable of doing this work because

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,280
people anyone can be taught like there's

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,900
a tech career for everyone you don't

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,400
even have to be a programmer like there

00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,250
are different things that you can do in

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,440
tech so if you could just drive that

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,140
home that there's a place for you you

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,590
can get paid well and you don't have to

00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:36,580
give up your family to do that and and

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:40,960
make that true like if if it's a 40-hour

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,220
week you know full-time like then

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,580
something's gotta give

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:50,250
but if it's true that there's a support

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:53,350
for family and work-life balance I think

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,440
just the money alone is enough that

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,990
would get me in the door also you never

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,180
know what impact you're gonna have when

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,920
I was manager at Apple I tried to help a

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,070
woman that was a single mom she was

00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:08,110
super good at her job but she was a

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,430
hourly employee so she had no health

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,100
care and other things like that

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,080
and I had an opening that I tailored to

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,460
her and I offered her a job she was

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,260
going to be paid forty eight thousand

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:22,810
dollars a year and this was such a

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,940
mind-blowing thing to her she went home

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,980
to talk to her family and her father who

00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,600
had never made forty eight thousand

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,390
dollars a year basically told her she

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,570
wasn't good enough so she declined the

00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,190
job and you know I spent some time

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,440
talking to her about how why that

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,420
happened and I told her that I

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,220
understood why she was making the choice

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,810
and I wasn't going to push her but I

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,010
wanted her to know that what her father

00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,860
had said wasn't true

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:51,820
and that she was being influenced for

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:53,950
the wrong reasons and she called me

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,470
about ten years later she was taking her

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,910
first management position and she said I

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,340
never would have gotten here if you

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,560
hadn't offered me that job so it's worth

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,460
doing it even if it doesn't connect

00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,460
right in the moment

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,730
so we're getting close to the end of our

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:17,919
time a little nap too because I think

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,480
people think technology jobs and we're

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,019
all war and I think the majority of us

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,390
working them are really hard compared to

00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:27,549
a lot of hourly work I've been in retail

00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,640
and went through a Christmas crunch and

00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:33,460
barely got paid right and you're there

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,309
for a hundred hours and four in a week

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,950
or or working an hourly job where you

00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:41,769
have almost no flexibility when you work

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,590
in tech I don't know a major corporation

00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:46,269
that doesn't give you enough flexibility

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,519
you might work an 80 hour week

00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:50,649
occasionally or you might do it on a

00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,240
regular basis but you have a lot of

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:53,980
flexibility to do other things in

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,620
between and you don't really have to

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,669
work that many hours so don't give up

00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,370
it's not hard

00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:04,210
yes I keep pushing and you have to ask

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:06,190
people especially if everybody can do

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:11,980
this job with a little bit of training

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:14,669
it's just just ask them thank you thank

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,350
you so much to everyone for being here

00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:20,260
Jennifer one of the observations I was

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:22,450
thinking about in the film with kind of

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:26,200
the observation that there aren't any

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:28,470
major female venture capitalists I think

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,370
it speaks to this broader

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,840
decentralization of wealth and power

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:34,899
that has to happen because that's a

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,580
white woman I'm making 70% of what my

00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:39,419
white male peers are making and then

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:43,649
women of color make even less than that

00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:46,419
estimated about half give or take and

00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:48,880
you know I understand that there's a

00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:53,380
need for that to change

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,519
but it feels like there's you know when

00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,080
you look at women's history there's

00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,510
constantly like this chicken and egg

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,240
problem like which thing do we go after

00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:04,899
first and we'll the other things

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,059
naturally follow but do you know of

00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:09,359
anything there happening like in the

00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,919
venture capitalist space or any

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,740
initiatives there are like a women's

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,859
collective to create a venture capital

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,950
fund because when you look at the other

00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,659
numbers around it like you

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,269
if you're a white male without a college

00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,679
degree you're a tech genius and if

00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:27,029
you're a woman with the master's degree

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,289
you're barely qualified for the

00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:32,220
entry-level job so there's like other

00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:36,059
issues surrounding it there's actually a

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:39,029
number of female lead initiatives around

00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:41,519
BC unfortunately I don't think they're

00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:43,470
making enough they're not having enough

00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,119
traction yet but I would check out all

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,919
race it's the most highly visible one

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,480
and they're doing good work but there's

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,909
also work being done in Boston with

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,269
women of color in the VC space so there

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:56,009
are efforts underway but they're slow

00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:57,029
they're too slow I'm hesitating to go

00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,950
into great detail I know we're running

00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,809
out of time I'm happy to talk to you

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,359
afterwards too but there is efforts

00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:05,329
there they need more support the problem

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,210
of VC is it's based on a very specific

00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:11,400
computation right of ROI and women-led

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,230
businesses don't always fall into that

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,299
cookie cutter approach right and so it's

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:18,900
expanding our thinking about what is ROI

00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:20,279
and how much return is enough return or

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,230
good enough return and that takes a

00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:25,170
different type of investor maybe that's

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,640
a woman maybe it's you know maybe it's a

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:30,539
totally different type of venture fund

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,160
and those are they exist but we're

00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:33,720
measuring it by the wrong success

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,710
metrics in my opinion again going back

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,999
to that idea of how do you measure

00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:41,369
success yeah all right so we got a

00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:43,380
wrap-up now unfortunately I wish we

00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:46,859
could stay here but we we have some time

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,410
out at the food to talk some more and so

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,910
please all of you stick around and then

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,670
I'm gonna say the thing I always say at

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:59,839
these events which is if you have a

00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:03,019
small girl in your world tinker with her

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,900
it is the single most successful

00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:09,390
statistic is people who grow up to be me

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,890
had somebody tinkering with them when

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,349
they were children my dad used to let me

00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:16,650
take clocks apart he thought that was

00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:18,690
fine right so I got the message that it

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,259
was cool to tinker and that made it okay

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,970
to be a geek so that is the single

00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:25,619
strongest thing that you can do do all

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,499
the other things too but go home and do

00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,839
that one thing and thank you all for

00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:32,839
