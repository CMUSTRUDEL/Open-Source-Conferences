Title: Discussion With The Producer, Jennifer Cloer

Description: 
	Discussion With The Producer, Jennifer Cloer. Danese Cooper and Jennifer discuss Progress and the Power of Community, Episode 2 of the 'Chasing Grace' series.

While most data tell us there’s no progress, the women who work in tech every day know different. Change is incremental but it is happening. Episode 2 will explore where we do see progress – in the individual stories of women who have started companies, nonprofit organizations and women-in-tech groups. The challenges they face when they do stand up, speak out or challenge the status quo will also be explored to understand where we’re failing so that we may accelerate progress. 

The first sign of a movement is organization. The emergence of women in tech groups inside and outside of companies demonstrate that this movement is gaining momentum. Just a few years ago, women in tech groups were few and far between and now they’re commonplace. The episode explores the phenomenon of community for women, the value they place on it and whether or not it’s making a difference in progress.

[Music]

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,660
are you trying to figure out what the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,230
best the best starting point is here

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,700
okay I'm gonna start kind of a little

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,340
bit of the way in okay

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,880
how common do you think it is to to live

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,579
a double life

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,170
oh if you're a marginalized person I

00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,939
mean that that was about women living a

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,519
double life but I think we have lots of

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,879
other groups yeah I mean it came up in

00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:38,370
the talks earlier and in today's event

00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,290
right where you know can you be your

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,620
authentic self at work do you have to

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,600
kind of hide who you are right and come

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,670
out of the closet or not it's funny I

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,230
have a story when I was a little girl

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,090
like third fourth grade I had this best

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,620
friend and we had this conversation in

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,199
the girls bathroom in my elementary

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,980
school like are you the same at school

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,739
as you are at home no you know even at

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,229
that young age we had developed this

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,090
this idea that we had to be a little bit

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,500
different in public and at school than

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,270
we could be at home that's my own

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,880
personal anecdote but I think that yeah

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,750
I do think it's a common experience

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,030
bye-bye many people who consider

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,610
themselves minorities is there some way

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,020
that we can help people you know feel

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,299
more comfortable being a center this

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,350
this kind of this but I mean with didn't

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,400
work within work you know one of the

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,420
things we explored here and I couldn't

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,430
go in depth because you're always

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,740
limited by time is this idea of

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,210
community and at least I don't know what

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,850
you think Denise but over the last I'd

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,530
say five years women in tech communities

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,700
and other minority and tech communities

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,009
have really sprung up inside of

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,840
companies and across the industry yeah I

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,850
think that that is helping I think that

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,890
things are starting to change and like I

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,439
mentioned story can change culture but

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,860
it is a long I always say the f-word

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,500
game I would like to say so when I was

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,670
at Apple a long time ago now thirty

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,110
years ago there was a gay student union

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,200
that's what they called themselves and

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,719
they were very actively pushing an

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,880
agenda and they were they were helped by

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,890
the fact that Elizabeth birch was our

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,209
chief litigator Elizabeth birch for

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,709
those of you don't know later with the

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,440
executive director of the Human Rights

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:21,000
Council which is the blue thing with the

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,930
equal sign right and she was using her

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,620
rolodex to call anybody any

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,390
CEO in the valley to twist their arm to

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,879
accept domestic partnership and that was

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,430
like her single agenda yeah right and

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,430
she I think should be known as the

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,980
person who made that happen but they

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,049
used that they leverage that voice that

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,560
they created inside of Apple to make

00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:47,810
Apple at least more consistent and now

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,310
the guy who runs Apple is openly gay and

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,680
that's that's a big win that's a big

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,810
deal I think I don't see women's groups

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,720
pushing in the same direction inside of

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,370
companies as much and I think we could

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,010
very easily because I think it's a

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,409
combination of community and leveraging

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,030
those types of people in positions of

00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,730
power and I think sometimes we're a

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,109
little too hesitant to ask one of the

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,480
things I've learned since I left my

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,299
comfy day job and started as an

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,290
entrepreneur you did it was very comfy

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:22,389
but is when you asked for me especially

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,500
among women they show up they show up so

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,549
somebody asked me recently like what's

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,819
your number one piece of advice for

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:34,099
younger women and and I said ask for the

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,709
job lead ask for the introduction to

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:38,720
this person and just you know rising up

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,299
together and and and maximizing people

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,680
who are in positions of power to be your

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:48,019
advocate so when I joined tech most of

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,310
the women that were in positions of

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,109
power and you and I knew some of the

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,209
same ones we're kind of like guys

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,430
running running around in skirts I mean

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,829
they were they had fought to get where

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,169
they were going on men's term right and

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,120
they weren't particularly sisterly right

00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,759
a more junior women are you seeing that

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,189
change now I am seeing it changed but

00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,810
I'm also told by almost every not every

00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,340
woman I interview but a lot of the women

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,229
I interview that that still exists

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,419
there's a there's a competitive nature

00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:15,829
among women particularly at the top who

00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,799
are like whoa I worked really hard to

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:20,690
get here I got my space step back

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,659
yeah right pulling that ladder up behind

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,669
yeah exactly but I think that it's I

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:28,220
think that that's becoming less common

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,169
and I do feel like women are supporting

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,570
women and I also feel an is he and I

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,219
have had this conversation that a shift

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,870
has happened in the last I'd say just

00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,720
five years where you don't have to

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,190
embody

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,170
masculine traits to be a successful

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,410
woman in tech and that didn't used to be

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,880
the case I I'm a perfect example I

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,910
worked among many many men in the valley

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,040
and I you know would adopt their

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,350
characteristics as my own for a while

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,330
and I think I've I've started to shift

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,440
and a lot of people I've talked to don't

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,450
feel like they have to do that anymore

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,300
you can show up as a woman in takun and

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,960
you've got a unique set of

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,570
characteristics and experiences that

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,210
really contribute to all areas of tech

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,270
see I have been forever told that it's

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,530
nice that I'm feminine as a leader but I

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,260
don't even know what that means yeah

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,210
seriously different it means I think I

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,830
mean gender right it's different for

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,260
everybody right it means something

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,910
different to everybody but I think it to

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,660
your point like people telling you that

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,070
it takes all kinds of people to build

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,360
the technology that will define the

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,280
future when I talk about a less

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,250
inclusive world tomorrow than today I

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,530
mean we in tech are building the reality

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,300
that we will live in tomorrow and if we

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,740
don't have every single type of person

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,200
scary

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,550
yikes well also we can't be given what's

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,169
happening in this country right now and

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,000
you know again I don't actually live

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,680
here anymore but given what's happening

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,540
in this country we really have to fight

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,370
even harder against that do you agree

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,490
there's a push to try to push us back

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,680
out of the out of the work force okay so

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,780
about privilege

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,140
how can people like acknowledge

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,790
privilege and and kind of get through it

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,380
and become better Alice it looks like

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,860
guy did a very good job of self

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,190
questioning but he's a rare guy I know a

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,810
guy guys who are a guy that's why I had

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,860
coffee with him and I actually was in

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,630
the meeting that he's talking about so

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,800
are you yeah I don't know if remember

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,410
that yeah oh yes I remember it I

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,210
actually had that person we're gonna

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,620
talk about her in a minute okay okay you

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,540
know I think I certainly have my

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,919
privilege to write and I and I talked

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,930
about that when we were discussing

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,580
before he went on camera and I think a

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,560
lot of it is listening and knowing that

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:46,470
you have to be curious intentional and

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,539
and listen I have been so fortunate that

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,310
so many women of color have agreed to

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,220
talk to me

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,900
both on camera and off camera and the

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,640
best conversations are ones where we

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,440
show up and say I might say something

00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,570
really offensive and not even know it

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,850
yeah right both of us right but let's

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,140
just say okay that's all right let's

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,400
have this conversation and learn from

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,780
each other I'm getting goose bumps

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,910
saying those words because it just

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,650
inspires me yeah yeah you know but I

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,540
think I think having those types of

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,590
candid open conversations I'm gonna put

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,150
my foot in my mouth

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,590
please accept that I'm human and let's

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,660
learn from each other I super appreciate

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,090
what people pointed out yeah especially

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,770
if they're sort of kind in putting it

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,780
out rather than you know standing up and

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,890
starting to scream at me which we said

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,860
did a fair amount of that and that

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:32,180
really did Sorokin sighs okay now you

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,820
know coming from a Buddhist point of

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,950
view immense advocacy groups we are them

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,100
they are us we are a part of the same

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,410
right world what do we do about that I

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,930
mean there's there's so much fear and

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:51,050
just kind of is that even something we

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:53,900
can take on question no no I don't have

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,520
a good answer for that like Claire I

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,470
wasn't aware of men's rights groups

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,470
they're very closely associated with the

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,780
insel community so men's rights groups

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,380
do not represent men and all men this is

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,680
a very extreme sect of this type of

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,510
community I could do a whole documentary

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,690
like a two-hour feature just on these

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,130
types of groups but I didn't go in-depth

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,530
I don't know what the answer to that is

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,750
I liked introducing the idea through

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,910
Claire story because it shows the

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,550
complexity right she was excluding

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,750
people from her groups and I think she

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,640
learned something as a result of that

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,010
men are now allowed in her groups they

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,140
rarely show up this group that sued her

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,880
didn't want to go to her meetings they

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,790
wanted to take her out of business right

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,640
so but but it helps to demonstrate the

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,780
complexity so I guess I'd say you know I

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,940
think somebody mentioned it earlier date

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,920
these are difficult things these are not

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,140
you know we are humans and we are messy

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,490
and these are not easy things to to fix

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,220
but I hope by sharing the stories it

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,930
makes you think I used to always teach

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,760
speaking skills and she

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,310
Kikki which is another event that's a

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,560
female only event and I talked a lot to

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,149
Kalia about why it was that way and what

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,100
I found was a lot of women that would

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:10,220
not have spoken up in a mixed audience

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,320
we're more willing to talk right and it

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,080
there is probably a place for that I

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
agree so I I mean my personal opinion

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,740
I'm happy to share that is that we need

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,260
all spaces so I believe that we need

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,860
spaces for just men and we need spaces

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,600
for just women and we need spaces for

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,279
LGBTQ but we also need spaces where we

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,920
all come together right the slide

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,209
earlier today the segregation inclusion

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,890
right the ultimate goal is that we're

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,320
all working together and work you know

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,050
but I do think that at least now in the

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,200
evolution of this movement I feel like

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:44,000
there is a need for some spaces where

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,080
people can can do that because some

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,470
people don't feel comfortable sharing

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,380
yeah they really does so okay let's go

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,959
ahead and talk about the role of social

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,240
justice warrior ship in Waiting hack

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,520
that's a big it's a big topic this is

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,680
the time that guy got called out and

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,709
Effie mithya was there too

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,050
there was in one of the large very large

00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,150
very influential open source communities

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,400
there was a woman who was working on

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,740
behalf of the community to create more

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,900
inclusion and diversity but she was

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,660
surpassing the community's actual

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,400
appetite to go there even many of the

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,540
marginalized people that she supposedly

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,310
represented would come up to me

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,580
privately and say she's not talking for

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,200
me she was willing to throw the project

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,290
under the bus specifically the tech

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,420
under the bus for her agenda and that's

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,370
the point that it broke for me like I

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,350
was really trying to find bridges with

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,880
her until I realized that she didn't

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,730
care about whether or not this

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,680
open-source project was technically able

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,990
to go forward she just wanted to talk

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,970
about the social issue that she and and

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,980
she'd picked this community because it

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,630
already had a firm and a diversity which

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,070
is super interesting yeah anyway she's

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,540
moved to long term in the community now

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,360
because she couldn't gain purchase there

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,770
but what do you do when you are attacked

00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,360
like that because she was running around

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,459
attacking anybody she attacked me too

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm apparently a gender trader and a

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:08,400
rape apologist so there you guys are

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:12,930
strong words she was into that Wow

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,880
that's another hard one no no I knew

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,779
they would not be easy these aren't easy

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,400
topics you know I think you know that

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,350
particular situation and using that to

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,589
inform a response I mean I feel like

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,210
everybody shows up like I like I say in

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,680
the voiceover with a variety of

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,640
experiences that inform how they show up

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,710
and how they see the world

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,720
in a case like that or similar cases

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,140
there's something going on right they

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,820
have had a bad experience or experiences

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,640
and that's informing how they show up

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,890
and so I think well that is a difficult

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,170
thing I think we have to listen right we

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,000
have to listen and honor that there's a

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,790
reason that they're taking that extreme

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,330
of an approach and learn from that as

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:57,240
well the response from us to that type

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,980
of you know behavior may show our

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,360
previous experiences right and that's

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,470
where you can sometimes hit these walls

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,510
oh yeah totally

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,980
she completely surprised me yeah we're

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,480
not been able to talk to somebody about

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,680
to present I've been in your shoes I

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,690
know what you're talking about you're

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,040
like what but I guess trying to I guess

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,930
it's empathy right I guess that's what

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,029
I'm describing is is understanding that

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,110
everybody has lived a messy life until

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,630
the moment they show up in front of you

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,450
having that conversation and you know

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,250
it's I hope it doesn't sound like a easy

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,080
out with this answer but I do think

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,510
listening is really powerful in males

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,070
allies ask me what can they do listen

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,110
listen to the women in your workplace

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,459
and in your life because you learned so

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,010
much when you listen and very few of us

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,339
really really really listen okay thank

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,290
you

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,560
all right you know the VC situation yeah

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,510
yeah

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,250
so our women just stuck bootstrapping

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,760
because it's too hard to do anything

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,540
else

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,720
no no I liked making the point in the

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,070
film that a lot of female entrepreneurs

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,500
go a different route than the

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,330
traditional VC route um and I like that

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,950
I like that theme but like you know what

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm not gonna do it the traditional way

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm gonna go do it my own way I love

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:11,940
that but women need more access to

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,190
venture capital and my opinion is we

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,839
need more women writing the damn checks

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,839
we need more female VCS

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,310
well all we really need is one to be

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,089
super successful and then we'll have a

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,220
bunch I know I know I'm considering you

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,769
know we have two more episodes in this

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:37,740
series and I'm considering one focused

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:39,190
on on the bestiality how maybe happy

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,860
okay

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,480
do you feel so you'll remember this

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,740
story that when I that people tried to

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,329
fire me for the first five and a half

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,620
years that I was at Sun because I was an

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,240
agent of change and you always want to

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,680
shoot the messenger and then in the last

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,990
six months everybody wanted to take

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,940
credit for my work and particularly men

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,740
wanting to do that and I was really

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,750
upset about it for you know about a

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,490
month and then I realized that I didn't

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,050
actually want to be an officer of that

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,459
company and that this man I could

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,110
declare victory and go somewhere else

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,750
and get paid more yeah and that's what

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,420
happened but that's why I redefine

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,860
success for myself because it was kind

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,990
of the only option the other option was

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,180
to be miserable Yeah right or tap-dance

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,490
faster which I wasn't willing to do are

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,029
women doing that and women routinely

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,649
redefining what success means I think so

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,029
the hundreds of women I've interviewed

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,790
and talked to it's one of the main

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:29,050
themes is they are defining success for

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,420
themselves and it has a lot to do with

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,970
you know being the primary caretakers in

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,380
your families it has to do with you know

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,509
the role of women in society and what a

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,920
success really look like when you go

00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,569
into a workplace that's been dominated

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,610
by men there is a borough there is a you

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:44,380
know this is what success looks like but

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,579
I think with more and more women coming

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,920
into the workplace over the last three

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,269
four decades right I think that finally

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,670
we're starting to redefine what that

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,050
looks like especially in tech I love

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,930
Elena's quote right that's not what

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,730
success looks like for me mm-hmm right I

00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,380
love that and and it's different for

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,509
everybody and I think you know when you

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,810
step into your power and you're

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,110
confident enough in what you're doing

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,300
you can define what that means for you

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,980
and that's why I love the power of

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,160
community message from this piece

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,449
because I and again I'm speaking to open

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,300
source here because we're at all things

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:21,130
open but the open source community it

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
can be maddening but it's also so

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,569
supportive yeah incredibly so I mean we

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,079
figured out community over code twenty

00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:28,360
years ago

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,250
it's more important to be friends with

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,810
the people you're working with that

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,160
doesn't mean you can throw the

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,140
project under the bus from a technical

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,290
perspective that's still a problem but

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,570
you you can lean on that community and

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,800
that's a beautiful thing I think it's

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,660
important to remember that open source

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,450
was started by people who didn't fit in

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,950
to the normal paradigm which is the same

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,020
as all the marginalized people that are

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,810
coming to tech now we all started in the

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,940
same place although you know the early

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,100
folks in open source were were so out on

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,200
the spectrum that they were there now

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,640
we're revising things a little bit we're

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,170
saying well that's not OK behavior

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,420
anymore because we want to be more

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,310
inclusive ourselves but yeah I would

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,600
really encourage any of you who are

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,279
wondering about this because women have

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,650
been coming up to me and the break to

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,140
talk about their career aspirations get

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,220
involved in open source even if that's

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,800
happening in your spare time it's worth

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,290
doing my friend Andy Oliver here said

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,230
when I needed a job I could walk in and

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,870
say you're already using my code yeah ok

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,390
that's very powerful so can see I know

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,860
it seems like an extra chore when you're

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,080
trying to raise kids and you've got a

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,550
job too but if you can spend even a

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,140
little bit of time every week on an

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,750
open-source project it'll be a good

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,490
thing for you truly and if you're

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,010
wondering which project to get involved

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,690
with subscribe to a lot of mailing lists

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,190
and see how they talk to each other and

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,260
pick one that you like the feel of

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,850
because there are every flavor out there

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,950
that you could hope for there are people

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,260
who are organized around being

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,450
that's what they like they should be

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,490
allowed to do that you know but there

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,570
are also very inclusive communities and

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,640
there are technologies that are

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,890
relatively easy to acquire and do

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,500
interesting things with so you guys are

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,520
in good places for this is there

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,990
anything else that you want to say about

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,699
the movie is there anything else you

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,520
guys want to ask her does anybody got a

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,610
question yeah I'm happy yeah yeah okay

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,760
we've got do we have a runner does

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:27,250
somebody want to be a runner cool here's

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,720
that here's the microphone run away we

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,210
were gonna find one of these but I guess

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,970
it didn't happen thank you very much

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:37,020
raise your hand if you have a question

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,310
there we go way to step up sister huh

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,630
sorry I was about to leave to go get

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,390
more water but you were like questions

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,060
so yeah yeah so

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,380
for I know it you said you like think

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,910
it's important for everyone to have a

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,950
group and like I definitely agree with

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,960
that but how do you feel about like

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:57,580
really hateful groups having their own

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,870
space like rad fans or meninist s-- so

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm not talking about those types of

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,940
groups you know and I know the debate

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,310
you write about you know freedom of

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,140
speech and and I'm a huge you know hello

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,000
freedom of speech a speech advocate but

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,710
that's not really the context in which I

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,450
was talking I was I was talking more

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,920
about you know specifically met when you

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,930
say men's groups right what do you mean

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,910
right there there is this like in

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,150
Claire's situation this is a men's

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,310
rights group that is out to oppress

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,220
women because they are threatened by you

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,840
know women's rise but there's lots of

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,610
amazing men's groups that I think are

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,010
fantastic and then you know want those

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,720
types of communities too so I personally

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,920
support all of those but certainly there

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,300
are hate groups and I absolutely

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,890
hundred-percent do not support those

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,960
right so you like support groups that

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,120
support other people not groups that

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,480
seek to take down all right yeah that's

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,010
a really you said it better than me okay

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,290
thank you for that is there another

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,170
question yeah actually I had one no but

00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:03,430
let me give the mic up go ahead you can

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:05,410
do it I just wondered basically if there

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,490
are particularly open source projects

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:12,790
that are seeking to have contributors

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,730
that are more diverse like women people

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,230
of color stuff like that and shout out

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,640
mother yeah off the top of my head

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,320
Drupal okay very very very welcoming

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,520
node to a certain extent it's easy to

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,070
apprehend and there was a lot of

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,970
marginalized representation there are

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,830
you good anybody got another one

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:37,480
WordPress that was the anti Drupal

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:40,630
WordPress also Joomla as long as we're

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,700
here talking about not to diss anybody

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,190
ever right I mean I think that there are

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,560
lots of opportunity there are some

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,810
really old school things like Debian and

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,360
Apache that Debian has done a pretty

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,550
good job of having Debian women really

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,389
mean something Apache has tried a couple

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,879
times and there's

00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,039
attempt right now going on to coalesce

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:01,989
you know a female energy and into a

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,709
discussion group so it's good what's

00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:08,859
worth supporting that too Andy so one of

00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:10,899
the things with the VC money and the and

00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:13,979
the other is there is sort of this if

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:19,779
you get VC money you move to California

00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:23,229
and it seems to me that if you're not

00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:26,200
from wealth or if you are from if you've

00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:28,029
got kids what have you that that's from

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,349
you if at least it wasn't that wasn't an

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:32,559
option

00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:36,190
so what what about Geographic I guess

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,839
diversity and inclusion since we're all

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:43,269
here on the yeah right I think that I

00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:47,469
think the future is bright I need some

00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:50,440
shades trying to be oh no no I'm

00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:51,820
optimistic actually because I was just

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,149
talking to some people this morning

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,079
about what's been somewhat I you know

00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,429
there's things I love about the valley

00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,599
but there's been a bit of an exodus from

00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:02,829
the valley of talent and dollars because

00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,209
people do want to live where they want

00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:06,700
to live they don't want to necessarily

00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:09,909
subscribe to that culture right and so I

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,200
think that there are hubs there's always

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,789
been incubators right in different

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,729
cities but I actually see a lot more

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:18,879
investment dollars being represented

00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:22,959
through hubs and like Denver rally

00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:25,509
Atlanta what's that Philadelphia Delphia

00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:27,099
so I think that I think that we're

00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,369
seeing an evolution where it's spreading

00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:32,829
around the country when in context of

00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,690
United States right so I think that's

00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:36,999
changing although like Elena's story

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,139
right she said if I raise money this VC

00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,029
I'm gonna have to me about the valley

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,979
it's not for me certainly I think that's

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,379
still a reality but I think I think it's

00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:46,059
changing slowly I will say that in

00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:47,829
Ireland I'm working pretty hard to get

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,839
that country to set up its own VC

00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:52,599
mmm-hmm structure and because I saw that

00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,070
successfully done in Sri Lanka for

00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,190
island nations it's actually pretty easy

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,869
to set up your own government subsidized

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,019
fund and I think it's worth doing

00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,849
because again if if the fact that the

00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,079
money's all in America and maybe a

00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:08,220
little in London although who knows

00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,350
what's about to happen to that they

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,970
you know you don't want your best and

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,129
brightest to leave you'd like them to be

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,840
able to stay home right right and you'd

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,580
like people to get it that it's not that

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,250
glamorous to move to America I've done

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,409
tons of talks in India that you watch me

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,299
do when please don't plan on coming to

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:27,629
America you're really not gonna like it

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,990
right but of course that's that's what

00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:32,399
that's the dream so it's hard it's hard

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,200
okay anybody else with a question these

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:36,419
are great questions by the way it looks

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,309
like yeah we got mics over there but

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,980
it'll come to you next

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:44,159
yeah so I work for IndieGoGo which is

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,769
the company that was the platform for

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,240
the Roar project and it's really cool to

00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:50,490
see it but you know we're actually

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,769
incentivized just the exact same way as

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,659
the VCS and it's actually been really

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:58,769
challenging to be a platform for

00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,480
projects that maybe just from an

00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:03,450
economic incentive perspective like

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,190
don't make us the most money so you know

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,570
it's cool to see like oh crowdfunding

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,970
can solve a lot of problems for

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:12,419
communities community fundraising but

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,460
like how do you see the platform's being

00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:18,029
able to move forward when like a lot of

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,669
the economic incentives are against you

00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,169
know just you know not doing drones all

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:23,549
the time or not doing whatever the

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:27,019
hopping is that can make the most money

00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:30,509
yet another coffee maker yeah

00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:33,659
earbuds I mean my thoughts are that

00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:36,000
those platforms with all of that said

00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,649
are still doing a lot of good I don't

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,470
think that when we talk about women

00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,730
going alternate routes for funding I

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,960
don't think crowdsourcing is the only

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,000
way that they're going alternate routes

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,860
right like women are doing a lot of

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,419
bootstrapping

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,279
they're raising money from you know

00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,830
friends and family more often than men

00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,179
um but I you know it sounds like you're

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,950
more the expert on the platforms than I

00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,100
am but I wouldn't discount them I still

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,350
think they add a lot of value for

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,950
entrepreneurs and particularly

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,049
minorities there's a really great

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,320
platform in the film space called seed

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,480
and spark it's amazing it's amazing and

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,610
it helps you know women and women of

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,940
color filmmakers to raise money and

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,200
distribute their pieces and I think that

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,789
will say there's so many now right

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,710
there's so many niche platforms for

00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,640
crowdfunding that I think maybe that's

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,510
maybe

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,310
I don't know to be interesting to hear

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,500
your perspective you know afterwards but

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,630
like maybe that's the evolution is is

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,910
the focus yeah I actually had that in my

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,670
question so I'm really glad you asked it

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,900
but my here's my thought how many of you

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,070
guys know about the difference between

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,380
lyft and over anybody yeah so uber you

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,050
know what do Burress lyft is actually

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,460
the first company that had that idea

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,950
also founded in San Francisco before

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,950
over but the guys that founded it were

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,930
trying to get cars off the streets in

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,580
San Francisco that was their goal so

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,320
they organized as a public benefit

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,840
corporation instead of a for-profit

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,310
classic for profit so that doesn't mean

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,770
they can lose money can you know

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,600
year-on-year and still survive but it

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,760
does mean that as a charter their

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,930
requirement is to serve the community

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,940
not the bank and that is a really

00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,650
interesting idea I'd love to see a crown

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,130
foot crowdfunding platform that's set up

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,540
that way

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,730
I mean IndieGoGo it's already better

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,760
than Kickstarter because you guys pay

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,740
even on a partial raise and that was

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,180
really a good innovation but I think if

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,250
we could go a little further with that

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,620
because it does seem like we're falling

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,510
back on self funding through

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,880
crowdfunding for things like health

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,010
crazy right and you know everything

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,240
pretty much okay there was another

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,440
question over here can the mic make it

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,900
okay perfect sorry

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,300
okay so Jennifer my question is for you

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,300
it's about the topic of this particular

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,580
video so it says the power of community

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,770
and one thing that I noticed that was

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,410
common amongst most of the interviewees

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:58,050
was that they were founders or

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,430
consultants or entrepreneurs and as an

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,160
individual contributor in a large

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,780
company I think that a lot of times when

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,370
I hear these kinds of stories that's

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,620
like the goal is to be on the M track

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,680
and the goal is to be either that or be

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,110
an entrepreneur and I don't want to do

00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,600
either of those things and I also think

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,480
that defining leadership in that way and

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,030
defining like community you have to you

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,360
know be a founder to be able to make a

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:26,790
space I think is discouraging personally

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,190
yes I just that's that's really fair and

00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:31,560
I think in another episode we can

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,240
explore that in this one I chose Clare

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,320
and Yasmine because I wanted to show two

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,539
women who

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,929
built something from scratch and then

00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,120
had something or someone basically

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:43,380
threatened taking it all the way down

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,090
and so that's why I chose them for this

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,830
particular episode as I needed that kind

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,320
of like I created this thing that's

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,759
amazing and because I'm a woman it's

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,320
gonna like go away but valid valid point

00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,049
I have lots of friends who are not

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,000
looking to be entrepreneurs or even

00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,080
necessarily executive management and I

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,500
think in fact I think that's the

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,000
majority of women in tech right and so

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,320
very valid point and I think that those

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,559
stories are represented throughout the

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,690
series ok this is gonna be the last

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,120
question for this section but she's

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,710
gonna be back for the panel so if you

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,539
have a burning question you can ask it

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:24,870
during the panel I just have to stay on

00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:28,110
time god I'm sorry everybody I wanted to

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:31,740
return to the funding subject because

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:35,100
it's important for increasing the women

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:38,490
in tech as well what is the role of

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:42,870
government and international institution

00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:45,899
on the encouraging both organizations

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:49,950
and funding companies or supporting

00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:52,559
women in tech that wasn't in the video I

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,320
hope it was in the second or third

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,409
episode but I'm asking you

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,460
yeah what have you seen thank you so I

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,679
haven't went really deep on that

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,009
research so I all I can do I can't give

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,649
you date can't give you the data or the

00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:11,279
facts in response to your question but I

00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:13,049
can tell you that business does perform

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,809
better with diverse workforces which

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,960
includes women right and society as a

00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:20,100
result benefits and so I think

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,200
government participation and

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,559
contribution to this is really important

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,879
and we see that in some of what I was

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,769
called a more progressive countries

00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:34,080
around the world and I think that it's

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:36,120
having a good impact so I say yes I say

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,220
yeah it's more of that please I would

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,279
like to say that the Grameen Bank which

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,919
was the first micro loan bank set itself

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,480
up to only loan to women now and they

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,169
did that because women are the ones who

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,509
will actually pay back

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:53,019
and actually invest in the local economy

00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:54,820
rather than blowing the money you know

00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:57,399
you guys have all seen Silicon Valley

00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,139
you know how that works by the way if

00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,869
you haven't seen Silicon Valley that is

00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:03,820
e for dr. yu drama I'm here to tell you

00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:05,379
people think that it's outlandish every

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,299
time I watch it I turn to my husband I

00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:10,960
go wow I just did that in a meeting yeah

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:15,659
you know anyway I think that there's a

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:18,340
there's an acknowledged pattern among I

00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:19,929
would bet I was gonna try to come up

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,899
with an adjective beneficial is coming

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,970
up but among the lenders who are being

00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:28,149
humanists and not just trying to get

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,470
their 30% return you know in two in fact

00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,599
two and a half years which isn't even

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,999
possible anymore but the VCS are still

00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,039
trying to do that so it's gonna have to

00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,659
change it has because they can't get

00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,019
what they wanted out of it anymore

00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:42,519
so hopefully governments will step in

00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,229
although it's going to take a different

00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,519
administration for our government to do

00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:48,609
that

00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,950
anybody else oh I sorry I already said

00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:53,080
we couldn't all right hold on hold on to

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,450
your questions for the panel it's time

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,989
for another little break we're going to

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,019
come back it is 4:18 we're gonna come

00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:03,999
back at 4:30 so twelve minutes and we'll

00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:07,619
have a half an hour of everybody up here

00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:07,619
and you guys can ask us all questions

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,010
