[Music]

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,710
all right hi everyone thank you for

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,809
having us

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,119
I'm gonna do a really quick introduction

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,740
of myself my name is Adrian Michelle I'm

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,349
actually a licensed Marriage and Family

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,360
Therapist so I'm Way out of my element

00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:28,320
here but we're not gonna do anything for

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,800
you today I promise you yes yes and I'm

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,750
Brittany Glover I am a product manager

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,790
educator I'm also teach middle to high

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,170
school students how to code and I'll

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,899
tell you more about my journey

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,030
intentionally later but that is who I am

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,739
and together we represent intersections

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,329
yes so just a little bit about

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,579
intersections we're a diversity and

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,230
inclusion company and we do things a

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,789
little bit differently you know how

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,920
sometimes you go to diversity and

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,149
inclusion meetings and they show you

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,969
pictures of this because this is how

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,120
they want your office to look maybe it's

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,420
like this holding hands like this is how

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,090
we get work done right or maybe we make

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,340
a weird circle like that's it's totally

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,680
cool it's cool but like what kind of

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,350
action steps do they actually give to

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,960
make the company diverse and inclusive

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,310
and a lot of times in companies they say

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,869
well we don't need to talk about

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,420
everything we just need to put the

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,780
puzzle pieces together what I don't work

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,060
right it does not work so let's just be

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,259
honest we're not holding things up we're

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,430
trying to sit and have a conversation

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,740
but it mostly feels like this right like

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,479
how are we supposed to have an active

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,520
conversation about diversity and

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,880
inclusion without diverse and inclusive

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,750
people in the room right and really talk

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,149
about what we can do to change things so

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,700
really quickly I want to say this quote

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,490
because when we design inclusivity we

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,930
elevate the experience for everyone not

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,310
just the people who are Vernal boards so

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,549
we're not talking about just making

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,259
things great for one community or one

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,180
marginalized group it's better for

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,250
everybody right I know when I can feel

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,740
myself when I can be myself

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,780
I do my work better right I have better

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,450
skills I'm able to connect with people

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,490
more and so realistically this change

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,870
about diversity inclusion it needs to be

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,310
for everyone again I wanted to put a

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,780
number out here because I figured you

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,430
all might respond

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,830
well two numbers right and so when we

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,840
look at diversity and inclusion 30%

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,080
that's the number right there needs to

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,540
be about 30% of the critical mass when

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,209
minority groups voices start to feel

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,060
heard right and so just let that sink in

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,730
what what are we doing at 30% at work

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,940
besides working right besides social

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,350
media maybe are we really focused on the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,700
diversity and inclusion within the

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:53,340
company so the question is what is your

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,290
office culture right what is your

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,750
company culture what does that look like

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,209
how is it described to you is it updated

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,519
on a quarterly basis are you doing

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,980
health checks right to check-in for

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,870
people like myself rate who started Web

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,940
Design web development product

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,470
management right to check in with those

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,050
minorities and actually really

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,260
understand how they feel so the question

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,850
proposed again is what is your office

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,610
culture and that's the question I want

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,739
you to take throughout this talk and how

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,269
do people find out about it right like

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,070
it's kind of like meeting your partner

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,170
or meet your partner's families you're

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,420
gonna say oh my aunt likes to drink a

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,459
little bit more or you might say a

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,959
little something to prepare them but

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,250
when I come into an office space I want

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,410
to know that y'all have lunch every

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,360
Thursday right I want to know what kind

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,450
of jokes y'all you know make around the

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,829
office I want to know things about the

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,989
culture of this space and are they

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,970
inclusive right are they incorporating

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,100
and valuing everyone's honor system

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,320
right can you create a shared honor

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,130
system that actually works for everyone

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,400
okay so what I love most about my career

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,290
aid is I started about 12 years ago and

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,299
one of my first big job someone came up

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,940
to me in the coffee room and they said

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,700
hey you have five things against she

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,549
right and I was like what is this person

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,560
about to say like literally like what

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,910
could you say to me as a newbie that

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,310
would make me feel included

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,320
well the items are right there right

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,100
they said you had five things against

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:27,750
you you're young black gay and a female

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,270
in aunty I was 21 I mean of course I've

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,240
been a high school college but what does

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,729
that actually mean to me right

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,249
almost like someone else looking on the

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,770
outside of my life I'm on the inside

00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:44,009
looking back and you're actually telling

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,139
me these five things now these aren't

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,569
things necessarily your parents that

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,819
sorry have told you along the way right

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,430
it's not like anyone pulls you aside and

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:58,439
says like hey friendly reminder you're

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,870
black right a friendly reminder that

00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,339
you're gay

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,529
maybe friendly reminder that I

00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,330
personally think from the outside did

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,180
all these things really don't add up

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,639
they don't add up to me right but that

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,620
isn't my experience this is someone from

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,189
the third side stepping in and saying

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,469
this is what you look like to me so how

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,629
do we actually take that right how would

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,610
you take that statement if you pick five

00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,740
things about you right you put them on

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,589
the board would you want someone else to

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,639
repeat that back to you constantly the

00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,379
answer probably not right and using this

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,569
intersectional perspective right this

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,069
person even just being a young person is

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,029
going to be treated differently being a

00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,449
black person might be treated

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,740
differently gay female and an item to be

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,529
treated differently like let's be real

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,689
and so you don't come in with just one

00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,370
of these identities right like it's not

00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,289
like you're saying like you don't see

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,459
color if I stole these projectors right

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,259
on out of here you'd be like some black

00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,180
girl came in here and stole he's

00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,370
protected you wouldn't be like oh this

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,589
this very ordinary person well

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,779
professional just can't I don't know I

00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,199
can't tell you don't see color I don't

00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,330
know

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,959
that wouldn't happen right so let's be

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,309
realistic about the experiences there's

00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,069
somebody with these identities are gonna

00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:17,490
hold right so ultimately in this case

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:20,009
right I become your wildcard ultimately

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,809
you've told me those five things I'm 21

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,610
I'm walking through a whole career that

00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:25,919
I'm excited about and you're saying

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,490
guess what you are a wild card

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,439
and what No so what that actually really

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,209
means right is you're telling me that I

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,599
don't add up in any of these four card

00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:39,959
squadrons I'm pink maybe I'm orange

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,059
maybe I'm a fair skinned black person

00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,680
right so you put me somewhere else in

00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:46,649
the middle of that of values that

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,439
society has created that are backed by

00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,110
what what are they backed by right

00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,509
so I step in I'm your wildcard for many

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,389
reasons and instead of this seeing this

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,249
it's like shades of everything you want

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,379
me to go within one of those four places

00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:04,139
right but I'm already those five things

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,239
yeah and even with a wild card right

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,889
wild card sounds like it's really fun

00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,259
but let's call it what it is a diversity

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,869
hire but like what are you doing to make

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,119
that person feel included in this space

00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:15,539
right and so when we talk about the wild

00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,219
card

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,979
let's just be real is the wild card

00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:22,079
trusted right is the wild card gonna be

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,509
the person that you trust to lead your

00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,779
organization or lead some activities or

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,729
programs are they gonna be seen are you

00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,979
going to actually listen to them

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,129
Rea um I think we have time for a really

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,959
quick story I work a lot in working with

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,059
companies and going in and telling them

00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,649
about whatever they might need right we

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,610
surveyed the company to say hey do you

00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,169
need gender and sexual diversity

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,449
education do you need to learn about

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,939
microaggressions intersectionality

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,409
identities it goes on and so I went to

00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,079
this tech company and this woman kept

00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:54,209
saying to me hey I see this person go in

00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,679
the men's bathroom out of the women's

00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,599
bathroom and we're here to talk about

00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,009
gender and sexual diversity I need to

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,379
know what's going on with this bathroom

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,300
situation and I said lady how much time

00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,289
are you spending watching this person go

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,449
into our bathroom

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,399
once you just get a gender-neutral

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,869
bathroom so that somebody doesn't have

00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,979
to stress about it it's the most

00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,839
important you can get your work done

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,849
because it seems like this person is

00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,159
doing just fine just using the restroom

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,589
right and so it's about taking the

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,659
intention back with your organization

00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,639
what you're actually doing to make it

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,989
inclusive and as we talked about that we

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,659
can't talk about it without talking

00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:28,679
about microaggressions right

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,149
microaggressions sometimes we talk about

00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:32,189
them like they're little mosquito bites

00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,110
but once you get a bunch of them you're

00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:36,180
irritated maybe you don't want to be at

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,610
work right if somebody keeps commenting

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,469
on how I'm different I may not want to

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,699
go and so even if we talk about what's

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,469
going on with the Supreme Court right

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:46,800
now right can you be fired for being

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:49,050
LGBTQ well I inspire organizations to

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,189
take a pledge for their employees you're

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,040
not going to be fired for these

00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:55,709
identities right regardless and so it's

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,509
about taking the employees and making

00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,620
them feel like they can have trust in

00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:02,339
the company that they're working for

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,360
because you care yes and also with that

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,670
right Mike

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,950
regressions a lot of us say like what is

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,500
it really right the person I said those

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,990
five things they weren't a bad person

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,760
they were just like hey there's a

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,170
difference I see it I don't know if you

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,690
see it but maybe you need to see it

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,640
right dad ain't telling me that

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,040
information didn't necessarily help me

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,200
be the best me in those career moves so

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,390
imagine just like those bug bites you

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,000
start with that right that is your

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,890
starting place maybe two years down the

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,500
road also a lot of things in the middle

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,200
someone says you look like you live

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,470
paycheck to paycheck right and at that

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,260
time I was actually launching about two

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,959
startups and working almost 24 hours

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,990
right so it wasn't the course of any of

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,310
that so really like hearing these things

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,820
but also knowing who I am

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:56,010
that didn't add up to that right fast

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,930
forward years later we're all jumping in

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,680
they go to lunch right and someone says

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,579
wow nice card is this a rental are you

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,470
leasing it right these are really

00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,779
serious things instead of understanding

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,220
that hey actually this person may go out

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,579
on a Saturday morning and clean their

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,079
own car right

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:19,019
fast-forward years later from that you

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,029
have examples that say hey you've worked

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,380
with us for so long it made your hair

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:27,240
straight no I have natural hair I can

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,100
stretch this pull it all the way out to

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,430
here right I can look different every

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,970
day

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,220
I'd hate skirts back up to another micro

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,190
regression right

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,529
you don't wear skirts what does that

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,019
actually mean what does that mean coming

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,630
from an employer what does that mean

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,149
coming from your boss how do I have to

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,940
constantly change to fit into that box

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,920
right so remember I'm the wild card now

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,560
but I also understand that these

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,660
experiences are consistent and it stops

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,550
you from being able to adequately finish

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,050
your job right I got to be irritated

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,620
about that car comment like this is my

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,220
car

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,250
don't you or don't worry about my hair

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,019
right if we don't have we do a exercise

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,819
in our trainings about shared identities

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,860
we don't share an identity how about you

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,779
don't comment on it unless I start

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,250
talking about it right and so that's a

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,530
really quick and easy

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,480
way to help companies figure out okay

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,640
well we have these things happening well

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,170
we can fix it because a successful

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,150
company has retention

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,770
it has sustainability right that's a

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,630
successful company and that includes

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,730
making sure that your employees feel

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,320
good

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,360
so another microaggression I'll

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,550
definitely add into that right during

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,700
the first week of one job I was brought

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,830
in and taken off the lunch sat down and

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,140
they said what is your experience like

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,270
being black a lot of black people are

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:54,060
being killed right now and I'm not Aires

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:56,100
my kids serious statement hurry so how

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,840
do you handle these conversations and

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,020
how are you standing up for the people

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,510
that are stuck in these conversations

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,580
right so we head over to education

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,890
promotes understanding right and this is

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,870
literally about bridging the gap in the

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,270
ways that you can we're not asking you

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,730
to jump to jump through all of these

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,750
hoops right and get to 100% tomorrow

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,800
we're asking you to strive to 30% create

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,020
KPIs

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,800
okay ours that allow you to achieve

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,810
these goals but also understand that the

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,350
current state today looks a lot like

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,710
this

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,470
we have exclusion you hire me I'm your

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,240
token black person to be honest maybe

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,150
other identities come in that look like

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,670
me maybe they don't because I am that

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,810
person in that picture that says we've

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,320
checked it all right

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,710
so as I stand here in exclusion mood I'm

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,140
not adding any value to your company

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,720
you're not listening to me right not

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,330
being heard heard the first time perhaps

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,930
add another micro regression then pay me

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:03,510
two weeks to step away and consider what

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:07,020
has happened great so you're paying me

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,630
to be silent for your company values

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,710
right so still on the side I'm in that

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,740
exclusion mode

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,920
I believe that as people where we all

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,290
want to be is integration is nice it

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,589
means you're in the room your vote

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,240
counts but we're still a little unsure

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:29,040
right because you're still in that

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,840
bubble to make it worse I'm still 5% of

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,840
that 30% we need

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,390
so although we may see five-plus here

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,520
the reality is not like that

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,710
so when we break it down into inclusion

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,230
which is what we're striving for it when

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,230
we say create these company cultures

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,140
these values that matter it has to be

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,190
inclusive if you have culture committee

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,260
meetings right

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,960
that people aren't represented in that

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,910
you're trying to serve whose voices are

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,930
you really listening to if you're not

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,060
measuring that what is it based on so

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,070
today I think we really challenge you to

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,570
just take this information keep it in

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,110
the back of your head for your next

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,960
meeting it's not necessarily that again

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,680
we expect tomorrow that you're great

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,600
this is progress

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,839
and this is also where we fall forward

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,160
and so moving forward in the culture

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,779
shift right what does it like to change

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,730
the culture shift we'll check your bias

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,380
right start thinking about or even

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,330
having your organization bring speakers

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,520
and to talk about what bias looks like

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,600
how do we know when we have privilege

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,250
what is oppression what is

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,410
microaggressions right work with

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,120
intention be intentional around what

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,770
you're doing are you celebrating all the

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,990
holidays right are you talking about

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,210
mental health in the office right are

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,020
you talking about being LGBTQ do you

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,700
have like POC or bi POC groups right

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,470
some of you look at night those are a

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,450
lot of letters that I've heard about

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,420
right but being mindful that people of

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,290
color also need spaces and so also the

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,910
term fall forward yes again I think it's

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,820
really important the last thing I'll add

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,280
there right is know that we create these

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,640
agile systems and it works just the same

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,530
you have retros implement it keep it

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,600
going create those key performance

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,670
indicators hey we know that if we can

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,490
make it here in this quarter this also

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,920
shows people like me and IT that you're

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,360
striving towards excellence there even

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,160
though you may not be there but

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,160
ultimately we're going to make mistakes

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,230
those five things weren't bad how we

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,450
come back from those things and what's

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,520
that afterwards yeah if someone says

00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,709
that every minute there's something

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,200
different right my screw agressions

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:39,839
versus fall for it let's make a better

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,940
effort next time right so thank you so

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,290
much for having us here at all things

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,700
open we really appreciate the

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,980
opportunity if you're looking

00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,390
any education support or just speakers

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,150
to come in and talk through what that

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,580
looks like or consultations we're here

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,350
for you so we are intersections a

00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,530
diversity and inclusion company thank

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,560
you thank you so much

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:06,559
