Description: 
	Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool for declaratively building and maintaining complex infrastructures on one or more cloud providers/services. But Terraform also supports over 80 non-infrastructure providers! In this demo-driven talk, will dive into the internals of Terraform and see how it works. We will show how Terraform can be used for non-infrastructure use cases by showing examples. Weâ€™ll also take a look at on how you can extend Terraform to manage anything with an API.
