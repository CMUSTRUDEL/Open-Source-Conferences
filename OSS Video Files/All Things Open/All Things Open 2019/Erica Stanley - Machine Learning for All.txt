Title: Erica Stanley - Machine Learning for All
Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	As we hear more and more about Machine Learning, few web developers have actually had the opportunity to use it in production. It seems like you have to have years of Data Science, Statistics or AI education to even understand how to start. While some prerequisite education is needed to get you started, itâ€™s not as much as you might think and there are collections of libraries to help along the way. This session will give a brief introduction to Machine Learning, delve into the libraries that make it possible and discuss our lessons learned from evolving our machine learning efforts from prototype to production at SalesLoft.

[Music]

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,849
okay so you around we're not gonna

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,089
Prince the stage Derek this time the

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,539
Erica is made engineer that sales lump

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:24,210
is unbelievably activity hounds and

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:27,060
texting anyone found him all right

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,410
and also is a fantastic have a bit of

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,410
diversity please

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,049
[Applause]

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,540
[Applause]

00:00:42,920 --> 00:01:12,119
I always loved so always just love this

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:15,929
conference and just waiting and I don't

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,420
have tons of random Nations or even

00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:20,490
fortunately unless came here to hear who

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,970
recommendation there plan and then lived

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,970
here for about ten years or so awesome

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,780
why is important to learn and get

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,360
involved with machinery and how anyone

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,140
can started with or without an advanced

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,140
degree in science or math or statistics

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:52,920
both degree student help they serve you

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:55,500
know curve but we won't everyone that so

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,880
let's take a look at the wasted

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,359
opportunity news arrives so how many

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:09,149
people use some kind of navigation to

00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,700
make some additional center navigation

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,379
service

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,110
nine days of exactly we're experiencing

00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,909
so we'll have contain this stuff step

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,099
further to predict more time and less

00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,409
tables especially in areas that have a

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,129
service already so they're using a

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:27,109
combination of time this is travel and

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,359
individual that's asked part of their

00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:32,299
day sex and the house equals PI

00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:36,290
electrons for each anticipated stop or

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:38,989
reduction is eat or a reason and to

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,930
capture a lot of unique properties of a

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,730
specific streets or neighborhoods they

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,639
don't want to learn how the other

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:53,450
plantation for areas of their size of

00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:56,750
the timeline for the units operate so

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,609
that's one way we all have someone

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,010
trying to sell us something without him

00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:07,489
stating where this price was at all

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:10,010
their lives and us forgive me my land

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,790
side simply because the self persons

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,560
need to know us all so well and I had

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,769
perfectly ridiculousness

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,840
I have a good friend that really gets

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:26,209
followed by the internet I feel like

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,870
they're enduring the differences itself

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,449
personalization I already felt locked

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,099
Stephanie in Atlanta and recently work

00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,430
on our first machine learning English

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,290
and find adventure our goal was to help

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,780
our customers care of their messages

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,540
there

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,709
leads and customers based on your top

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,750
function in seniority so we're going our

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,510
own day Center talk to you a little bit

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,000
about the strongest base there and we'll

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,870
be in the u.s. taking a simplified

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
version of rules and hiding from women

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,400
and then our whole classification and

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:12,080
then we have this where you classic

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:12,080
where one about relationships dissociate

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:24,019
now LS leukemia has place for mangoes or

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,149
[Music]

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,200
when he ate keywords and tags and how

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,930
this relates to Hawks a pheromone one

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,120
and also the other frequency of those

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,820
keyword mentioned so nice and hot

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,620
popular up to know companies and then

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,620
it's permanent ask America

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,790
so what we do she needs to gather on the

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,910
streets and post using certain analysis

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:55,850
to help expand that research to make

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:58,720
money or see professor so then text is

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,300
the start of Independence the text is a

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,010
social miss new tool that defies

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,830
influencers Institute at workspace or

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,500
search terms these words the index forms

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,170
Collette Stenger's of a shotgun fighting

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,070
exactly the reinforcer the right message

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,190
at the right time

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,380
what didn't you used to stay on if you

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,850
might all the data that we're getting

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,730
from social media to help this doctor

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,710
understand and after the data make sense

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,200
of the data that you seen about these

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,460
rare diseases so there's so many uses

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:38,480
for machine learning in ways that

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:41,540
hello hey guys all the systems not far

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,800
off technology of the future is here

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,380
Ami's that wolf is for everyday lives

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,620
and that sources can be pro maybe she

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,680
went pretty much to laser energy as

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,710
constants how music system but it must

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,780
be a kind so seamless Emily may not

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,370
always understand the ways that she dies

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,260
so let's for some reason to leave the

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,020
night give obviously involved foolish

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,180
dream first of all how many of us I 21

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,100
challenges how many of us actually work

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,410
well something that time that became so

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,070
she ready his allowing producers to do

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:28,280
they they have never done before and so

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:31,100
completely that she also Jesus are doing

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,080
about diversity anybody have more

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,170
perspective a wider range of

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,560
perspectives create more useful

00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:46,430
solutions and then there's also a place

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:49,400
if you don't know and as people are

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,790
involved with evaluation or any kind of

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,320
right systems it is you know soon

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,200
they're gonna do the right guy today's

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,390
we learn a protective the mind or it

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
evolved and you make sure that our

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:06,730
interests and our communicators are

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,730
group when they rule out

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:14,349
and so listen uh some ways to make this

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,940
accessible to everyone right so first

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,849
thing I wanna think about is the

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,789
mystifying kind of machinery

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:26,139
I think a lot of people even they must

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:28,330
meet several degrees get involved get

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,430
started Lucien right and just kind of

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,750
saying registrated if you don't we

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,630
occasionally get an office you this

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,769
whole reality of a bit of a step to

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,769
start this assignment

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:51,730
and so a lot of people doesn't right now

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,279
and I think sometimes we're not super

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,620
involved in understand what it means and

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,690
so just want to copy the terminology so

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,060
artificial intelligence it's pretty much

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:12,690
of you working or algorithms or set

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:15,550
about those amazing and that's about

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,430
artificial entities and it's a method of

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,730
training so that you learn to make

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:25,570
decisions of deep learning is from

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,610
murder something machinery and so in the

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,279
same way that because our brain switch

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,079
happens they classify certain types of

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,540
information we need to also be used

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:40,510
where it's committed back to making

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:43,360
process as a distinct group she learning

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:47,860
relates to our background is as diffuse

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,589
and in others and in traditional for

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:55,180
ready now you'll see that things appear

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:57,820
and neatness as other programs on sexual

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,240
zakah that you and it which to get back

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:05,459
are the answers base for how those move

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,459
for meanwhile today make sense

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,350
[Music]

00:10:44,150 --> 00:11:20,120
and so I learned from our time our

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,950
integer so this is the first time to

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,660
productize something from our days I see

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:30,440
and so there was a lot of kind of you

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,440
want to persist

00:12:12,070 --> 00:13:07,900
yeah there's a lot and were they

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,900
important

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,419
[Music]

00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:14,850
it's not like some ways to be starting a

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:17,280
foundation foundational concepts in

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:22,700
spirit bulbs works getting involved in a

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,700
lot machine out there

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:38,560
it's awesome and in a spirit of openness

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,180
here are a few projects that can kind of

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,899
start with who would think they're ready

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:48,100
price to be using every occasion but

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:55,529
also trying to treat I've been working

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:55,529
with is predicting the homes of people

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,129
[Applause]

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,129
