Title: Navya Solkhan – So You Want Your Daughter to be a Technologist…What now?
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Do you want to inspire your daughter, sister, niece or a girl to learn Technology? Are you wondering how to give them the early exposure and spark their interest and curiosity? With no prior STEM or coding experience, my friends and I built a mobile app as part of a global Technology challenge. This led to us winning the 2018 Congressional App Challenge for the Triangle area NC District 4. Come hear my journey on the mobile product development, the different opportunities for girls, and finding the right mentorship and role models. This session will also address the usual Technology myths that discourage some kids and how you can support and foster their interest in Technology.

[Music]

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,060
good afternoon everyone my name is Nadia

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
silken I am currently a sophomore at

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,680
Green level high school and today I will

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,590
be speaking on how you can inspire girls

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:32,649
to become technologists by sharing my

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,600
journey but before that let's look at

00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,090
some of the myths surrounding technology

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,950
which are the reasons why only a small

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,010
percentage of girls pursue it

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,239
first being that you have to code to be

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,579
in technology there's a stereotype that

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,890
technology is only all day coding since

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,010
a young age science and math classes are

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,190
predominantly male or it's not seen as

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,980
cool to excel in math and science or

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,870
math as a girl the modern definition of

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,629
working and Technology covers many

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,420
different careers such as data analysts

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,450
to product managers it's all inclusive

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,540
so while coding is certainly a part of

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,899
technology it is only one aspect of it

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,500
a second belief is that technology is

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:22,659
not creative the latest devices trends

00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,570
and technologies are by their very

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,520
nature exciting and stimulating

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,399
creations I'm sure that everyone here

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,350
can attest to this working in technology

00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:34,479
you have the opportunity to learn and

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,149
explore brand new cutting-edge

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,430
procedures and technologies that pace

00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,140
assures you you never get bored with

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,719
what you're doing and have the

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,240
opportunity to explore explore new and

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,909
creative ideas a user experience

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,890
designer a product owner and a business

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,140
analysts are all technologists because

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,229
they all deal with technology in their

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,380
day to day life many careers are part of

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,390
technology and they are all creative the

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,840
third and final myth is the notion that

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,990
STEM resources are available equally to

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,720
girls and boys this might be the MIT

00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,850
that we hear most often multiple studies

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,220
have proven that girls begin to turn

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,620
away from tech in middle school because

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,540
finding instruction becomes harder the

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,220
available courses are not suited to the

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,220
way they learn and there's a lack of

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,310
mentors encouraging them to to

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,190
participate

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,500
it's not the girls lack interest it said

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,480
they lack a way to access programs where

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:42,410
they could succeed and gain an interest

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:43,970
in technology this point leads into my

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,640
journey and the programs that I

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,680
participated to get here talking at this

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,349
technology conference in front of you

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,630
all my journey started with a challenge

00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:56,030
called just for girls called tuck the

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,790
Technovation challenge it is a global

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,549
competition that equips young woman to

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,290
become tech entrepreneurs and leaders

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,019
with the support of volunteer mentors

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,940
such as teachers or parents girls work

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,640
in teams to code mobile apps that

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,769
address real-world problems I had an

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,380
amazing time working with my friends and

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,330
my parents who were a mentors to create

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,580
an app that would help teens in our

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:25,160
community we created an app called

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,410
ripples ripples is a digital platform

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,109
where volunteers and event coordinators

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,299
can connect this way volunteers can

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,239
easily find volunteering opportunities

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,060
without joining big organizations which

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,640
don't have the capacity to accommodate

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,829
so many volunteers anyways and event

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,829
coordinators can find volunteers easily

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,420
we can we have made this app an app

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,480
where the whole process has been

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,930
digitalized our team was one of the 200

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
teams selected for the semi-finalists

00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,489
semi-finals out of the 2,000 teams

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,380
globally we entered this the same app

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,900
into another mobile app development

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,239
competition the congressional options

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,950
the House of Representatives hosts

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,959
district-wide congressional app

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,389
challenges from middle school and high

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,639
school students encouraging them to

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:19,190
learn to code and inspiring them to

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,650
pursue careers in computer science our

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,780
team won the congressional app challenge

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,090
in the Triangle area district and got

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,280
the opportunity to go to Washington DC

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,520
and display our apps in the Capitol

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,520
building

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,250
I'm currently a student ambassador for

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,190
both Technovation and the Congressional

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,710
app challenge my job now is to encourage

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,990
girls in my community to participate in

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,910
these challenges I have visited a few

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,670
schools in the Triangle area to spread

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,580
the word my talk here is a continuation

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,770
of that effort I'm also in the process

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,930
of creating a professional version of my

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,660
app which will be available on the Apple

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,450
and Android App Store in the in a couple

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,770
of weeks I am acting as a product owner

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,310
and working with the team of

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,340
professional developers to create the

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,980
app as part of being a product owner I

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,230
am guiding requirements prioritizing

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,540
them and testing the app as it is being

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,060
developed I have gotten all of these

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,990
opportunities just by participating in

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:34,800
one competition and with the opportunity

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:38,080
leading to another as I mentioned before

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,790
my Technovation journey previously this

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,640
is some more information on the program

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,010
like who can participate key dates and

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,140
the support they offer the challenge is

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,660
to create an app which solves a problem

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,330
in your community girls ages 10 to 18

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,910
can participate and no prior coding

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,340
experience is needed registration for

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,620
the challenge has now opened and the

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,650
deadline for the submission is in April

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,260
Technovation also offer offers a 12-week

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,540
curriculum on their website and local or

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,250
virtual mentorship the congressional app

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,230
challenge is a mobile development

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,030
competition at a district level and

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,520
winners from each district get the

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,250
opportunity to attend the reception in

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,470
Washington DC and display apps in the US

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,540
Capitol building it is for middle

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,700
schoolers and high schoolers and the

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,160
challenge launched in June and the

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,290
registration deadline is November 1st in

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,870
the Triangle District Congressman David

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,090
prices team hosts a kickoff event for

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,430
the app building support and so that

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,380
students have the needed support to

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,380
start getting their app developed

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,280
now I would like to talk about some more

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,210
organizations that girls can participate

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,000
in one of these organizations is chick

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,040
tech chick tech has many programs but

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,690
their high school program for girls is

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,240
one which I would like to highlight

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,070
teachers nominate 20 girls from their

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,380
school to participate in the program

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:08,410
which includes workshops and mentoring

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,850
girls in high school who have who are

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,550
new to technology and have never

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,699
experienced it are encouraged and are

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,190
the the students that are encouraged to

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,680
join the program nominations for girls

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,840
began in September and chick tech has a

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,270
kick off at Meredith College and monthly

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,460
workshops that take place all over the

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,740
Raleigh and Durham area girls who code

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,500
is another popular program that

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,630
encourages girls pursue coding careers

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,910
the program is for girls third through

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,070
twelfth grades girls who code coverage

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,740
school clubs to summer program summer

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,260
programs and courses starting a girls

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:52,360
who code club in school would be the

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,460
best way to participate here are some

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,039
more organizations that girls can

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:05,650
participate in and that encouraged girls

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:07,840
to pursue technology careers even though

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,300
there are several organizations to

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,729
encourage girls towards technology it is

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,639
not enough what is also needed to

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,349
inspire girls are women role models now

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,020
there are several women leading

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,720
technology companies in the u.s. yet

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:30,280
only 5% of women are in leadership

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:33,370
positions that might sound discouraging

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,669
but the real role models are parents and

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,580
teachers statistics show the 22 percent

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:41,979
of girls who have access to men Ament or

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,930
at home or school are more interested in

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:48,360
technology and have a high probability

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,360
to take up technology careers

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,460
I hope that by sharing my journey and

00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,800
eliminating some of the common

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,180
technology myths I have provided you

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,790
with the key to create the next

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,010
generation of female technologists and

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,490
as Melinda Gates said the next Bill

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,110
Gates

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,480
isn't going to look anything like the

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,850
last one are we going to recognize her

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,830
when we see her thank you and I would

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,440
love to hear from anyone here about how

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,600
I can continue my duties as a technology

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,490
ambassador and continue the

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,120
entrepreneurial journey with my app

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,440
Ripple's

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,780
thank you for your time

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:35,100
[Applause]

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:35,100
