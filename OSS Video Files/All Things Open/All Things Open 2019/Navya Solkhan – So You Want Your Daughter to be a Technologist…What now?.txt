Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Do you want to inspire your daughter, sister, niece or a girl to learn Technology? Are you wondering how to give them the early exposure and spark their interest and curiosity? With no prior STEM or coding experience, my friends and I built a mobile app as part of a global Technology challenge. This led to us winning the 2018 Congressional App Challenge for the Triangle area NC District 4. Come hear my journey on the mobile product development, the different opportunities for girls, and finding the right mentorship and role models. This session will also address the usual Technology myths that discourage some kids and how you can support and foster their interest in Technology.
