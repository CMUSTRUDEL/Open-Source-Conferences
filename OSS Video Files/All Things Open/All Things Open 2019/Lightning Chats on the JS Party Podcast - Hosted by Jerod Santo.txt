00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,969
okay well thanks so much welcome to a

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,240
live recording of Jay s party Jay's

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,789
party is a weekly celebration of

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,990
JavaScript and the web we are a podcast

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,000
that records live on Thursdays and we

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,550
are super excited I would say thrilled

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,779
but I saw Emma's talk this morning I'm

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,200
not sure if I can say it trilled or not

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,100
that's right I'm a thrilled American

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,399
excited to be here with you all

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,590
Jay s party is a show a queen called a

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,379
community celebration so we try to be as

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,170
community oriented and focused as

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,270
possible and there's three things that

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,300
we do towards that end the first one is

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,340
we do record live we have a free and

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,199
open slack chat where we encourage

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,360
everybody to come and hang out with us

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,770
while we record the show chat with us

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,660
interact with the people who are

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,780
recording that's on Thursdays 1:00 p.m.

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,570
us eastern and it's always way more fun

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,830
when there's life chatters there listen

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,590
you know another thing that we do to

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,070
stay community oriented is that we have

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,509
a request line so we take requests we

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,189
would love to hear from the audience we

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,680
love to talk about things and invite

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,900
guests who are already in Swan stew here

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,400
so we don't have to guess you all can

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,689
just tell us what you'd like to hear so

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
to do that you got to change all that

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,009
consul ash request hit Jay s party in

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,320
the drop down and let us know a show

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,310
that you'd like us to do and then the

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,780
third thing that we do is we come to

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,829
conferences and we hang out with people

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,189
and we shake hands

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,960
IRL we record chats we do talks such as

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,310
this one so that's what we're here to do

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,619
today and we're excited to do that so

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,180
here's how it's gonna work we're calling

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,040
this lightning chance I should say

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,649
another thing that we do is we

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,540
experiment quite a bit we're calling

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,850
this lightning chat it's a lot like

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,469
lightning talks where you have five

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,520
minutes to come up and talk about what

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,659
it is that you think is interesting and

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,100
we're gonna chat with you for five

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,140
minutes when the five minutes goes up

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,910
we're gonna kick you off the stage and

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,349
we're gonna have the next person come up

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,310
but it wouldn't be a JS party without

00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,150
some BMG beats

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,150
so please

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,000
model right y'all get down

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,980
we do this every week right we're just

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,330
sitting there unzoom and people are

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,330
watching and we're like yeah

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,829
okay well the sound of those beats means

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,930
it's time for Jays party

00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,999

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,959
Wedekind

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,409
we need to get Emma turned up is that

00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,709

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:06,999
talk louder be cool and we're ready to

00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:08,379
go so first up we did have a we primed

00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,549
the pump a little bit first of all I

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,370
should say this is for everybody to

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,930
participate in we were afraid or

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,239
concerned that perhaps nobody would come

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,620
up and we'd have not much of a show so

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,760
we did prime the pump and I do have a

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,040
short list of people that we've

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,199
contacted before that we would love to

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,669
chat with as we make it through the list

00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,650
so maybe some people don't show up maybe

00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,209
some people do we'd love to open it up

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,379
for everybody to come and talk and then

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,719
if we run out of time during this

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,510
session we are down on the third floor

00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,669
booth 72 with the mic all set up and

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,010
we'll continue the Lightning chats there

00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,319
if you don't get a turn here during this

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,120
session so the first person we like to

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,519
call up on the stage is Denise Cooper

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,379
Denise is happy to join us but has a

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,389
flight to catch so she's going first

00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:57,609
yeah and here comes a nice round of

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:59,709
applause for Denise hi thank you for

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:06,310
joining us please have a seat I'm

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:08,139
leaving my purse there okay so the other

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,400
thing I didn't say is maybe I did say it

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,199
but I'll say it again is that this is a

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,699
community thing so we want to talk about

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,280
anything that you want to talk about

00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,799
Denise we literally prepared nothing and

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:30,190
so please give us a topic and we're

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:33,039
happy to chat about with you because I

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,070
was really disturbed by the AWS talk I

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,139
was disturbed because there was an

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,580
implication that OSI approved licensing

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,280
ism

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,550
optional optional and that is not the

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,520
case so I called him out I called her

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,280
right now I don't you know I'm not

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,410
saying it's a bad guy but I think when

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,940
you let your customers decide how you're

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,070
going to engage with open source you run

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,040
the risk of listening to customers that

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,860
are maybe not so savvy and think that

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,510
you know changes may be in the air but

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,669
it's not clear to me that change needs

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,620
to happen to open source I think we got

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,610
this far because we made good choices

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,620
about how to make it last this long

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,330
and I think we should make changes to

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,130
the licensing schemes and to the

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,400
importance of licensing very very

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,520
carefully so that's what I would like to

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,110
talk about let's do that so one thing to

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,520
point out for those who weren't at the

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,160
keynote this morning listening to the

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,699
podcast is that there was a talk from

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,800
AWS as Arun Gupta in which he talked

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,889
about free credits for open source

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,930
projects man free credits for open

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,289
source projects with a set of criteria

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:48,130
and some of those criteria they put

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:50,020
preferably and in some cases I was like

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,400
that's overly restrictive and in other

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,070
cases like the licensing you brought up

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,310
I was wondering that seems a little it's

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,889
really dangerous so the point that you

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,460
like to highlight is free credits for

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,930
open source projects preferably OSI

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,729
approved projects is that that

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,669
preferable has to go away can you

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,470
explain OSI yeah sure this was I worked

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,470
on the US side for 10 years so I'm in a

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,729
good position to do anything I think I

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,669
might have served longer than anybody

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,060
almost anybody else but Michael Tiemann

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:25,990
local local god of open source was on

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,110
that board with me to the OSI decides

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,180
whether licenses are OSD compliant OSD

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,940
is the open source definition ten

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,919
clauses it's very straightforward it's

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,169
common right now for people to be

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,130
suggesting changes to open source that

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,979
would make it better

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:46,330
we actually got a license with submitted

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:49,060
this week called the the vaccine license

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,560
that it has a field of uses restriction

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,650
that only lets you use the software if

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,199
you vaccinated

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,270
children like people are suggesting

00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,620
really silly field abuse restrictions

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,500
but some of them are well-intentioned

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,570
like I wish that big corporations would

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,910
have to pay so I want to put a clause in

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,860
the license that says that that is a

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,720
field use restriction that automatically

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,479
disqualifies you from OSI approval

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,270
because that clause in the OSD says

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,650
things you cannot do field of use

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,229
restrictions and we talked about this a

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,600
lot twenty years ago most of us in those

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,490
days we're libertarians or at least

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,870
liberal-leaning and some of us didn't

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,960
want the software to be used for

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,570
instance for nuclear power or for

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,280
weaponry but we debated it out and

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,310
realized that we had to set that aside

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,440
in order to not create the slippery

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,400
slope of everybody needs a special carve

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,590
out and all through the history of OSI

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,270
licenses that aren't OSD compliant come

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,680
from companies that are trying to get a

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,090
carve out for their business model

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,010
because they don't have a good strong

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,750
understanding that open-source is not a

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,759
business model and they're gonna need to

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,720
change what they do they can't have

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,910
their cake and eat it too

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,580
either they get the halo effective open

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,470
source or they get to say how they want

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,699
to run their business in ways that

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,550
open-source people would not appreciate

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,830
but they can't do both and we've been

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,539
fighting that fight forever now it's

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,360
really disheartening to see a major

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,949
venue like AWS who's trying to convince

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,610
us that they're serious about open

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,250
source used the word preferable as

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,780
though there was any other option if

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,599
you're actually dealing with open source

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,610
now you'd be told that OSI doesn't own

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,500
the trademark to the term open source

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,000
nobody owns that trademark because the

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,209
trademark office decided that it wasn't

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,880
trademark COBOL okay but they do own OSI

00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:37,310
approved license which tells you that

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,740
that license fits within the OSD and

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,380
therefore it doesn't do anything to harm

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,570
the open source movement right so

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,120
examples of things recent things that

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,550
were problematic Facebook a few months

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,860
ago now a year ago now put a license

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,770
unreacted included an extra patent

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,360
clause and Apache said a lot of people

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,550
tried to talk them out of it they kept

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,040
they were sure they had to do it to fend

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,750
off piracy I said look you've got deep

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,580
pockets your job is to engage those PI

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,200
and take them to the mat look at what

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,030
Visio is doing that's what you should be

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,680
doing as a deep pocket not trying to

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,690
write your way around it but in the

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,610
meantime Apache is gonna say no to that

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,350
it's an additional obligation and as

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,300
soon as Apache started stripping out

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,150
react code they they shifted their

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,740
program right that is how we have been

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,300
enforcing for the last 20 years right

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:35,580
all right everybody round of applause

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:37,320
for the knees all right

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,240
we thought that buzzer would be fun

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,910
turns out it's kind of it's kind of rude

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,800
and so I apologize for that because like

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,060
I couldn't I could just hop into the

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,640
code and change it but let's not do that

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,150
if I go there okay next up if you're

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:58,770
here is Shawn Wang is Shawn here Shawn

00:09:51,150 --> 00:10:03,330
Swick's oh he's gonna miss it is Vanessa

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:07,530
Alvarez in the building oh my list is

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,500
running dry is mo Hampton here oh no

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:25,620
it's a round of applause um oh come on

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:27,000
down let's play this game if you had to

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:36,570
pick some interim music for yourself

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,310
what you would have you picked all right

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,089
mo well thanks for joining us the five

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:47,970
minutes on the clock

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:49,350
we'd love to chat with you and I've done

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:57,110
that transition about three years ago

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:57,110
and I love what I do right now defense

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,950
but the thing that I think about a lot

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,350
is those that have non-traditional CS

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,120
backgrounds and that come in I mean

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,440
there's some that come back from the

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,660
chemistry or

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,970
some people that have like a something

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,970
biology to come in or even people with

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,620
marketing the advertisement but I know

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,440
it's possible but I don't know how

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,410
others feel working with somebody who's

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,269
nonce yes on the team so I guess I can

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,970
open that up like how do you guys feel

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,970
when we come into that into space I

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:38,189
think we need to change the paradigm

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:42,259
what it means to become an developer

00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:44,699
mm-hmm because I have a CS degree and

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,170
that did put me in an advantage I'm not

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:49,019
gonna lie about that I do feel like that

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,600
was a privilege that being said in terms

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,120
of the things that I had to learn I had

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,800
to work hard to like learn those skills

00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,360
and to see people coming from

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,819
non-traditional backgrounds it's I love

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:08,129
working with them I feel like they bring

00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:11,009
a vantage point that I have not thought

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:14,029
about before I don't know how to like

00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,029
formulate my thoughts right now

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,720
traditionally through a certain pipeline

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,430
yeah I think it may be slightly harder

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,990
to break in yeah but honestly having a

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,399
more diverse background gives you an

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,790
advantage once you're in the game

00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,410
because I mean this may be Tooting my

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,480
own horn because I'm not a CS background

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,209
but I feel like you know if you go

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,860
through a CS program yes you understand

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,509
a little bit more of a lot of the

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,949
fundamental stuff but you actually don't

00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,139
have that much of a perspective of how

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,000
the rest of the world works right and if

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,100
you're coming from another background

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,990
especially if you're coming from you

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,600
another professional background that

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,639
synergy of skills of I understand how

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,740
this world works and now I understand

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,420
the code like that's an incredible

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,300
advantage because you can link between

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,980
those things one place where we as

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,350
coders often fall down is in

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,300
communication with people outside of the

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,680
software world but we're building tools

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,639
for humans we need to talk to those

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,400
people yeah I I feel like because I went

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,470
to CS ro I was very

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,050
tunnel vision and when I got to my first

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,000
job I didn't terribly like I thought I

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,430
was gonna quit or like get fired because

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,610
all I knew was how like that bubble sort

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,520
was worse runtime than no mergesort I

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,230
didn't understand the practicalities of

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,990
working in our environment and so people

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,000
who come from alternative backgrounds to

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,529
get into this role I think a they're

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,620
used to working harder than we are right

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,760
because you know unfortunately they feel

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,589
like they have to prove themselves more

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,290
and unfortunately that is the case I

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,730
would love to change that but they also

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,920
feel like if you come from a boot camp

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,870
you're better prepared practicality wise

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,020
to get into development than a CS

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,760
background at least in my experience

00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,900
it's good point to bring out and I was

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,339
just thinking about you saying people

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,500
that come from different backgrounds or

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,410
different unprofesional like for me I'm

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,510
a veteran so I will look at a problem

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,070
set differently and kind of charge for

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,870
it first I don't know there's a right

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,550
way to do things I'll go ahead first and

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:21,320
then figure out the you know the cloud

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:25,640
with damage later but but sometimes you

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,940
do feel as if you have to not equate so

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:32,930
like your intelligence I know

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,060
IBM I think just recently started doing

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,920
like apprenticeships not apprenticeships

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,750
bet like trials for our bootcamp

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,420
attendees where they would bring them in

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,490
and like hire them for a year and help

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,930
them grow so like even if you didn't

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,490
feel like you were prepared they would

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,110
try to coach you along and help you

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,640
because I think what's important is

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,680
potential and willingness to learn as

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,240
opposed to the piece of paper that you

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,459
would get if you graduated

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,679
and I think it's good also because we

00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,910
have like say for me I'm stronger

00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,959
probably in my soft skills and then

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,149
about how the skills are software

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,559
engineering but I do have the people

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,749
that have that background in education

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,879
they kind of bridge that gap yeah so

00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,189
it's very good as long as we know I've

00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,779
skillsets and we know the gaps that we

00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,029
come together I try to help each other

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,920
out so I'm glad you guys can talk to me

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,509
about that oh yeah and let's get rid of

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,990
the word soft skills they're human

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:20,509
skills

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,879
yeah this is how we interact with humans

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,050
and that is the end goal of what we're

00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,170
trying to do we're building things for

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,170
people

00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:46,790
Oh shout out to everybody at all things

00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:49,999
oh all right how about Maria Lamarr doe

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:55,459
she comes all right what's your intro

00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:57,350
music not singing

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:01,910
I'm not please don't give Gabe all

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,079
interviews well when you sit down you

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,670
can tell me if I pronounce your name

00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,389
correctly or you can chide me if I did

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:13,910
not please we'd love to call you by name

00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:15,259
Maria Maria Lamar doe very good I cannot

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,819
say it that well but I won't be my

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:18,529
master would you like to talk about

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:22,689
today I'm so I'm very passionate about

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,689
web accessibility and building community

00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:28,809
1 do both of those we got 5 minutes

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,459
sounds great ok very good

00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:36,019
what got you into it like what inspired

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:38,149
you yeah so I come from a non

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,579
conventional background so I'm actually

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,929
a behavior analyst and so I provided

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,339
behavioral therapy for people with

00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,230
developmental disabilities for eight

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,480
years before I switched into development

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,569
and while I was learning how to program

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,249
I was like so happy when I discovered

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:55,129
web accessibility and I was like oh yes

00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:58,460
this is for me so after that I just kind

00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:00,440
of went all in

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,020
civility I think what's interesting is

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,459
that we hear web accessibility and I my

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,650
first thought goes like screen reader

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,990
compliance and you know keyboard

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,459
navigation like all these things I also

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:15,080
feel like accessibility is broadened to

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,540
thinking about who's consuming your

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,110
applications and your and your website

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,089
so we are in a place of privilege where

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,680
we have high speed internet in this

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,089
country but if your app is being

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,890
consumed by people with lower speed

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,300
internet we need to be mindful of that

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,310
we shouldn't be shipping all of this

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,100
really heavy stuff so accessibility is

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,480
not just about you know what we

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,540
traditionally think of as accessibility

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,630
but also can people access your

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:46,400
application from like a hardware yeah

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,650
the network speed is a huge one I have

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,600
t-mobile which is great because they do

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,520
they give you internet access anywhere

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,290
you go pretty much like they had 200

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,940
countries or there ain't even that many

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,310
countries but essentially anywhere you

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,740
go you're gonna have internet access but

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,180
it's at two G speeds and if you ever try

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,190
to access the Internet

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,930
the websites you're used to accessing

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,730
from your desktop or your laptop even

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,890
over Wi-Fi or whatever at 2 G speeds on

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,470
a phone from somewhere halfway across

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:17,180
the world it is painful and many of us

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,400
Emma highlights the same practices that

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,950
are going to make your application

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,570
accessible to folks here who have

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,800
assistive software or things like that

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,110
are the same things that are gonna make

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,150
it accessible to folks who have really

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,430
poor internet connections yeah even

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,810
thinking about creating progressive web

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,520
apps where you could just launch right

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,340
off your home screen and it's just that

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,570
much easier like one step launch and

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,550
even if you don't have great

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:43,190
connectivity right so it's very

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,230
important and you know kind of playing

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,790
off of what Mo was saying coming from a

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,980
different background really gave me a

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,750
new perspective because I already had

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,600
the experience from all the users who

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,490
were struggling you know interacting

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,340
with this applications and I just didn't

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,740
know that the world existed for like

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,210
coding such things right so now coming

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,010
into it it's like well I know exactly

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,450
where all the pinpoints are now we can

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,070
what can we do to fix it

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,350
so I do think that it's super

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,170
advantageous to come in with fresh

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,640
perspective and never look like you're a

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,380
different background be like a negative

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,940
thing I think it's always a good thing

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,290
yes and I just talk a lot so you change

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,800
the subject so you cannot change it but

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,770
you go to your point about having seen

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,730
the users I wish every developer went

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,580
and looked at the users of their

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,810
application watch the music and users

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,410
narrow it up for their window or what do

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,910
you mean bring in folks who've never

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,260
used your application but are in your

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,730
target audience or who do use your

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,530
application every day and just watch

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,650
them use it yeah because your mind will

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:49,010
be blown yeah we have these models of

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,810
how our stuff works and other people

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,730
like normal people out in the world

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,110
don't have those models like every time

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,330
I've ever watched somebody use something

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,810
I build I'm flabbergasted like you do

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,180
what you do how yeah like it's humbling

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,220
because you realize how much your stuff

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,570
sucks yeah like I thought this was

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,220
really good then I watched you trying to

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,080
use it and it's not good it's not good

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,790
make assumptions that users use our

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,890
products that we the way we would yeah

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,960
well kind of seeing them every day yes

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,490
we built on them so like to us it's like

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,350
oh well we've definitely improved it and

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,050
now it's perfect and then you know

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,250
somebody's coming into it brand new

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:27,980
yeah is there any real low-hanging fruit

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,650
of accessibility or gripe like why does

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,560
everybody get this wrong um use buttons

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,340
for buttons links rulings don't take a

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,040
focus

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,860
yeah like outline please just don't do

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,680
it yes and if you are gonna create

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,270
custom elements like custom dropdowns in

00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,950
instances or you can't use like the

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,750
native semantic HTML elements you still

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,620
have to make concerns such that it

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,750
functions the same way in native input

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,240
would yes absolutely like I would always

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,650
say like whether you're considering

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,140
accessibility or not like just put your

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,080
mouse away try to navigate your entire

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,340
application with the keyboard only you

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,710
you're not turning on a screen we're

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,410
like just kind of go through that basic

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,760
navigation well with your keyboard and

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,860
you should be able to access everything

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,890
and if you can't then there's something

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:18,329
wrong I'm still try to figure that out

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,329
[Music]

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,820
did did Brian Douglas make it Brian here

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:40,900
here how about Eva howl or Ava she is

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:42,700
come on bro let's hear it for her as Ava

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,230
is walking up since so many people know

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,120
showed that is an opportunity for

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,740
everyone here who has a topic they want

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,450
to talk about so have that in your head

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,430
what would I talk about if I was on

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:56,200
stage so when Jared opens the door

00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:58,780
you're up you're ready is it Eva Eva Eva

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,490
very good Eva thanks so much for joining

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,360
us on stage here we're happy to hear

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,610
what you're up to you what you like to

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,800
talk about I work for a company called

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,660
this all apps and we have an apprentice

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,460
program where one of our big passion

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,410
projects is getting more women into tech

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,770
my founder is a woman we have a lot of

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:17,050
women on board and so what we do is we

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:20,140
take women who are coming out of boot

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,510
camp and we pair them with a mentor and

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,730
then were consultancy so we contract

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,160
them out together and with the idea

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,170
being that the woman gets mentorship

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,400
that she needs we've heard a lot of

00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,560
companies say they don't like tire

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,690
junior developers because they've got to

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,000
deal with the mentorship aspect right so

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,680
we provide that by pairing them up and

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,010
the company gets 40 hours of the junior

00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,960
and 20 hours of the senior and then the

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:48,760
end of the contract the company has the

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,710
ability to hire the woman very cool how

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,570
does it work in terms of if you're

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,160
interested in getting involved or you

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,470
can come by our booth we have one like

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,590
literally right outside this store or

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,210
you can email hi at the start Co how

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,120
does the mentorship aspect of that work

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,400
so it varies from woman to woman it kind

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,390
of depends on the contract too but the

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,180
idea is that the mentor is there to help

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,720
unblock the woman to check PR so that

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,809
she's not

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,659
mashing anything when she merges and

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:22,419
then also just to help navigate being on

00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,700
a technical team especially in a sense

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,429
where she may be the only woman on the

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,080
team and that gets a little bit more

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,090
tricky because a lot of times the senior

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,730
developer will be male and that's hard

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,889
to have that do but in that case we like

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,509
to try to plug her into her local

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:39,730
community where she can find more

00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:41,110
mentors that are female too even if

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:48,519
they're not working on that particular

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:51,580
project getting companies to put their

00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,809
money where their mouth is everybody is

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,899
out there talking about diversity

00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:57,580
inclusion I live in Silicon Valley

00:23:54,899 --> 00:24:00,039
everybody knows that there's 25 it's

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:04,029
like 25 percent of incoming software

00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:06,190
engineers are women we've done huge huge

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,870
pushes on this and I get calls and

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,490
people are super excited and this is a

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,940
wonderful program and we really want to

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:15,850
do this and I write back and I get radio

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,350
silence so I feel a little bit

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,600
frustrated in that aspect that people

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:25,690
are very willing to talk about it but

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,029
not willing to do anything so so when do

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,440
the women come to you first and then you

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:31,240
match them with a mentor and a company

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,669
or do they go to the companies they come

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,159
so we partner with boot camps all around

00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:37,779
the country and we get the women

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,309
applicants mainly through the boot camps

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,710
some some went through just Twitter

00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:45,070
outreach and our website and then the

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,740
idea is that we it's kind of a couple of

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,570
moving pieces obviously we want to pair

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,519
the woman up with the company and that

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,620
she has some basis and the technologies

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,029
that they're using and that there's a

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,679
good fit with the mentor

00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:00,100
obviously there's personalities there

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,840
too and then and then fit them with a

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,429
company and it kind of goes it goes back

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,450
and forth to make sure that everybody is

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:09,100
a good working fit I love this idea of

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,850
an apprenticeship I feel like this is

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,950
something that I mean it is definitely

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,830
important and helpful on the folks

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,870
coming in and I think from untraditional

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,980
backgrounds boot camps women who are at

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,929
a disadvantage other underrepresented

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,269
minorities who are do this added

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,690
disadvantage broadly we as an industry

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:29,119
stuck suck

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,369
at training people we are terrible I

00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,769
mean boot camps have solved the somewhat

00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:35,840
solved the getting in yep I get the

00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:37,190
first step and then what what do I do

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,419
every company I talk to is like do you

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,139
have seniors do you have seniors you

00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,659
have senior folks

00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:43,340
nobody's training senior folks right

00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:44,929
right everyone's trying to hire senior

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,639
folks but we don't have this pipeline

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,580
for how do I get from I just got into

00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:51,379
the industry to I'm able to lead a team

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,139
or be a senior or something like that so

00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,909
this props to you all for doing that

00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:57,859
that's that's great and I think you know

00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,299
the diversity aspect is is a key and

00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,519
important step but I'd love to see this

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,379
everywhere I completely agree because I

00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,940
think it's it's really hard for juniors

00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,859
to get that kind of on-the-job

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,809
mentorship that they need and so many

00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:10,849
companies for whatever reason just

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,529
aren't willing to take that on and hire

00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,389
juniors I know I think that a lot of

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,769
times either their senior engineers are

00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,210
not positioned to do it they don't want

00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:18,590
to take the extra financial burden of it

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,450
I mean there's all there's a lot of a

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,359
different a lot of different reasons for

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,240
it but in our cases is a way of us

00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,999
taking that out of the equation

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:33,169
[Music]

00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:34,580
yes we do do code exercises but it's not

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,049
a whiteboard interview we are actually a

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,519
fully remote company so it'd be a little

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:40,279
bit difficult to do a whiteboard

00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,769
interview and we we do other ways of

00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,229
measuring where she is and radiology

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:49,659
she's good at but no no whiteboard

00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:49,659
interviews I like that thank you

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,289
code schools only or can you be from an

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,940
on turn like a different background and

00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,580
still apply you can be from whatever

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,620
background you want to write we focused

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:05,299
mainly on boot camps just because

00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:07,850
[Music]

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,930
sorry about that no worries alright

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:16,120
let's hear for Eva whoo

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:21,920
[Applause]

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:25,820
Jigyasa Jigyasa Grover might be saying

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,910
that wrong I'll say if Shaun has showed

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,880
up and Brian and we also have we've got

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,550
talk to Maria and Moe we talked to

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,980
Vanessa is Vanessa here there's Vanessa

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:47,630
come on down

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:55,190
Vanessa Alvarez give her hi at the end

00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:59,059
of your list because it is yes talking

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,700
about changing careers like in the tech

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:03,110
industry prank the other person was

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,850
sucked on had a good idea about why

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:08,120
boring and I just want to hurt about

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,950
like what type of like interview process

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:16,130
you guys what you're currently companies

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:18,440
because I do I like white pudding

00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,960
interviews as a taker I hate it as a way

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,240
to find good people you like you would

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,429
prefer to whiteboard I didn't say I'd

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,590
prefer it's fun it's fun for me because

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:28,940
I love goofing off right so I'll get up

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,429
with folks and like whiteboard you get

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,020
to I don't I like whiteboards in general

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,550
that's how I brain your that's how I do

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,929
whatever the fan of whiteboards all

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,940
right and I have wise I've whiteboards

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,290
in my office it's a terrible way to

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,679
interview people yeah it's absolutely

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:45,290
terrible I think it's fun it's terrible

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,460
can you Amuro is terrible why it's

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,780
terrible it's because it's testing

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,120
completely different things than what

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,160
you care about for a candidate so

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,840
whiteboarding is testing how well do you

00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,090
improvised on the spot in front of

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,700
people that you don't know with a marker

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,020
in your hand and communicate and

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,590
communicate with people you don't know

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,910
which communication that part is

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,990
actually in my opinion kind of valid

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,670
because I think it's important that

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,670
engineers can communicate that's valid

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,559
on the spot under pressure in front of

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,120
people you don't know oftentimes with

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,179
folks who are not the kindest of

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,010
interviewers so yeah it's it's setting

00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:23,840
folks up for failure unless they're

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,059
skilled in things that are not actually

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,029
helpful for their job

00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:30,519
I had a it was it was a good experience

00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,139
but it really frustrated me because it

00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,139
was an interview for a UX engineering

00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:38,319
role building design systems with react

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:41,649
and the two out of the four interviews

00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,139
were about algorithms and so I had to

00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:46,359
code binary trees on a white board and

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:48,099
find the broken edge and I'm like how is

00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,889
this relevant to the job I'm gonna be

00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:52,449
doing it's not and now is so unfair to

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,969
so many candidates going back to the

00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:57,399
whole what if I'm not from a traditional

00:29:54,969 --> 00:30:00,099
CS background yeah how is that testing

00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,499
anyone's ability to like you know deduce

00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,539
information and like problem-solve to a

00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:07,089
certain extent it's not what if English

00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:09,579
isn't my first language I know well yeah

00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:10,149
so why would you suggest like the

00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,369
appropiate

00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:15,219
yeah what's better what will be better

00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:17,259
instead of I like to take home exam so I

00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:21,279
had a really great interview with Gatsby

00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:22,779
I it was they gave me a few they gave me

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,189
three questions and they said answer

00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,109
whichever one you feel comfortable

00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,699
answering to give options to your

00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:31,199
candidates is incredible that whole

00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:34,209
interview process was seamless they also

00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:35,679
liked the take home assessment first of

00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:37,449
all they were gonna pay you for it which

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,859
is amazing because often these companies

00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,719
put you through the wringer with the

00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:43,739
amount of interviews and it's unpaid

00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:47,109
right right the second piece of that is

00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:49,809
to do the tasks that you would be doing

00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:51,009
on the job a it's practical be you get

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,639
to see if you even want to do this job

00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:54,219
in the first place

00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:55,989
yeah so I think sticking to practical

00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,339
things that are also manageable because

00:30:55,989 --> 00:31:00,909
a lot of us have families and other

00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:02,709
obligations we can't give up time to go

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,689
on site and give up a full day of work

00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:08,589
and applying is like a almost a

00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:09,939
full-time job yeah so it's something

00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:12,549
interested that we've been doing in my

00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:15,069
company we stopped there whiteboarding

00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:17,459
and right now what we're doing is

00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:20,049
basically we have a bunch of like

00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:21,279
functions and then we tell the person

00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,379
like hey just pretend that you're

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,789
working we're working together

00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:27,309
collaborating just like a normal day and

00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:29,709
just tell us what is this function doing

00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:31,809
and then we started like talking and

00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:32,950
then if the person like we want that

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,289
engagement and we

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,019
like that conversation happening you

00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:39,820
were testing more of like not so much of

00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:42,760
like their technical skills yes in a

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,039
part but more about I crab collaboration

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,470
we want if this person will reach to us

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,990
if they have any questions yeah and it

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:53,080
has to work for that that's very less of

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:55,360
a test and more of collaborate right so

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,630
it's like do you read and understand

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,860
dysfunction yes okay awesome and if they

00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,929
get stuck what are you thinking about

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,309
tell us oh this is what I'm going

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:07,149
through my mind and that has worked

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:09,669
better and we have gotten them to be not

00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,590
so nervous and it has helped us a lot so

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,840
yeah I also think it takes a lot of

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,799
skill to be a good interviewer yeah

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,049
absolutely that's nor anything yeah yeah

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,460
sure I was just gonna say please don't

00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:25,269
try to trick your candidates and show

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,639
who you harder in the room the closer

00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,590
you can get to it being what it's like

00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,000
to actually work here the better your

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,010
patel you're gonna be able to get and

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,210
you do want to scope that within the

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,490
bounds of what's possible for that

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,049
person like my favorite both as an

00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,669
interviewer and an interviewee my

00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:44,919
favorite way to interview someone is to

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:46,840
do a scoped paid project now that is not

00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,490
always possible if you have a full-time

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,769
job and you have family obligations you

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,090
may not be able to take another paid and

00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,980
you know another project like that and

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,559
so you need to be accommodating but the

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,299
more you can get to this is exactly what

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,760
it's actually going to be like working

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:03,130
in this environment the better

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,279
you both have of being able to tell is

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,480
this gonna be a good fit yeah well

00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,049
that's our time Vanessa thanks so much

00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,300
the most fulfilling an awesome thing to

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,030
get to see new developers go from

00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,919
nothing to like fall awesome developers

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,260
yeah but yeah all the problems that

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,669
people are talking about with you not

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,110
hiring junior developers it's like I get

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,500
to see this up close and personal every

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,610
day and it's a you know it's it's that's

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
the most disheartening thing seeing

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:39,860
people say oh we only hire senior

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,050
developers because the people that I see

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,149
every day grow as developers are gonna

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,139
be the most amazing developers you've

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,350
ever met they're just not quite there

00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,780
yet

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,860
right there they're getting there but

00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,090
yeah it's such a cool thing I could

00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,770
answer any questions how do we bridge

00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,200
that gap I mean there's obviously a

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,680
problem but there's mean the obvious

00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,200
solutions to that problem so the easiest

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,200
way I've seen so far and this is just a

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,640
time is see that process like at this

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,740
point I've been teaching for about five

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,760
years and so I have people that I taught

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,590
who are now senior developers

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,030
organizations and they're hiring junior

00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,370
developers because they remember what it

00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,330
was like and they went through that same

00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:20,120
process but you know I think helping

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,920
companies learned that hiring junior

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,000
developers and training them is pretty

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,840
much the best invest

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,840
they can have you know our industry

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,030
people change the jobs so quickly right

00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,100
but you bring someone in early and you

00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,720
help train them and they become a really

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,090
loyal really amazing employee that knows

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,370
what's going on there you know as well

00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,530
as anyone but yeah I think it's it's

00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,540
educating the loyalty doesn't actually

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,800
stick because people do move around so

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,210
much that if I'm going to invest three

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,090
years in a person and they're gonna go

00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:50,600
upgrade to a different job that's to

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,340
meet at the law yeah well I think to

00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,380
both of your points you have to think

00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,660
about it as an investment investments

00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,030
have risks there are things but if we're

00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,280
willing to put in you know thousands of

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,350
dollars to recruiting we should be

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,850
willing to put in half of that amount to

00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,950
training the people we already have

00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,660
absolutely I mean frankly I'd say twice

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,490
that amount right if it if it costs you

00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,050
ten thousand dollars to recruit a new

00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,570
senior developer and you have someone

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,310
who is already contributing but you can

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,530
spend ten thousand dollars to upgrade

00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,870
them to a senior developer like it's a

00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,070
no-brainer right there's an old saying

00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,920
that I'll butcher but it goes something

00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:27,800
like what if talking about investing

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,120
training in their engineers what if we

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,350
train we spend all this money training

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,820
them and then they leave and then the

00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,070
response is what if we don't spend it

00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,470
and then they stay like they're gonna

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,820
stop forever no nothing wrong look at

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,280
those look get better but you can see

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,830
that and the other thing pest loyalty is

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,570
I think there's no better way for your

00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,700
senior developers to get better at being

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,810
senior developers than to train to your

00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,600
developers like what are you seeing

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,890
you're in if you have no wonder teaching

00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,000
people ask me all the time like oh do

00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,860
you get bored teaching the same thing

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,630
over and over like you have no idea I

00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,430
learned something every single day

00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,420
teaching new developers they ask

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,370
questions that I would have never

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,750
thought of there's new technologies they

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,840
have to learn like I've grown as a

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:08,390
developer more teaching than I ever did

00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,940
previously and and I think that's that's

00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,560
gonna be true in any company if you have

00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,940
your senior developers actively working

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,980
to mentor people we do JavaScript and

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,710
Python so it's a full-stack curriculum I

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,600
just switched thing i i tinker all the

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,950
time with it but so we do JavaScript for

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,420
the first half of the course and Python

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,200
and Django for the further second half

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,420
of the course it's 12 weeks long

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,400
yeah full immersion or part time it's

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,140
full immersion so it's all day long you

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,839
know 9:00 to 5:00 like four hours of

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:40,299
lecture and you know who knows how many

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,829
hours of projects every day I kind of

00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,630
burn him out a little bit we try that

00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:45,250
but to 60 hours a week the folks back

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,730
there know how many hours yeah and

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,990
they're going oh yeah this so they're

00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,099
getting a break right now because we get

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,359
to come out here to see this but I

00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:59,140
thought it's so cool to have them

00:37:52,359 --> 00:38:01,569
immersed in industry because like I

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,430
didn't get to go to conferences until I

00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:08,470
was like well into my first jobs yeah so

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,940
do you feel pressured to constantly be

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,069
updating that curriculum especially with

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,290
how fast the industry moves yeah I mean

00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:15,940
for multiple reasons right I always want

00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,490
them to have the very best of content

00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,290
and also for me and other instructors it

00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,670
is I mean it sharpens our skills to

00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,020
constantly be revisiting what we're

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,910
doing making sure we're doing it right

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,559
but you know every class there's stuff

00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,760
that people get stuck on that I go oh I

00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,700
know a better way to teach that or a

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,380
better way to learn that yeah so there's

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,930
some pressure but I mean it's it's fun

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,309
to do I think you know teaching is hard

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,859
but if you have the bug like you never

00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:43,180
want to stop doing it how can people

00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:44,799
apply how well they can go to momentum

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,630
learn comm if they're interested but um

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:49,930
you or you can just find me or anyone

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:56,809
else around here very good

00:38:49,930 --> 00:39:01,500
[Applause]

00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:02,880
come on down to Chinatown well I was

00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,140
singing the theme earlier but no one

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,609
seemed to understand that's what we're

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,839
gonna do we're gonna get the for our

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:09,510
next lighting chat session we're gonna

00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:12,960
get the theme song to play as you come

00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:19,829
down hi what your name good afternoon my

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:25,200
name is avi Henry in French yeah merci

00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:31,020

mother tongue I know she can handle JB

00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,890
that tone - I said I'm Canadian I live

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,460
in Toronto okay this is a translation

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,460
podcast

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:57,540
Paquito okay all right let's go

00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,980
I mean we just flipped the podcast okay

00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:06,809
so it's not oh man we just started

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:09,059
okay so I tend to hang out in the whip

00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:10,500
foreman space so I was like oh man I

00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:12,270
think people are gonna be bored but I'm

00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,829
here to talk about something that's

00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:18,150
being worked on right now which which is

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:20,160
the JPEG XL so kind of a new format so

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,260
any you know for all the web developers

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,960
out there images are a huge problem on

00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,640
the web in fact actually for the person

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,619
who talked about accessibility the

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,710
number to actually issue in

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:34,500
accessibility is through images which is

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,530
alt text so images are a problem like

00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,180
through and through so with the JPEG

00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,280
Excel basically what's gonna happen is

00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,579
well essentially what happened let me

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:50,490
backtrack a couple years ago this is my

00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:52,740
time up it's okay a couple years ago to

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:55,290
celebrate sort of the 25th anniversary

00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:00,329
of the JPEG the joint photographic

00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:02,160
experts group Prada CFP and because the

00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:05,460
JPEG is a format that's kind of like

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,700
always being worked on and so they

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,240
receive

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:13,060
seven submissions and two or pick so

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,550
basically they're trying to see like how

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,920
we can go about and improve the the JPEG

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,099
as a format and essentially what

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,640
happened to were selected one so the gun

00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:26,589
takes or the best of both so one is the

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:33,190
I'm gonna pronounce it improperly but

00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:35,290
we've which is the free universal image

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,050
format which was being developed by

00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:40,599
cloud nari and the second was Pik Pik

00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,089
which was another format that was sort

00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,730
of being experimented with by the people

00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:48,070
at Google so the two sort of like the

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:50,530
best of both are gonna be used as they

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,119
sort of make their way to this new

00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:58,780
format which is going to be called the

00:41:52,119 --> 00:42:01,150
JPEG Excel so essentially with with any

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:05,890
sort of like reset format you're gonna

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:09,579
get some improved encoding for sure but

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:13,180
things like responsive web design has

00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:14,950
been a huge burden on the web simply

00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,839
because a lot of people just do not get

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:20,020
it right so you end up having a lot of

00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,150
data waste being sent down the pipe to

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,589
users and actually by corporations as

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,880
well because you get that wrong those

00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,310
are your service that you have to sort

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,460
of you know pump that that the the

00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,410
resource is down so that you know

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,839
obviously you're gonna have animation

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,670
which is also a bit of an issue on the

00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:41,230
web because a lot of people do fall back

00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:48,760
to the grossly oversized jiff

00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:50,380
yes I said Jeff and so that encoding is

00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,790
going to be improved obviously we're

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,430
gonna have alpha channels they're gonna

00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,109
have adaptive compression so essentially

00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,460
parts of the images are going to be

00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:00,099
compressed a little better than the

00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,410
others the ones that need it anyhow

00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:06,369
and obviously it's most likely going to

00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:09,280
be mostly lossy but with the best

00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:11,470
encoding past but at times so you have

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,859
this sort of like CAHSEE lossless thing

00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,859
going on

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,039
[Music]

00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:22,980
okay well I mean this information online

00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:25,700
for sure if you go to I believe JPEG dot

00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,160
org but at the end of the day I think

00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:31,200
most people know images and most web

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,069
developers certainly need to work with

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:39,049
images and it's just something that bi

00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:42,930
you talked about sort of be having

00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:45,630
constricted data or networks I would not

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,519
know exactly you don't handle images

00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,910
properly this is where you're gonna feel

00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:49,910
it the most

00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:58,619
you're wasting this time actually you

00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,049
brought up accessibility yes yeah and

00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,990
one of the things that I have seen

00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:06,029
bandied around is embedding some of that

00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:07,950
alternate text in images so that it's

00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:09,089
not dependent on the web developer it

00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,039
can actually be encoded is that

00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:12,359
something that's included so it that's

00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,710
actually separate it's funny you say

00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,930
that because I'm preparing some

00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,710
approacheth gonna talk on that there is

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:23,250
a a push towards automation of alt text

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,049
so this is completely separate but IG

00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,220
well Instagram Facebook has been doing

00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:28,829
it for a while

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,869
chrome in Canary as an experiment you

00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:33,089
could actually get that done right now

00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:35,130
as we speak but it's behind a flag but

00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:36,779
again that has less to do with

00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,980
performance unfortunately yeah that

00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:39,269
feels like something where machine

00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,640
learning image directly oh it's

00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:43,849
happening super what's happening as we

00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,849
speak

00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:53,230
[Music]

00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:56,309
[Applause]

00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,309
[Music]

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,350
price is right we need an extra mind

00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,300
cover here we have a few more slots

00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,880
after this one if you'd like if you're

00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,340
interested come close so we have less

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:18,970
awkward stalling hello oh hi what's your

00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:38,270
name we would talk about well thank you

00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:49,190
we appreciate that Wow took ten years

00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:54,170
off and then came back in software

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:56,840
developer again so the senior we had an

00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:01,250
apprenticeship I had a mentor which was

00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:04,130
crucial to the program but I think it's

00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:06,260
another way to bring women in that have

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,810
had experience and you know that you

00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:12,410
know we've done our learning at one

00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:14,450
point right and then just have the

00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,830
opportunity I'm so excited to be back in

00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,750
the field that's beautiful

00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:25,040
what's change the most from your first

00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:27,830
time near to know I think that the

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,560
database work for me

00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:33,650
wait easier not way harder way different

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,230
me Annette I a relational databases into

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:39,590
the no sequel was

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,960
I would say my biggest leap okay

00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:46,160
when I left I was doing Java and web

00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:49,790
services and now it's no js' cloud and

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:54,500
no sequel so a couple of different jumps

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:58,690
but I started in the mainframe so Oh

00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,690
going from Fortran in high school

00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,400
history I was in scientific computing

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,260
back in the day yeah what hasn't changed

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,250
then you come back here like what what

00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,670
hasn't changed

00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:16,820
oh you're saying everything has changed

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,080
I get it what hasn't changed surely

00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:24,380
there's some constants change is the

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:26,150
only constant thing I would say gives me

00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,530
this look like you're gonna back me up

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,530
here right I just blew my mind

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,720
then historically

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:49,089
um I draw on a lot of my knowledge from

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,859
other programming languages and database

00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:53,589
how did you get up to speed when you

00:47:50,859 --> 00:48:01,170
came back in I started well you know

00:47:53,589 --> 00:48:05,170
what I listen to podcasts and I did

00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,910
online training when I could because it

00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:11,200
was still a full-time job raising kids

00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,180
yeah so yeah that was that was it and

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,559
then when I started it was a 12-week

00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:21,460
apprenticeship with the option of on

00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:25,150
both sides being hired or not at the end

00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:27,849
so that was my 12-week of okay here's

00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,880
your project yeah that you've got the

00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:32,559
best-trained if you can make that happen

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,700
I mean that if I'm looking for a job

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,309
that's my favorite way to interview

00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,510
because it's how you learn what this

00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:38,950
place is gonna be like to work with

00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,480
because folks will put on their happy

00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,650
face when they're interviewing you and

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,349
you work with them for a while and you

00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,270
discover it is a cesspit or other folks

00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:48,220
who are like not super jazzed at

00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,480
interviews and don't do it very well but

00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,319
then you work there and it's like the

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,859
best place ever so yeah that is so when

00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:58,200
I really oh you're on probation for six

00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:00,460
months and I was like what do you mean

00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,440
and they're like no it's a standard so

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,510
you're on everyone generally joins

00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,790
probation for six months at the end

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,500
either party can walk away that's a good

00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,940
amount of time to like get your to know

00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,400
yeah yeah but that's

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,210
we should standardize that a cool idea

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,210
yeah absolutely

00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:27,130
I think that both sides is key to write

00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:29,079
like this is this if it's instituted as

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,240
a company power-play it's terrible right

00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,640
like oh we're gonna be watching you for

00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,680
this first 300 six months and you know

00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,470
then we decide this is a weird word but

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,240
if you come in with it saying like this

00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,670
is a period I do it as a consultant I do

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,369
it if I'm looking for a job like I want

00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,109
to do a test run and I want to figure

00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:49,480
out by working with you is this a good

00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:51,250
place or not and it's my decision to

00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,869
walk away and yeah you can decide if you

00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,490
want me to go to but you won't

00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:56,490
it's my people

00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:05,640
awesome jail thank so much for joining

00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:10,980
us thanks for looking on the show and

00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:12,750
welcome back to the community yeah okay

00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,310
I did see another hand poked up and then

00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,110
it dropped immediately I'm hoping that

00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,530
hand will go back up again oh here it is

00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,930
right here

00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:23,330
oh yes pointing fingers no I'm not sing

00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:26,770
all right here she comes

00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,770
[Applause]

00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,130
voluntold

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:36,180
I like that hello what's your name

00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,860
Janissa today nice and meet you Jenny

00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,930
thanks for coming up on stage with us

00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,470
would you like to talk about um I wanted

00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,160
to answer Vanessa's question about

00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,590
whiteboarding alternative stuff

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,980
whiteboarding okay what other companies

00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:51,810
are doing yeah so um I guess briefly my

00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,240
background is graphic design and I would

00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,130
just go for design so there are a lot of

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,900
people I know who are making that jump

00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,490
from design into development it's kind

00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,010
of a natural right you're like already

00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:03,570
on the computer exactly people are gonna

00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,410
ask you to do little HTML here and there

00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:09,930
and the next thing you know you're like

00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:12,600
full-on so I actually I took a career

00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,280
break and I came back and I found out

00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,880
like everything changed and how do I

00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:22,080
quickly get up to speed on how to code

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:25,770
and I end up doing a lot of job hunting

00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,230
and one of the places that I interviewed

00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:31,470
at was read ventures and they had a

00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:33,630
booth here at ATO last year and I met a

00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,300
guy who was like who remembered my name

00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:39,210
and when they came up for looking for

00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:42,030
someone to hire they reached out to me

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:44,040
and said you know we really liked you we

00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:47,430
don't really have a role in particular

00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:50,520
but we'd like to talk with you so they

00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:53,850
brought me in to do like a one of those

00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,770
like meet 10 people for six hours like

00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:57,960
it was one of those big interviews but I

00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:01,730
didn't I did have to do whiteboarding

00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,650
but I sat on a panel for

00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,780
a couple hours if he just asked like

00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,640
explain what are you good at and like

00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,930
why are you here and like you know and

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,580
just really under try to get an

00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:13,430
understanding of where my strengths are

00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:16,310
and my interests and then they were able

00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,859
to kind of like manipulate the the

00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,890
interview to see exactly how I would fit

00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:23,599
in so I did do a white board I really

00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:25,849
slept at it but they were like we were

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,740
we do like we don't expect you to be

00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:29,150
good like me we know you're gonna be

00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,220
sweat and we just want to like hear how

00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:34,070
you think and you did well even though

00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:37,190
you feel like you did poorly yeah

00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,470
so they were very interested and I did

00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:42,619
end up passing on that opportunity and

00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:44,450
recently I got employed on another

00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,119
company called Metheny and then I did

00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:54,770
another career job so I'll be starting

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:57,710
at IBM under the cognitive applications

00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:59,810
is the larger department and then I'll

00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:04,430
be doing front-end development for them

00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:06,440
so they had it was so cool it was very

00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,089
cool and it was some at first I thought

00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,650
I don't play a couple of times before

00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:11,570
and failed and I was like I'm not gonna

00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,380
do this again I'm just so tired you know

00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:18,440
but a recruiter found me on LinkedIn and

00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:20,660
it was a take home application so what

00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,109
was cool is that they didn't have a

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:27,140
particular goal they basically gave you

00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:28,550
a very open-ended app task and they

00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,339
wanted to see how you thought all the

00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:34,670
way from the wireframe UX UI strategy

00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:36,290
into development so I ended up like to

00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,089
me it felt like a fun personal pet

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:42,170
project so I already went in and not

00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:44,480
having that pressure and um I just went

00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,760
to town on it like I went on my XD

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,560
skills and my wireframing and UX and

00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,570
then into my front and development and

00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,160
then even try to do a little back in

00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,410
with some Express

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,920
you know it was kind of I was afraid I

00:53:54,410 --> 00:54:02,270
wasn't going to get it but um when I had

00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,560
the chance to come in and just tell the

00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,720
team because you have to sit with two or

00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,820
three developers I got to explain like

00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,400
my whole process and what I was thinking

00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,810
and why I did it and just go through all

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,700
the things that I was really strong

00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,480
about like all the things I was pretty

00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,160
good in and then I think they also kind

00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,870
of stepped back and thought okay you

00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,400
know like she's pretty good with this

00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:25,340
probably not as strong as here but I

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,570
didn't feel that pressure no binary tree

00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,170
searches because I have gone through

00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:32,510
that that was ridiculous I'm a designer

00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:38,780
first right and then developer so I can

00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:40,730
draw your tree this is this should not

00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,100
be like if you're looking at your hiring

00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,290
process as an employer like this should

00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,000
not be a judging process this is dating

00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:49,250
right I don't go on a date I mean I

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,930
haven't been on a date in 20 years but I

00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,750
don't go on a date and be like all right

00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,430
you're seven out of ten on this and a

00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,350
nine out of ten on that right like it's

00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,030
looking for compatibility it's looking

00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:01,580
for like are you the type of person that

00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:03,560
I want to work with and then as this are

00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,180
you gonna fit well in our team and I

00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,460
think that's the that's probably how you

00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,890
can retain talent because if I'm coming

00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,440
in knowing like I'm going to be looked

00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:15,320
on like they're expecting me to do well

00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,630
at what I'm doing well already then you

00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,160
