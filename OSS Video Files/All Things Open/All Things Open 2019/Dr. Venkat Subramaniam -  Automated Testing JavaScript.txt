Description: 
	JavaScript is one of the most powerful and yet perilous languages. It is arguably the most ubiquitous language, the king of the client side programming the web. The dynamic nature of the language offers many benefits, but the weak typing and lack of tooling can make changes unpredictable, that is, if weâ€™re not careful. Automated testing can greatly alleviate the pains and lead to more fruitful development. In this presentation we will take look at the tools, but also the approach to automate the tests for JavaScript code. We will start with simple cases at first, but quickly dive into dealing with dependencies, and measuring code coverage.
