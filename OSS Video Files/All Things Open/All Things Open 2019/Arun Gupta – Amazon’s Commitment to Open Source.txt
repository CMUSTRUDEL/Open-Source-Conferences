Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Amazon is a customer-obsessed company: we write software to meet customer needs. Roughly 90-95% of our roadmap is driven by customer needs, and the rest is what we think the customer wants. This holds true in open source as well. This talk will explain Amazon’s motivation to open source and how we continue to invest to make open source more accessible for everybody.
