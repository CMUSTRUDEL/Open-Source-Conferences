Title: Arun Gupta – Amazon’s Commitment to Open Source
Publication date: 2019-11-05
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Amazon is a customer-obsessed company: we write software to meet customer needs. Roughly 90-95% of our roadmap is driven by customer needs, and the rest is what we think the customer wants. This holds true in open source as well. This talk will explain Amazon’s motivation to open source and how we continue to invest to make open source more accessible for everybody.

00:00:08,290 --> 00:01:25,210
is it so

00:01:59,240 --> 00:03:02,850
so often times we will deliver off-grid

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,880
passes because we don't want a name

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,120
technically we're already so there is no

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,239
variation no divergence between the

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,610
offering and the project that we are on

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,130
the service party and last but not the

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,320
least political benefits when it gives

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,630
you the ability for more ions

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,630
absolutely least part it's like sqn

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,390
now-now-now

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:10,360
was different now

00:05:23,490 --> 00:06:18,099
exactly the project certificate of the

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,699
rituals

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:24,430
it consists of four key components as we

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,560
say there is outstanding website if the

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,320
back in module there is a offs and there

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,250
is nowadays and these all interact with

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,389
each other

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:40,090
now the detail of each module will tell

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:45,400
you exactly how the ideas will be by

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,860
using fire and the backing vocals how

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,190
people who will use for testing and the

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,860
backing and how do you see what are the

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,139
best practices and again as I said these

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,740
were truly inspired by service to

00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,740
repository

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,959
[Music]

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,040
[Music]

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,350
[Music]

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:44,270
so we make ourselves more available in

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,270
all these foundations so that we can

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:51,830
test one and of course Caleb's offering

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,830
all of the resource events

00:09:28,520 --> 00:10:40,020
so we are testing divided or it'll must

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:48,090
oftentimes they reach out to us he was

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:50,220
fellas can he give us we need parents to

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,510
make sure that this project is

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,870
sustainable for us so the way I am very

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,140
excited this program this program would

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,140
have

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,990
[Music]

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:44,420
this is both in Reverse and now the rush

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,020
is the most loved enactment for the

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,020
latest Apple

00:13:01,590 --> 00:14:02,320
they give you all the details we will

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:06,640
most likely improve and a calculator to

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:15,160
our deserts then you've come to

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:19,690
diligence in terms of friends so we

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,690
always pocket makes for their sake

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,550
they usually have money wisely so once

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:34,650
again I would request to spread this

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:34,650
word on how we so really surprised

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,560
we also look at multiple ways of

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,840
supporting open source communities one

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,370
of the ways that this client was

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,260
probably the best friends we also do to

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,560
open source projects to reduce our

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,530
technical debt and Jennifer everybody

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:07,690
helps us increase quality and security

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:10,090
of the projects you are not more about

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,530
what we're doing around whistles take a

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:17,110
look at this we also have a block that I

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,050
talked about this is those very first

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:26,440
rocks of this over there and letting us

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:29,100
know post about this way and last but

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,100
not least we have

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,130
[Applause]

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,130
