Title: James Schweitzer - The Value Of Old People In Technology
Publication date: 2019-11-02
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Nearly 56% of workers in IT will be involuntarily forced to change jobs after the age of 50. Many will get new positions at 50% of previous pay. 37% of workers will be forced into retirement before they are ready, straining budgets and making retirement less secure.

The key take away is there is a bias against older workers in tech. They are more expensive, but in general are worth the extra cost. Workers over 50 take fewer sick days than 18-30 year olds. Workers over 50 in technology have changed focus every three to five years. They have proven ability to take on new technology and integrate it into their skill set.

While there is clear evidence that older workers face bias in the workplace, based on assumptions that they are inflexible, expensive and behind the times. Statistics actually show extensive and proven flexibility, cost for performance ratios that are favorable, and proven ability to stay up to date with new skill sets.

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,490
you

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,510
I like to thank Todd on this one before

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,520
I go too far for putting me last after

00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,380
all the really good speakers so I'm

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,220
gonna let y'all down a little bit maybe

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,300
I don't know

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,730
we'll go on this one um I get nervous

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,579
too when I speak even though I've been

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,320
extremely lucky in my life and been able

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,510
to do a technology career from a very

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,540
young age without any of the obstacles

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:43,780
most other people had to go across so it

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,610
starts off with there's a lot of myths

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,890
out there what happens to older workers

00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,410
and that's what I'm going to start with

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:54,450
I think everybody knows a8 bias out is

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,920
out there once you get to a certain age

00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,620
technology careers are almost you almost

00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,210
disappear and it's a shocking change for

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,809
people because you've been successful

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,420
for 30 40 years in your career and all

00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,590
of a sudden BAM they don't want you

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:15,490
anymore and that's not necessarily for

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,290
everybody half the people that hit 50

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,770
are going to be involuntarily separated

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,270
from their job and when they go out and

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,780
find another one when they still got 15

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,800
20 years worth of work left in them when

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,600
they go back and find another one

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:34,300
they're gonna find one that's pays less

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,970
probably have probably as less prestige

00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,770
everything else and that's where you

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,549
start coming into some interesting

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,640
concepts there's a lot of things they

00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:48,070
say why does that happen they think

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,060
wanted a mr. pop up there is older

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,830
workers inflexible out of touch they're

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,530
all used to seeing Bill Gates as a

00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,619
teenager as we've had him brought up or

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,210
Zuckerberg or two guys who started

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,420
googled I forgot their name of already

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,900
but I think one Sergey that you know it

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,099
comes on that one right and they have

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,099
all these people you think there's these

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:15,280
young dynamic groups that pop up then

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,830
the truth is that the vast majority of

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,830
startups are started up by people in

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,980
their 40s and higher the successful ones

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,180
the ones that um that the ones that make

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,790
money

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,469
or the ones that stay in business for

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,890
more in five years or actually started

00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,180
by people in their middle age and maybe

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,980
that's a slight difference you don't get

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,530
the mythology these huge companies that

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,939
we see out there now occasionally but

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,849
most of the ones that create our jobs

00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:45,790
are started by that one so this really

00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,889
is a myth and flexibility is one of

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,280
those things I don't know about you guys

00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:54,069
but when I started 30 some odd years ago

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,109
in technology my first computer was an

00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:01,900
Atari 800 with 48 kilobytes of memory

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,370
right and hand a floppy disk using a

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,340
hole punch so you can flip it over and

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,200
use the other side stuff like that my

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,739
first paying job I think I was using

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,049
Novell networking devices I forgot what

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,109
it is that where something like that try

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,510
it in and B and T connectors so you

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:23,079
start going back and thinking I have

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,519
changed technology and now and I have

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,780
some of my co-workers or in the audience

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,449
to kubernetes and agile workspaces and

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,799
ansible and all those other types of

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:39,010
things I've changed technologies dozens

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,299
of times in a 30 year career so you've

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,400
already proven that when you hire

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,500
somebody straight out of college they

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
haven't made that switch shot and you

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,169
actually lose a lot of people when they

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,209
you have to when all of a sudden the

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:53,139
technology changes it is something that

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,639
changes the world for people and I've

00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,590
actually seen this this I put in that

00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,500
second one up there experienced workers

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,540
will be bored with their new position

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,560
right because this job I actually seen a

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,150
recruiter on LinkedIn say that say we

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,120
don't want people who've been working a

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,430
long time because they'll be bored

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,650
obviously there's a lot of reasons why

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,220
somebody might take or apply for a job

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,659
that's not technical or it isn't to the

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,419
level of technology you've had before

00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:26,050
you might want to do something again

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:28,750
because I love working in the cloud now

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,690
but you know I used to love picking up a

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,380
server and shove it in the rack to sew

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,150
or running cables sometimes it's just it

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,770
might not be as technical position but

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,830
it's something a little bit different

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,300
and you might just want to slow down you

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,819
might want to stay technical you might

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,289
not want to go to management which a lot

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:51,819
of things get pushed on that one

00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:54,849
there's a lot of reasons for that let's

00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,259
see what else got nothing next yeah it's

00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,870
hard to read these signs on that one

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,759
yeah I should have used a bigger font

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,220
that's a Sark so sorry on that one I'm

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:07,720
not following my own thing on this one

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:11,169
um younger management my boss now is

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,759
younger than I am that's not terribly

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,340
unusual because there's people who like

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,139
to work for I mean there's people who

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,419
want to go into management I prefer to

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,250
stay in front of a computer because I

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,860
don't really like people let's just see

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,090
it's just weird overtime on that one the

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,620
more you talk to them the more crazy

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,009
stuff happens it comes out of their

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,490
mouths

00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,659
now I'm mainly mainly my mouth most the

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,569
time at work but that's a different

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:38,139
story too but that's really a management

00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:42,550
problem right it's not my fault that

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:44,889
you're young and you're in charge of me

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,080
and when you start getting to do you get

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,150
these weird balances and dynamics they

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,389
think well I'm older I know more than

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,280
you do but it actually is one of those

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,380
interesting things when like a start-up

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,750
or a small company and you bring

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,669
somebody older in they see problems

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,479
earlier because they've seen similar

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:06,849
things before yeah I met I don't really

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,590
use my Atari basic as much as I did when

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:14,620
I was 17 but I know not to put a go-to

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,780
statement into a Python program so you

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,789
know you goes back to the old days right

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,280
we don't have to number our lines either

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,409
anybody ever use COBOL out there yeah

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,060
there's some people on that one still

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:26,229
can't get the spacing right yeah they

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,039
have that all the letters at the right

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:33,159
place it's um it's scary one I actively

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,139
try to like take important part out of

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,389
any COBOL machine I have so we have to

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,069
rewrite the other application because

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,750
eventually it's like you don't want to

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,130
deal with that all right what's number

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,300
four guys seed anymore there we go

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,860
now this is an interesting one that

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,199
really shocked me when I looked at this

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,070
technology when I looked at this you

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,800
would think as you get older you

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,920
dr. more you have more responsibilities

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,750
at home you have to take your children

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,680
places because they haven't learned how

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,810
to drive yet

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,250
generation Z doesn't get driver's

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,820
licenses right that's what they're

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,650
saying when they were supposed to but

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,410
that's another myth - I'm making fun of

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,000
them but I do I say that the oldest

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,980
generational stuff that people come up

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,980
like Z and millennial I'm actually in

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,180
tax somewhere in there so the Lost

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,400
Generation they called us the me

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,960
generation at that time if that sounds

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,040
familiar to anybody who's really young

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,490
now and they tell you you're

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,590
self-centered and selfish and and only

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,380
think about yourself they say about

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,380
every generation pretty young people yes

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,330
a it's just a matter of it's lazy

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,610
writing I think they use the same

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,830
stories over and over again just change

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,160
the technology but I went off topic

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,870
again because I love going on tangents

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,280
and that's a mathematical thing I'm

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,790
going to ask you about after this is

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,800
over

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:56,900
hey yeah I dare here she is okay okay

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,320
well but what I was saying on that one

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:04,330
is older workers actually take fewer

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:08,300
sick days then younger workers do and

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,880
which is remarkably shocking on that one

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,040
do I know when I play sports I feel it

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,540
now it's like oh I don't have to

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,470
practice anymore because I'm not going

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,410
to get any better

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,830
I learned that oh I learned that for a

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,480
while there it's like I am maxed out on

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,100
whatever sport I am playing at this

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:30,710
plane but as you see they don't really

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,110
need to take more time and when you look

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:37,460
at the numbers it's just a myth it isn't

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:40,370
true and this is one that's always out

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,229
there to myth a digitally native people

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,840
who've grown up with computers and

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:51,200
devices and phones and their hands their

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:52,450
entire lives it's it's actually it

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,710
doesn't mean you're technically savvy

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:59,060
just means you have a phone right it's a

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,000
different thing it's a it's what you

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,980
have to do it's um as you grow into this

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,690
philosophy moving this mic too much can

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,930
I say another one of those things you

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,930
get a

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,910
learn uh I'm used to just yelling at

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,130
work we have an open workspace now I

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:18,130
just start talking and everybody listens

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,779
it's great I bet

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,620
and the truth is it's like we're not

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:27,890
stuck with legacy views and different

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,890
things as I've said before earlier on in

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,160
this thing I said earlier on

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,690
we've changed technologies hundreds of

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,820
sites maybe dozens of times over the

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,310
years if you're still using the same

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,830
technology you were five years ago or

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,709
three years ago you're already out of

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,510
date sure there's a there's a job for

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,209
somebody to go keep the COBOL machine

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,910
running or keep a mainframe running I

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:54,830
say whoo two minutes okay peace or is

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,660
that peace I don't know we go with

00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,200
several way it works on that one that's

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,430
yeah most the time it's just um

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,320
yeah most of time I see I didn't fit

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,790
into the demographics of this speech I

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,010
think Todd walked behind the other day

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,360
didn't realize I was speaking so there's

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:13,839
one of those funny things but but this

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,209
is a it is it gets interesting thing I'm

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:22,180
wrap up on this one because right now

00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:24,620
I've hit my mid 50s this is when all the

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,890
documentation out there says I'm hitting

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,700
my peak salary realize that and I keep

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,640
looking at my thinking I still got 15

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:39,380
years left to work what's the motivation

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,029
and and I think and that's where and

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,650
that's what it is it's like weird you

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,540
give up on people who've been here

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,020
forever that all of a sudden I become a

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,410
bad worker I saw Scott's works with me

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,420
he's nodding I can see that he has he

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,900
sits beside me - I have plants all over

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,890
my desk I'm very annoying to sit beside

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,520
that's why I only come into the office

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:04,520
two days a week now but I'm hitting my

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,250
peak salary one thing one of my research

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,839
I did notice on this one that women

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,060
actually hit their peak salary in their

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,890
mid-40s I'd haven't I don't really

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,320
understand it I'm sure if people will

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,089
tell me I hope people do cuz I'd like to

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,910
know why but it's just one of those

00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:22,630
other unique things but

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:25,530
a lot of the things I'm talking about

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:29,770
here is what people should do to

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:34,090
mitigate age age discrimination or age

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:38,830
bias because again it's hard to think of

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:41,440
myself as a victim because I've been in

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,050
the middle of exciting technology boom

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,910
over the last thirty years and I don't

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,550
think I am one I haven't been laid off

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,190
yet and I know the real fear is I've

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,100
never feared being laid off but now I

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:59,650
fear finding another job if I do and

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,600
that's the real shift on this one and

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,160
it's so important I think I'm hitting on

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,230
this one this works for almost every

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,740
other thing that might pop up realize

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,870
it's cheaper to retrain and hire new

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,780
that we're more incapable of learning a

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:18,030
new technology we've done it millions of

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,030
times in the past and we'll do it again

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,840
experience saves money more than

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,370
anything else and I'm just reading my

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,290
slides now and yet really I'm really

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:31,270
losing it here I say but it's not

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,570
unusual for this so that you're walking

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:38,380
up in an event you see something that

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,570
you've seen before and then BAM you tell

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,220
your younger manager say I've seen this

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,410
before but not in a way that's demeaning

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,910
to the manager saying he's stupid young

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,550
person no you don't do that kind of

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,860
stuff you explain saying I've seen this

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,350
this is why I think we ought to move in

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,650
this direction and this is a danger that

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,170
we might be running across and you'd be

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,900
surprised how often it does it and you

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,460
know when you have an older worker is

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,580
popular because that's in the hiring

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,550
pool I don't know how many times I've

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,070
liked I'd like to talk to recruiters iv9

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,650
now and then just to feel what the world

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,500
is like on that one how many times that

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:20,110
I talk to them and I start walking to my

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,810
cuz I've done things like shorten my

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,560
resume to the only the last ten years

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,390
the worth of experience you know I

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,940
haven't done two cosmetic surgery to

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,740
make myself look younger yet on that

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,660
side but

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,370
that's that's one of those exciting

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,960
that's one of those exciting things too

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,460
that I hear people are doing like that

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,500
seems a little drastic in my opinion but

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,130
when you go through this stuff and you

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,160
see it

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,850
all of a sudden a recruiter realizes how

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,130
old I am what my salary is right now and

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,050
then they start saying well I don't

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,420
think you're gonna fit for this even

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,790
though they called me first right and

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm not litoris and lose changing jobs

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,330
right now anyway because that's another

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,970
thing that one of those scary things

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,400
about workers to older workers tend to

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,400
be more loyal tend to put up with more

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,620
of them what's the word I can use that

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,410
it goes with like pooping bulk pooping I

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,230
guess yeah baloney whatever it is we

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,900
tend to put up with more of that stuff

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,750
and not demand new things because you

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:29,320
know over time you realize it so that's

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,970
um don't give up don't give up on old

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,620
people feel free to hire them again and

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,870
all the other good stuff and again Todd

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,620
thanks for putting me laughs oh I could

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:46,070
let everybody down so there we go

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,070
[Applause]

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,369
